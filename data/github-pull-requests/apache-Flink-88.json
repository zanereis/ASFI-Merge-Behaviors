you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed and reenabled `IntervalJoinITCase.testRowTimeInnerJoinWithEquiTimeAttrs`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed and reenabled `IntervalJoinITCase.testRowTimeInnerJoinWithEquiTimeAttrs`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis introduces support for `EXTRACT` of `DECADE`, `ISODOW`, `ISOYEAR` in SQL.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests in  and can be verified as follows:\r\n`ScalarFunctionsTest`: added tests for `EXTRACT` of `DECADE`, `ISODOW`, `ISOYEAR`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn FLINK-9373, we introduced RocksIteratorWrapper which was a wrapper around RocksIterator to check the iterator status for all the methods. At that time, it was required because the iterator may pass the blocks or files it had difficulties in reading (because of IO errors, data corruptions, or other issues) and continue with the next available keys. The status flag may not be OK, even if the iterator is valid.\r\n\r\nHowever, the above behaviour changed after 3810 was merged on May 17, 2018:\r\n - If the iterator is valid, the status() is guaranteed to be OK;\r\n - If the iterator is not valid, there are two possibilities:\r\n    1) We have reached the end of the data. And in this case, status() is OK;\r\n    2) There is an error. In this case, status() is not OK;\r\n\r\nMore information can be found here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Iterator#error-handling\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove all the status() calls from existing methods*\r\n  - *Add status() check when the iterator is invalid (as per the best practice in the rocksdb wiki above)*\r\n  - *Update the comments of RocksIteratorWrapper for this change*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe EFO Kinesis connector will register and de-register stream consumers based on the [configured registration strategy](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/connectors/datastream/kinesis/#efo-stream-consumer-registrationderegistration). When EAGER is used, the client (usually job manager) will register the consumer and then the task managers will de-register the consumer when job stops/fails. If the job is configured to restart on fail, then the consumer will not exist and the job will continuously fail over.\r\n\r\nAfter this change the connector will not trigger consumer deregistration in EFO if using the EAGER registration strategy. This will allow EAGER EFO configured connector applications to use restart policies without continuously failing. The documentation is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add dedicated utility function for determining whether consumer deregistration is required.*\r\n  - *Ensure consumer deregistration now only occurs when EFO is configured using the LAZY registration strategy.*\r\n  - *Update the documentation to reflect the changes.* \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nParts of this change are already covered by existing tests in `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kinesis.util.StreamConsumerRegistrarUtilTest`. \r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added unit test to verify deregistration criteria i.e. `org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kinesis.util.StreamConsumerRegistrarUtilTest#testDeregisterStreamConsumersOnlyDeregistersEFOLazilyInitializedConsumers`*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a Flink application with a fixed delay restart strategy and a FlinkKinesisConsumer with EAGER EFO configured.* \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **No**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **No**\r\n  - The serializers: **No**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **No**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: **_Yes_**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **No**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - References to the EAGER EFO deregistration policy have been updated in `datastream/kinesis.md` and `table/kinesis.md`.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-06T08:13:12Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T13:38:22Z","closed_at":"2021-10-07T13:38:22Z","merged_at":"2021-10-07T13:38:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"3887b1d1edd717385813b73a8127c93845f6b6c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273338726,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM4NzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kinesis","name":"component=Connectors/Kinesis","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17417/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17417/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17417/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3c211606b3465a1e719bc1a8f70caa620edc0984","head":{"label":"rudikershaw:FLINK-24431","ref":"FLINK-24431","sha":"3c211606b3465a1e719bc1a8f70caa620edc0984","user":{"login":"rudikershaw","id":15424302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI0MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15424302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw","html_url":"https://github.com/rudikershaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudikershaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2c5e7a4bf15854135c050ab3daa9ef6ca1b43cbf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request improves performance of file sink on Nexmark q10.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Use more efficient `Integer.toHexString` instead of `String.format`\r\n  - Do not allocate new string when there is no escapable char in the original string\r\n  - Allocate `StringBuilder` depending on the original string length instead of the default value\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added test `PartitionPathUtilsTest.testEscapeChar` verifying the original behavior of `String.format` is kept\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSince org.apache.flink.core.fs.Path is a core public interface for the developer to work with the Flink file system. It makes sense to keep the java doc clean and professional. This PR removes the redundant information in the java doc for many methods and remove a code style check warning by the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- clean up the java doc to remove the redundant information.\r\n- remove an \"Unnecessary string length argument\" code style check warning of using substring() method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nMost part of this change is java doc cleanup without any test coverage. The only code change to remove the style check warning is already covered by existing tests, such as *PathTest*.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe approach used before the introduction was to poll the topic with a\r\ngiven timeout and if the poll did not return a record treat it as all\r\nrecords have been read. Unfortunately, due to network issues or similar\r\nthe poll can easily return without any records but end offset was not\r\nreached making the tests unreliable. The new util always drains all\r\nmessages until the end offset is reached.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n-  Migrate all kafka tests reading the topic content to the new util\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Existing tests still pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the logic for the date/time to string casting to table-common, joining our internal `SqlDateTimeUtils` class and `DateTimeUtils` from avatica-core (ASL 2.0 licensed) into a single `DateTimeUtils`. It also introduces a new utils class in the same package, called `StringUtils`, which provides a single method called `toSQLString` for converting any value with either internal or external type to a SQL-conformant string representation.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Fix the errors generated by the metrics code when reading from a Kafka topic that includes periods in the names. The filter for the metric tries to compare the topic name against the corresponding metric `topic` tag, but the metric tags execute a transform on the topic name that replaces any periods with underscores, so if you try to find the records-lag metric in via the changed function, it logs a WARN level log with an exception stack trace.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Execute the required transformation in the `getRecordsLagMetric` function\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately while some of the tests in `KafkaSourceReaderTest` cover this code and changing the topic name in that class to `\"Kafka.Source.Reader.Test\"` even causes the issue, it doesn't actually cause the tests to fail.  Further, the `KafkaSourceReaderMetricsTest` doesn't have any coverage of the `getRecordsLagMetric` function at all, which is disappointing.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Upgrade the used Confluent Platform OSS version in the Bash end-to-end tests to remove Scala 2.11 reference and match with used Kafka version in the tests according to https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/versions-interoperability.html\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Bumped Confluent Platform OSS version to match with the Kafka version that's used by the test\r\n* Using Scala 2.12 version instead of Scala 2.11 version, which now matches with Kafka (which already uses 2.12), unless the needed Confluent Platform OSS version is 6.x: then it will use the available version (there are no separate Scala versions as of version 6)\r\n* Since Confluent Platform was renamed from `oss` to `community`, also updated the URL\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-29T20:45:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T07:34:09Z","closed_at":"2021-09-30T07:34:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e80815450ac135170f3857f3b16bebcb7b9abee0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17391/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17391/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17391/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d138d9015f7bcf93a9ab39d7113a48f8f54dd9a5","head":{"label":"joemoe:joe/1.14-release-notes-dependecies","ref":"joe/1.14-release-notes-dependecies","sha":"d138d9015f7bcf93a9ab39d7113a48f8f54dd9a5","user":{"login":"joemoe","id":68620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe","html_url":"https://github.com/joemoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":411028257,"node_id":"R_kgDOGH_LIQ","name":"flink","full_name":"joemoe/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"joemoe","id":68620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe","html_url":"https://github.com/joemoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joemoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/joemoe/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

PR adds a fallback loader for the akka rpc system, primarily for running tests in the IDE after a clean rebuild _in the IDE_. In that scenario the jars expected by the default loader are not present (in fact no jar is...).\r\n\r\nThis new loader will invoke maven to fetch the dependencies of flink-rpc-akka, and construct a classloader from them.\r\n\r\nThis is very much just a band-aid. It is only for Flink developers and you need to explicitly opt-in (aka, you (and users) cannot affected accidentally).","created_at":"2021-09-29T12:59:31Z","updated_at":"2021-10-11T21:02:12Z","closed_at":"2021-10-04T09:03:47Z","merged_at":"2021-10-04T09:03:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"d89cc77ae3a3b2904fadc49f41c1d6a182c3fbd5","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e05b7b35c17d44cba8540a2182f5a0fd3f10aa3c","head":{"label":"zentol:24367","ref":"24367","sha":"e05b7b35c17d44cba8540a2182f5a0fd3f10aa3c","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.c

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis introduces `Module#getTableSourceFactory` and `Module#getTableSinkFactory`, which allow providing a corresponding factory when sources/sinks are created. The precedence is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Factory defined by the catalog\r\n2. Factory defined by the module\r\n3. Factory discovery\r\n\r\nIt may seem more appropriate to give modules the higher precedence, but in practice it's more useful to prefer the specificity of the catalog and have the module act as a fallback (that can override the discovery process fallback).\r\n\r\nThe changes in `FactoryUtil` have been kept backwards-compatible, but the old methods have been deprecated.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Provide `ModuleManager` in `FlinkContext`\r\n* Introduce the new APIs.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nCompatibility is covered through existing tests. A new `ModuleITCase` has been added to verify the new module APIs.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

slinkydeveloper <francescoguard@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix typo in sources doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Fix typo in sources doc*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that

that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-29T03:02:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d63fd0adde3096eeeab3d3a07963301baddb753","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/af61c2cdd87041b08acd0d52ec63bf39b50bd89a","head":{"label":"BradyYue:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"af61c2cdd87041b08acd0d52ec63bf39b50bd89a","user":{"login":"BradyYue","id":21214368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjE0MzY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21214368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue","html_url":"https://github.com/BradyYue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BradyYue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:release-1.13","ref":"release-1.13","sha":"1057f4171645b48c7743571e9f90e20b94a64900","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe first sentence of the flink Chinese document homepage is not fluent, and an auxiliary word is added to make it fluent.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- `docs/content.zh/_index.md`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T09:53:46Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c1c20e4186b865f153f3c58600478a5b715765f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7087c01013007684ad17ece6883636cd4c1db0d7","head":{"label":"LB-Yu:hotfix-20210928","ref":"hotfix-20210928","sha":"7087c01013007684ad17ece6883636cd4c1db0d7","user":{"login":"LB-Yu","id":44154062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTU0MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44154062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu","html_url":"https://github.com/LB-Yu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":392153308,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTIxNTMzMDg=","name":"flink","full_name":"LB-Yu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LB-Yu","id":44154062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTU0MDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44154062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu","html_url":"https://github.com/LB-Yu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LB-Yu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LB-Yu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T09:25:03Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T07:47:37Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T07:47:37Z","merged_at":"2021-09-29T07:47:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"5452dccfb4e1e80a627647caea63aba3bda0fa79","assignee":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1f761e65aa4c3ce202641a88d2c579f9db8b3567","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-24380-13","ref":"FLINK-24380-13","sha":"1f761e65aa4c3ce202641a88d2c579f9db8b3567","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.githu

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T09:24:32Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T07:46:53Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T07:46:53Z","merged_at":"2021-09-29T07:46:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee4776799ddfca0a7554fbc2d78d640a16eb6ab4","assignee":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/579496274548581d5e08f9597ebfb4644192f86a","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-24380-14","ref":"FLINK-24380-14","sha":"579496274548581d5e08f9597ebfb4644192f86a","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.githu

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix IntervalJoin runtime exception with equality predicate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Key group 89 is not in KeyGroupRange{startKeyGroup=96, endKeyGroup=127}. Unless you're directly using low level state access APIs, this is most likely caused by non-deterministic shuffle key (hashCode and equals implementation).\r\n\tat org.apache.flink.runtime.state.KeyGroupRangeOffsets.newIllegalKeyGroupException(KeyGroupRangeOffsets.java:37)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the planner mistakenly using the time attribute (used in the interval join equality predicate) as part of the exchange distribution key.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Now StreamPhysicalIntervalJoinRule excludes from the exchange keys the time attributes used in the interval join\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added a new planner test to check the exchange distribution keys are computed properly\r\n  - Fixed IntervalJoinITCase which was mistakenly testing a regular join more than an interval join\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T09:10:00Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T08:52:59Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T08:42:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"517e286fe71d0435799fa14a4a4fa156a2a1ad43","assignee":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/54c6684aff5bce94116153d15145e6fd43c754bb","head":{"label":"slinkydeveloper:flink-19792","ref":"flink-19792","sha":"54c6684aff5bce94116153d15145e6fd43c754bb","user":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403633406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM2MzM0MDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"slinkydeveloper/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new page to add module specific guides for flink contributors.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added the new module specific guides doc page\r\n- Added how to debug the sql planner guide\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is only docs\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-28T09:02:02Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T16:08:40Z","closed_at":"2021-11-15T16:08:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc95234b2552a83293991ad4451298cad77baa32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7593fde1bc2d4378e6d5c3709bcc4091d5690cb5","head":{"label":"slinkydeveloper:sql-dev-docs","ref":"sql-dev-docs","sha":"7593fde1bc2d4378e6d5c3709bcc4091d5690cb5","user":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403633406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM2MzM0MDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"slinkydeveloper/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement a sink for Elasticsearch 7 based on the new sink framework (FLIP-143)\r\n\r\n214dffa needs no review it is only temporary until https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17351 has been merged\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n-  Added multiple IT cases covering the overall executions\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24326\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-27T10:02:11Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T07:39:39Z","closed_at":"2021-10-07T07:39:39Z","merged_at":"2021-10-07T07:39:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"cebf1bd9a46447d32dcc173b0105c4e4390cdbb6","assignee":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17363/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17363/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17363/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bee7c870c5607a28c2d2a652601e8efa5b92458d","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-24324","ref":"FLINK-24324","sha":"bee7c870c5607a28c2d2a652601e8efa5b92458d","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}"

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-27T07:52:16Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T07:39:11Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T07:39:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a76b46956ed2112c16bb2c40ba436a0d179ff24e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17362/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17362/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17362/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d6a34e5d67500ab94d9b7c1a5a615ff582388563","head":{"label":"xintongsong:FLINK-24377-TM-heartbeat","ref":"FLINK-24377-TM-heartbeat","sha":"d6a34e5d67500ab94d9b7c1a5a615ff582388563","user":{"login":"xintongsong","id":6509172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDkxNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6509172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong","html_url":"https://github.com/xintongsong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185968889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU5Njg4ODk=","name":"flink","full_name":"xintongsong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xintongsong","id":6509172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDkxNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6509172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong","html_url":"https://github.com/xintongsong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xintongsong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xintongsong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-27T07:52:12Z","updated_at":"2021-09-29T07:46:00Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T07:46:00Z","merged_at":"2021-09-29T07:46:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"b9fbdf8c906aea4fce8881a7b8fb13619f4157ea","assignee":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9bda388e4a0027d01272692a4471fcf1be8a64e7","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-24380","ref":"FLINK-24380","sha":"9bda388e4a0027d01272692a4471fcf1be8a64e7","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/

for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24379\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd missing components required to use the AWS Glue Schema registry in Table connectors.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added GluSchemaRegistryAvroFormatFactory class and reference to same in `flink-formats/flink-avro-glue-schema-registry/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.flink.table.factories.Factory`\r\n  - \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test class org.apache.flink.formats.avro.glue.schema.registry.GlueSchemaRegistryAvroDeserializationSchemaTest based off org.apache.flink.formats.avro.registry.confluent.RegistryAvroFormatFactoryTest\r\n  - Verified that the test passed after some work correcting the options naming.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n    - Adds internal dependency from flink-avro-glue-schema-registry to the table API jars\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no public API changed\r\n  - The serializers: don't know\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? No?  It's adding an existing feature that is present in all the other Avro formats to the AWS Glue Avro format\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? JavaDocs, tweaked from the similar docs in RegistryAvroFormatFactory\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-27T05:00:53Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T16:08:50Z","closed_at":"2023-03-03T16:08:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a5e95474cae72318fa60a1b77f1dfb9b650a12b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3bbe36d1af9b8830e4a8605dced3b1442c53d64e","head":{"label":"jherico:brad_glue-table","ref":"brad_glue-table","sha":"3bbe36d1af9b8830e4a8605dced3b1442c53d64e","user":{"login":"jherico","id":1533642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico","html_url":"https://github.com/jherico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cd7bf3b586e13fe6d258a1507ba4248061b5a45d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the test*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Calculating maximum alignment time rather than using the constant value*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T17:17:37Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T02:38:40Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T02:38:40Z","merged_at":"2021-10-01T02:38:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a9d78259668f3d9c1a52dd278e8502d1449f780","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/69a3d2f47018a277458a8798e02caa7e3abb5779","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24200","ref":"flink-24200","sha":"69a3d2f47018a277458a8798e02caa7e3abb5779","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akalash/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Support 'SHOW CREATE VIEW' syntax to print the query of a view*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*Support 'SHOW CREATE VIEW' syntax to print the query of a view*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- org.apache.flink.table.planner.catalog.CatalogViewITCase\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T12:40:29Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:05:32Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T14:21:48Z","merged_at":"2021-10-26T14:21:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ed7847695e3fe9358353d970ad6b1631f7a2320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c904e97695ec22ed3d3b9fb2a3fce7f8bb13494c","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-10230","ref":"FLINK-10230","sha":"c904e97695ec22ed3d3b9fb2a3fce7f8bb13494c","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n Before this change, if no committer was after the SinkWriter in the pipeline preCommit was never called. With this change, preCommit is now called as well but the return values are discarded as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Call the passed lambda in NoopCommitHandler \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added a test to ensure that preCommit is called if the Sink is configured without a commiter\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T11:59:48Z","updated_at":"2021-09-28T13:25:45Z","closed_at":"2021-09-28T13:25:44Z","merged_at":"2021-09-28T13:25:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fe9f525a92319acc1e3434bebed601306f7a16f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9e4f50836483f3be9932c01af0ca7125d045e1ba","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-24371","ref":"FLINK-24371","sha":"9e4f50836483f3be9932c01af0ca7125d045e1ba","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

slinkydeveloper <francescoguard@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMigrate `AbstractFileSystemTable` to use the new  `ResolvedSchema` APIs as described here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24359\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Now `AbstractFileSystemTable` and inheritors use the new  `ResolvedSchema` APIs. Some usage of the old `TableSchema` persists because it's required by the `FileSystemFormatFactory.ReaderContext` class, but it will be easy to remove once `FileSystemFormatFactory` will be pruned.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests in `org.apache.flink.table.filesystem`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T10:56:10Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T14:19:18Z","closed_at":"2021-10-07T14:10:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d24417665be49a5bd6c016609ea7340daae91c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0a0cd972b9e8406a06ead5f7e9c8fd161340a625","head":{"label":"slinkydeveloper:FLINK-24359","ref":"FLINK-24359","sha":"0a0cd972b9e8406a06ead5f7e9c8fd161340a625","user":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":403633406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM2MzM0MDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"slinkydeveloper/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*User stories:*\r\n* As a Flink user, I’d like to have some documentation for implementing my sink based atop the Asynchronous Sink Base.\r\n\r\n*Context:*\r\n\r\nThe AsyncSinkWriter has already been upstreamed as part of FLINK-24041. This is the accompanying documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added documentation to `docs/content/docs/connectors/datastream/async_base.md`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo changes to code\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? The whole PR is a documentation

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`flink-connector-base` is not a required dependency of the kafka connector therefore therefore we do not have to mention it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-24T07:51:30Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T17:00:12Z","closed_at":"2021-09-24T17:00:12Z","merged_at":"2021-09-24T17:00:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9e256d362b80bbd0291488582581717e5efc59e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d7ae1c1b86aaa3e6a1f515671a3611d94fe83be8","head":{"label":"fapaul:fix-kafkasource-deps-docs","ref":"fix-kafkasource-deps-docs","sha":"d7ae1c1b86aaa3e6a1f515671a3611d94fe83be8","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*User stories:*\r\n* As a Flink user, I’d like to use Kinesis Data Streams as sink for my data pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Context:*\r\n\r\nThe AsyncSinkWriter currently has a static batch size. We’d like to allow Sink users to specify what batch size they would like to use as they are in a better place to choose a batching logic/size for their needs. We’d like to also allow Sink developers to make use of the provided configuration mechanism for their Sink implementations.\r\n\r\n#### Scope:\r\n\r\n* Implement an asynchronous sink for Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) by inheriting the AsyncSinkBase class. The implementation can for now reside in its own module in flink-connectors. The module and package name can be anything reasonable e.g. flink-connector-aws-kinesis for the module name and org.apache.flink.connector.aws.kinesis for the package name. Side-note: There will be additional work later to move these implementations somewhere else (see theongoing discussion) (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/flink-dev/202106.mbox/%3cCAGZNd0EbmGuD327_J4GvDyaOygaewXmjZ9KZN33Fv0v+J8gCcg@mail.gmail.com%3e). \r\n* The implementation must use the Kinesis Java Client (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/AmazonKinesisClient.html). \r\n* The implementation must allow users to configure the Kinesis Client, with reasonable default settings. \r\n* Implement an asynchornous sink writer for KDS by extending the AsyncSinkWriter. The implementation must deal with failed requests and retry them using the requeueFailedRequestEntry method. If possible, the implementation should batch multiple requests (PutRecordsRequestEntry objects) to KDS for increased throughput. The implemented Sink Writer will be used by the Sink class that will be created as part of this story. \r\n* Unit/Integration testing. Use Kinesalite (in-memory Kinesis simulation).

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request follows #14894 which has been inactive for months.\r\nThis pull request addresses review comments in the existing pull request and is based on the existing one.\r\nAll the code changes are targeted to make it possible to push down local aggregations from computing layer to storage layer for better computing & I/O performance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - *Add a new configuration of `table.optimizer.source.aggregate-pushdown-enabled` to control the aggregation push down.*\r\n - *Add an abstract class of `PushLocalAggIntoScanRuleBase` for supporting both with and without sort operator.*\r\n - *Add a new rule of `PushLocalSortAggIntoScanRule` for sort aggregation case.*\r\n - *Add a new rule of `PushLocalSortAggWithSortIntoScanRule` for sort aggregation with sort case.*\r\n - *Add a new rule of `PushLocalSortAggWithSortAndCalcIntoScanRule` for sort aggregation with sort & calc case.*\r\n - *Add a new rule of `PushLocalHashAggIntoScanRule` for hash aggregation case.*\r\n - *Add a new rule of `PushLocalHashAggWithCalcIntoScanRule` for hash aggregation with calc case.*\r\n - *Add new push down spec `AggregatePushDownSpec` to serialize/deserialize aggregations.*\r\n - *Implement the `SupportsAggregatePushDown` interface for `TestValuesScanTableSource`.*\r\n - *Some other unit tests and integration tests.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit test class `PushLocalAggIntoTableSourceScanRuleTest` for plan verifications*\r\n  - *Added integration test class `LocalAggregatePushDownITCase` for end-to-end functional test*\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd more details to the documentation when using table api, filesystem connector and json.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add additional sentence for minio users\r\n- Specify that json format works for append only streams\r\n- Specify that there is no defined ingestion order for the files in a directory when using the filesystem connector\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe test `KafkaSourceReaderTest.testOffsetCommitOnCheckpointComplete` is flaky according to the test failure history in [FLINK-20928](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-20928). This PR attempts to fix this flaky test.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nHere are the problems with the existing code that could explain why the test is flaky:\r\n\r\n1) The test calls `KafkaSourceReader.notifyCheckpointComplete(...)` once and expects the offset commit to be successful. \r\n2) However, `KafkaSourceReader.notifyCheckpointComplete(...)` does not guarantee the offset commit to be successfully. This is because it calls `KafkaConsumer.commitAsync(...)` just once and won't retry even if the commit fails with an retriable exception.\r\n3) During in the test, if the coordinator is temporarily unavailable due to e.g. coordinator movement or network disconnection, the test will fail due to TimeoutException.\r\n\r\nThis PR made the following changes to address the issues described above:\r\n\r\n1) Updated `KafkaSourceReader.notifyCheckpointComplete` so that it can be called multiple times with the same `checkpointId`.\r\n2) Updated `CommonTestUtils.waitUtil(...)` to support user-specified sleep time. Previously `waitUtil(...)` hardcodes the sleep time to be 1 ms.\r\n3) Updated `KafkaSourceReaderTest.testOffsetCommitOnCheckpointComplete` to retry `KafkaSourceReader.notifyCheckpointComplete` once per second until either the offset commit has completed or the max wait time has been reached.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe test `KafkaSourceReaderTest#testOffsetCommitOnCheckpointComplete` could consistently pass across 200 runs.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n- Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n- The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n- The serializers: (no)\r\n- The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n- Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n- The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

testing of multiple expressions at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add the possibility to test multiple TableApi and SQL expressions within on execution, by converting them into multiple table columns. This allows for faster overall test execution.\r\n  - Refactor existing builtin function tests to use this new approach\r\n  - Change some of the existing tests so that both Table API and SQL paths are verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDrop support for the Scala Shell.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Deleted `flink-scala-shell` source code.\r\n- Removed references to module in pom files.\r\n- Do not conditionally build module if using Scala 2.11.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes FLINK-24361 by replacing three with two \r\n\r\nin the time_attributes.md file said:\r\n\r\nThere are three ways to define a processing time attribute.\r\n\r\nbut in the following we only find two ways to define:\r\n\r\nDefining in DDL\r\nDuring DataStream-to-Table Conversion\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nreplacing There are **three** ways to define a processing time attribute to There are **two** ways to define a processing time attribute\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial doc change.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-23T06:30:48Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T13:20:38Z","closed_at":"2021-09-23T13:20:38Z","merged_at":"2021-09-23T13:20:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"a179cd1948fb08053670447e3be0d9e3783cf1d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ad3d3e238bfe2b48b885cfd6e93d10f1a1d4aa76","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-24315-14","ref":"FLINK-24315-14","sha":"ad3d3e238bfe2b48b885cfd6e93d10f1a1d4aa76","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-23T02:12:04Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T13:24:33Z","closed_at":"2021-09-23T13:24:33Z","merged_at":"2021-09-23T13:24:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"901f834f57d705dac6302a706a5d612f4507556a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6587dd0ff71cac9a89027597a79bd49707b2be92","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-24315-13","ref":"FLINK-24315-13","sha":"6587dd0ff71cac9a89027597a79bd49707b2be92","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-22T02:41:16Z","updated_at":"2021-09-22T07:29:01Z","closed_at":"2021-09-22T07:29:01Z","merged_at":"2021-09-22T07:29:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"af4657b7864b5a0c9b1079e036a4135a0f2b9e59","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fad92f7becea65bfd3ae3d9b12a4ee4bf1a5a71b","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-24262","ref":"FLINK-24262","sha":"fad92f7becea65bfd3ae3d9b12a4ee4bf1a5a71b","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the situation when the checkpoint exception happens during the checkpoint initialization and doesn't call the CheckpintFailureManager*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - *Calling the CheckpointFailureManager even if the checkpointId is unknown*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Expanded testTriggerCheckpointAfterIOException test*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
