You might have heard that we’ve integrated LGTM’s underlying CodeQL analysis engine natively into GitHub. The result is [**GitHub code scanning**](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning)!\n\nWith LGTM fully integrated into code scanning, we are focused on improving CodeQL within the native GitHub code scanning experience. In order to take advantage of current and future improvements to our analysis capabilities, we suggest you enable code scanning on your repository. Please take a look at our [blog post for more information](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/).\n\nThis pull request enables code scanning by adding an auto-generated [`codeql.yml` workflow file for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually) to your repository — take a look! Whilst we've attempted to make use of the existing configuration that you had on LGTM.com, there may be some differences in environment used to build the project. We hope that in most cases it will not require significant changes to achieve a successful analysis. Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation on how to configure a CodeQL workflow.\n\nQuestions? Check out the FAQ below!\n\n### FAQ\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>\n\n#### How often will the code scanning analysis run?\nBy default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:\n* On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.\n* On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.\n* Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened.\n\n#### What will this cost?\nNothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions).\n\n#### What types of problems does CodeQL find?\nThe CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you.\n\n#### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?\nNo need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version.\n\n#### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working\nIf you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis.\n\n#### How do I disable LGTM.com?\nIf you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)).\n\n#### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?\nGitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you’d like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub.\n\n#### How do I know this PR is legitimate?\nThis PR is filed by the official LGTM.com GitHub App, in line with the [deprecation timeline that was announced on the official GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/). The proposed GitHub Action workflow uses the [official open source GitHub CodeQL Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/). If you have any other questions or concerns, please join the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29534) in the official GitHub community!\n\n#### I have another question / how do I get in touch?\nPlease join the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29534) to ask further questions and send us suggestions!\n\n</details>

Security Vulnerability Fix\n\nThis pull request fixes a Temporary File Information Disclosure Vulnerability, which existed in this project.\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe system temporary directory is shared between all users on most unix-like systems (not MacOS, or Windows). Thus, code interacting with the system temporary directory must be careful about file interactions in this directory, and must ensure that the correct file posix permissions are set.\n\nThis PR was generated because a call to `File.createTempFile(..)` was detected in this repository in a way that makes this project vulnerable to local information disclosure.\nWith the default uname configuration, `File.createTempFile(..)` creates a file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file.\n\n### Impact\n\nInformation in this file is visible to other local users, allowing a malicious actor co-resident on the same machine to view potentially sensitive files.\n\n#### Other Examples\n\n - [CVE-2020-15250](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp) - junit-team/junit\n - [CVE-2021-21364](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hpv8-9rq5-hq7w) - swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2) - netty/netty\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q) - netty/netty\n\n# The Fix\n\nThe fix has been to convert the logic above to use the following API that was introduced in Java 1.7.\n\n```java\nFile tmpDir = Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\").toFile();\n```\n\nThe API both creates the file securely, ie. with a random, non-conflicting name, with file permissions that only allow the currently executing user to read or write the contents of this file.\nBy default, `Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\")` will create a file with the permissions `-rw-------`, which only allows the user that created the file to view/write the file contents.\n\n# :arrow_right: Vulnerability Disclosure :arrow_left:\n\n:wave: Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!\n\nFirst question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!\n\n 1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!\n 2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To\n\nYou have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:\n\n 1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.\n 2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the [Snyk's Disclosure Email](mailto:report@snyk.io).\n\n## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\n\nThis vulnerability was automatically detected by GitHub's CodeQL using this [CodeQL Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure/).\n\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).\n\nI'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.\n\n## Source\n\nThis contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly hand crafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\n\nThe source code that generated this PR can be found here:\n[SecureTempFileCreation](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/SecureTempFileCreation.java)\n\n## Opting-Out\n\nIf you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:\n\n```\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research\nDisallow: *\n```\n\nThis bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.\n\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.\n\n## CLA Requirements\n\n_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._\n\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin\n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Sponsorship & Support\n\nThis contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.\n\nThis PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.\n\n## Tracking\n\nAll PR's generated as part of this fix are tracked here:

is a security fix for a high-severity vulnerability in your [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) `build.gradle` file(s).\n\nThe build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.\nThis leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a [Man in the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.\n\nThis vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of [8.1/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\n[POC code](https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/) has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.\nMITM attacks against HTTP are [increasingly common](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050), for example [Comcast is known to have done it to their own users](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/#).\n\n## References\n\n- [Want to take over the Java ecosystem?

However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Sponsorship & Support\n\nThis contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate\nDan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.\n\nThis PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n在 kylin4 的StorageCleanupJob 中增加对无引用的 cube_stataistics 数据清理，我认为是有意义的：\r\n1. 可以降低无用数据占用的存储空间，同时避免过多无用小文件对nn的压力\r\n2. 默认情况下清理无引用的 cube_stataistics 数据，但可以通过   -cleanupCubeStatistics false 禁用\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to v3.x\r\n- [x] Branch **kylin4** for v4.x\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin5** for v5.x\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-03T09:11:03Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T12:46:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74815f5ee5ece8e26318cd4eddfe90a592c4302a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1966/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1966/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1966/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/00844f3269e07e9d827ba40c58b2f6cd40e71279","head":{"label":"liuzhao-lz:kylin4-5238","ref":"kylin4-5238","sha":"00844f3269e07e9d827ba40c58b2f6cd40e71279","user":{"login":"liuzhao-lz","id":49258176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjU4MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49258176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzhao-lz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506914249,"node_id":"R_kgDOHjblyQ","name":"kylin","full_name":"liuzhao-lz/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzhao-lz","id":49258176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjU4MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49258176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzhao-lz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzhao-lz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzhao-lz/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n修复在kylin4中当以 spark.master=yarn，spark.submit.deployMode=cluster 提交build job，如在job执行中发生异常，然而最终显示的job状态却为success。我发现问题主要出在org.apache.spark.application.JobWorkSpace 上：\r\norg.apache.spark.application.JobWorkSpace#execute 调用 run 方法，run 方法中会调用 eventLoop.post(RunJob())，JobWorker 在收到  RunJob 后会执行它的 execute() 方法，execute() 方法执行中发生异常会在catche

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix jobs list with sortBy which is `total_duration` instead of `duration`\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-26T04:39:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T10:37:03Z","closed_at":"2022-08-26T10:37:02Z","merged_at":"2022-08-26T10:37:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a85d6f528f0a75e5d363f2166ac9363982cbc2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/1954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/issues/1954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kylin/statuses/32adfede6588c42fe578090150829b2fc76aba5e","head":{"label":"Mukvin:fix-jobs-list","ref":"fix-jobs-list","sha":"32adfede6588c42fe578090150829b2fc76aba5e","user":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260150182,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNTAxODI=","name":"kylin","full_name":"Mukvin/kylin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mukvin","id":34978943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTc4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34978943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mukvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mukvin/kylin","description":"Apache

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdd how_to_contribute.md\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdd how_to_contribute.md\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nmake some changes on the page of how_to_write_document.md\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdd how_to_write_doc\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDoc for How to debug in IDEA.\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nAdd doc installation for apache hadoop 3.2.1 platfom\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nMinor fix and Support to run kylin 5.0 on hadoop 3.2.1 platform\r\n\r\n## Github Branch \r\n\r\nAs most of the development works are on Kylin 4, we need to switch it as main branch. Apache Kylin community changes the branch settings on Github since 2021-08-04 :\r\n\r\n1. The default branch _main_ is for **Kylin 4.x** (Parquet storage);\r\n2. The original branch _master_ for **Kylin 3.x** (HBase storage) has been renamed to **kylin3** ;\r\n\r\nPlease check [Intro to Kylin 4 architecture](https://kylin.apache.org/blog/2021/07/02/Apache-Kylin4-A-new-storage-and-compute-architecture/) and [INFRA-22166](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22166) if you are interested.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why
