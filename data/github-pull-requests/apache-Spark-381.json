This PR makes the generated SQL get eagerly analyzed. So, when a generated SQL has any analysis error, we can see the error message created by\n\n```\n                  case NonFatal(e) => fail(\n                    s\"\"\"Failed to analyze the converted SQL string:\n                        |\n                        |# Original HiveQL query string:\n                        |$queryString\n                        |\n                        |# Resolved

                   \"\"\".stripMargin, e)\n```\n\nRight now, if we can parse a generated SQL but fail to analyze it, we will see error message generated by the following code (it only mentions that we cannot execute the original query, i.e. `queryString`).\n\n```\n            case e: Throwable =>\n              val errorMessage =\n                s\"\"\"\n                  |Failed to execute query

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a more aggressive version of PR #11820, which not only fixes the original problem, but also does the following updates to enforce the at-most-one-qualifier constraint:\n- Renames `NamedExpression.qualifiers` to `NamedExpression.qualifier`\n- Uses `Option[String]` rather than `Seq[String]` for `NamedExpression.qualifier`\n\nQuoted PR description of #11820 here:\n\n> Current implementations of `AttributeReference.sql` and `Alias.sql` joins all available qualifiers, which is logically wrong. But this implementation mistake doesn't cause any real SQL generation bugs though, since there is always at most one qualifier for any given `AttributeReference` or `Alias`.\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent implementations of `AttributeReference.sql` and `Alias.sql` joins all available qualifiers, which is logically wrong. But this implementation mistake doesn't cause any real SQL generation bugs though, since there is always at most one qualifier for any given `AttributeReference` or `Alias`.\n\nThis PR fixes this issue by only picking the first qualifiers.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\n\nExisting tests should be enough.\n","created_at":"2016-03-18T10:58:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T17:21:37Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T16:24:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ae3d5c21b67386583d5870ccd4da19ba3f42f74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a35c8af86e6d704a47b3398cfb6a3bfc12b7947","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14004-single-qualifier","ref":"spark-14004-single-qualifier","sha":"1a35c8af86e6d704a47b3398cfb6a3bfc12b7947","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13908\n\nCurrently we use a `CollectLimit` plan for the limit operator as latest operator to collect data. As `CollectLimit` can't be integrated with `WholeStageCodegen` plan, if there are not any `LocalLimit` plans pushdowned before, we wouldn't limit the data early in wholestage codege. This patch adds an additional `LocalLimit` after `CollectLimit` for solving this issue.\n\nThe executed plan without this patch:\n\n```\nCollectLimit 5\n+- WholeStageCodegen\n   :  +- Range 0, 1, 2,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to support order by position in SQL, e.g.\n\n``` SQL\nselect c1, c2, c3 from tbl order by 1 desc, 3\n```\n\nshould be equivalent to\n\n``` SQL\nselect c1, c2, c3 from tbl order by c1 desc, c3 asc\n```\n\nThis is controlled by config option `spark.sql.orderByOrdinal`.\n- When true, the ordinal numbers are treated as the position in the select list.\n- When false, the ordinal number in order/sort By clause are ignored.\n- Only convert integer literals (not foldable expressions). If found foldable expressions, ignore them\n- This also works with select *.\n\n**Question**: Do we still need sort by columns that contain zero reference? In this case, it will have no impact on the sorting results. IMO, we should not allow users do it. @rxin @cloud-fan @marmbrus @yhuai @hvanhovell \n-- Update: In these cases, they are ignored in this case.\n\n**Note**: This PR is taken from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10731. When merging this PR, please give the credit to @zhichao-li\n\nAlso cc all the people who are involved in the previous discussion: @adrian-wang @chenghao-intel @tejasapatil \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a few test cases for both positive and negative test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-03-18T06:42:47Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T10:10:35Z","closed_at":"2016-03-21T10:10:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9e8dc4de5feacf0de9886761d9b6ac7d15b0ebf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11815/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11815/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11815/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46e3f69103efd036a55775b6e5e3f998567df3c0","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:orderByPosition","ref":"orderByPosition","sha":"46e3f69103efd036a55775b6e5e3f998567df3c0","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13996\n\nFilter codegen finds the attributes not null by checking IsNotNull(a) expression with a condition if child.output.contains(a). However, the current approach to checking it is not comprehensive. We can improve it.\n\nE.g., for this plan:\n\n```\nval rdd = sqlContext.sparkContext.makeRDD(Seq(Row(1, \"1\"), Row(null, \"1\"), Row(2, \"2\")))\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"k\", IntegerType).add(\"v\", StringType)\nval smallDF = sqlContext.createDataFrame(rdd, schema)\nval df = smallDF.filter(\"isnotnull(k + 1)\")\n```\n\nThe code snippet generated without this patch:\n\n```\n/* 031 */   protected void processNext() throws java.io.IOException {\n/* 032 */     /*** PRODUCE: Filter isnotnull((k#0 + 1)) */\n/* 033 */\n/* 034 */     /*** PRODUCE: INPUT */\n/* 035 */\n/* 036 */     while (!shouldStop() && inputadapter_input.hasNext()) {\n/* 037 */       InternalRow inputadapter_row = (InternalRow) inputadapter_input.next();\n/* 038 */       /*** CONSUME: Filter isnotnull((k#0 + 1)) */\n/* 039 */       /* input[0, int] */\n/* 040 */       boolean filter_isNull = inputadapter_row.isNullAt(0);\n/* 041 */       int filter_value = filter_isNull ? -1 : (inputadapter_row.getInt(0));\n/* 042 */\n/* 043 */       /* isnotnull((input[0, int] + 1)) */\n/* 044 */       /* (input[0, int] + 1) */\n/* 045 */       boolean filter_isNull3 = true;\n/* 046 */       int filter_value3 = -1;\n/* 047 */   \n/* 048 */       if (!filter_isNull) {\n/* 049 */         filter_isNull3 = false; // resultCode could change nullability.\n/* 050 */         filter_value3 = filter_value + 1;\n/* 051 */     \n/* 052 */       }\n/* 053 */       if (!(!(filter_isNull3))) continue;\n/* 054 */   \n/* 055 */       filter_metricValue.add(1);\n```\n\nWith this patch:\n\n```\n/*

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13995\n\nWe infer relative `IsNotNull` constraints from logical plan's expressions in `constructIsNotNullConstraints` now. However, we don't consider the case of (nested) `Cast`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nval tr = LocalRelation('a.int, 'b.long)\nval plan = tr.where('a.attr === 'b.attr).analyze\n```\n\nThen, the plan's constraints will have `IsNotNull(Cast(resolveColumn(tr, \"a\"), LongType))`, instead of `IsNotNull(resolveColumn(tr, \"a\"))`. This PR fixes it.\n\nBesides, as `IsNotNull` constraints are most useful for `Attribute`, we should do recursing through any `Expression` that is null intolerant and construct `IsNotNull` constraints for all `Attribute`s under these Expressions.\n\nFor example, consider the following constraints:\n\n```\nval df = Seq((1,2,3)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\ndf.where(\"a + b = c\").queryExecution.analyzed.constraints\n```\n\nThe inferred isnotnull constraints should be isnotnull(a), isnotnull(b), isnotnull(c), instead of isnotnull(a + c) and isnotnull(c).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest is added into `ConstraintPropagationSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-18T02:57:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:20Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T20:02:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bac42b8b280f2dc3046c4bd8e3e310e80cf687c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec84c5f6fe3cf3d03a7629d3867324a95e63c2d5","head":{"label":"viirya:constraint-cast","ref":"constraint-cast","sha":"ec84c5f6fe3cf3d03a7629d3867324a95e63c2d5","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

However, the default value in Hadoop 2.x is record level compression as described in [mapred-site.xml](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.1/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/mapred-default.xml).\n\nSince it drops Hadoop 1.x, it will make sense to use Hadoop 2.x

patch adds support for caching blocks in the executor processes using direct / off-heap memory.\n## User-facing changes\n\n**Updated semantics of `OFF_HEAP` storage level**: In Spark 1.x, the `OFF_HEAP` storage level indicated that an RDD should be cached in Tachyon. Spark 2.x removed the external block store API that Tachyon caching was based on (see #10752 / SPARK-12667), so `OFF_HEAP` became an alias for `MEMORY_ONLY_SER`. As of this patch, `OFF_HEAP` means \"serialized and cached in off-heap memory or on disk\". Via the `StorageLevel` constructor, `useOffHeap` can be set if `serialized == true` and can be used to construct custom storage levels which support replication.\n\n**Storage UI reporting**: the storage UI will now report whether in-memory blocks are stored on- or off-heap.\n\n**Only supported by UnifiedMemoryManager**: for simplicity, this feature is only supported when the default UnifiedMemoryManager is used; applications which use the legacy memory manager (`spark.memory.useLegacyMode=true`) are not currently able to allocate off-heap storage memory, so using off-heap caching will fail with an error when legacy memory management is enabled. Given that we plan to eventually remove the legacy memory manager, this is not a significant restriction.\n\n**Memory management policies:** the policies for dividing available memory between execution and storage are the same for both on- and off-heap memory. For off-heap memory, the total amount of memory available for use by Spark is controlled by `spark.memory.offHeap.size`, which is an absolute size. Off-heap storage memory obeys `spark.memory.storageFraction` in order to control the amount of unevictable storage memory. For example, if `spark.memory.offHeap.size` is 1 gigabyte and Spark uses the default `storageFraction` of 0.5, then up to 500 megabytes of off-heap cached blocks will be protected from eviction due to execution memory pressure. If necessary, we can split `spark.memory.storageFraction` into separate on- and off-heap configurations, but this doesn't seem necessary now and can be done later without any breaking changes.\n\n**Use of off-heap memory does not imply use of off-heap execution (or vice-versa)**: for now, the settings controlling the use of off-heap execution memory (`spark.memory.offHeap.enabled`) and off-heap caching are completely independent, so Spark SQL can be configured to use off-heap memory for execution while continuing to cache blocks on-heap. If desired, we can change this in a followup patch so that `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled` affect the default storage level for cached SQL tables.\n## Internal changes\n- Rename `ByteArrayChunkOutputStream` to `ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream`\n  - It now returns a `ChunkedByteBuffer` instead of an array of byte arrays.\n  - Its constructor now accept an `allocator` function which is called to allocate `ByteBuffer`s. This allows us to control whether it allocates regular ByteBuffers or off-heap DirectByteBuffers.\n  - Because block serialization is now performed during the unroll process, a `ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream` which is configured with a `DirectByteBuffer` allocator will use off-heap memory for both unroll and storage memory.\n- The `MemoryStore`'s MemoryEntries now tracks whether blocks are stored on- or off-heap.\n  - `evictBlocksToFreeSpace()` now accepts a `MemoryMode` parameter so that we don't try to evict off-heap blocks in response to on-heap memory pressure (or vice-versa).\n- Make sure that off-heap buffers are properly de-allocated during MemoryStore eviction.\n- The JVM limits the total size of allocated direct byte buffers using the `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` flag and the default tends to be fairly low (< 512 megabytes in some JVMs). To work around this limitation, this patch adds a custom DirectByteBuffer allocator which ignores this memory

PR relaxes the requirements of a `Sink` for structured streaming to only require idempotent appending of data.  Previously the `Sink` needed to be able to transactionally append data while recording an opaque offset indicated how far in a stream we have processed.\n\nIn order to do this, a new write-ahead-log has been added to stream execution, which records the offsets that will are present in each batch.  The log is created in the newly added `checkpointLocation`, which defaults to `${spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation}/${queryName}` but can be overriden by setting `checkpointLocation` in `DataFrameWriter`.\n\nIn addition to making sinks easier to write the addition of batchIds and a checkpoint location is done in anticipation of integration with the the `StateStore` (#11645).\n","created_at":"2016-03-18T00:09:20Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T17:20:31Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T17:20:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7a37d40c6aa9f386abbc686c9e3f144c5e7af79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/042d969eee0c5c3f6857cd0422053ba63ce8a39f","head":{"label":"marmbrus:batchIds","ref":"batchIds","sha":"042d969eee0c5c3f6857cd0422053ba63ce8a39f","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

on the `SerializerManager` introduced in SPARK-13926/ #11755, this patch Spark modifies Spark's BlockManager to use RDD's ClassTags in order to select the best serializer to use when caching RDD blocks.\n\nWhen storing a local block, the BlockManager `put()` methods use implicits to record ClassTags and stores those tags in the blocks' BlockInfo records. When reading a local block, the stored ClassTag is used to pick the appropriate serializer. When a block is stored with replication, the class tag is written into the block transfer metadata and will also be stored in the remote BlockManager.\n\nThere are two or three places where we don't properly pass ClassTags, including TorrentBroadcast and BlockRDD. I think this happens to work because the missing ClassTag always happens to be `ClassTag.Any`, but it might be worth looking more carefully at those places to see whether we should be more explicit.\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T23:11:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T00:27:41Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T00:21:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e80d27aa25661b9a778c4720ec7aa9795b61adc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8793a1dbf546d1db8ceeda2e91edc1a084046f33","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:pick-best-serializer-for-caching","ref":"pick-best-serializer-for-caching","sha":"8793a1dbf546d1db8ceeda2e91edc1a084046f33","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

Without this patch UI does not render any app for almost 30 seconds and then big2 and small1 appears. another 30 second delay and finally big1 also shows up in UI.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis improves the Filter codegen for NULLs by deferring loading the values for IsNotNull.\nInstead of generating code like:\n\nboolean isNull = ...\nint value = ...\nif (isNull) continue;\n\nwe will generate:\nboolean isNull = ...\nif (isNull) continue;\nint value = ...\n\nThis is useful since retrieving the values can be non-trivial (they can be dictionary encoded\namong other things). This currently only works when the attribute comes from the column batch\nbut could be extended to other cases in the future.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nOn tpcds q55, this fixes the regression from introducing the IsNotNull predicates.\n\n```\nTPCDS Snappy:                       Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per

a block is persisted in the MemoryStore at a serialized storage level, the current MemoryStore.putIterator() code will unroll the entire iterator as Java objects in memory, then will turn around and serialize an iterator obtained from the unrolled array. This is inefficient and doubles our peak memory requirements.\n\nInstead, I think that we should incrementally serialize blocks while unrolling them.\n\nA downside to incremental serialization is the fact that we will need to deserialize the partially-unrolled data in case there is not enough space to unroll the block and the block cannot be dropped to disk. However, I'm hoping that the memory efficiency improvements will outweigh any performance losses as a result of extra serialization in that hopefully-rare

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI believe this is a critical bug in the Spark related to cast, which is found by running the TPC tests.\nUse case:\nUser table (T) has one column (COL) which is FLOAT data type, it has tuple as (1.49f). the query is:\n\n```\nselect COL from T where COL = 1.49, or\nselect COL from T where COL between 0 and 1.49\n```\n\nSpark will return nothing. Here is the reason in Scala (try to use Scala shell to test):\n\n```\nval a = 1.49f  #a: Float = 1.49\nval b = 1.49  #b: Double = 1.49\nval c = a == b #c: Boolean = false\nval d = a <= b #d: Boolean = false\n```\n\nFrom above, we can see that casting a FLOAT to DOUBLE will not guarantee the comparison is still correct. There are many use cases that user will use =, <=, between in the queries, so it will affect the accuracy quite a lot.\n\nThe solution is to use FLOAT type if the column type is FLOAT and value is within the FLOAT range, else we will still use DOUBLE.\n\n1.49 is the number I found with this cast issue, there may be more.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI did a full test for SQL, updated the expected results for a test suite, and also add a new test case for this scenario.\n\nAll tests are passed for now.\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T18:08:54Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T22:12:05Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T01:08:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d35b95256256369a863aaf5ac1d43acaa14a9800","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f261a90a08b5559fce8b40cf9e3eff26ec1b3a6","head":{"label":"bomeng:SPARK-13858","ref":"SPARK-13858","sha":"7f261a90a08b5559fce8b40cf9e3eff26ec1b3a6","user":{"login":"bomeng","id":295781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng","html_url":"https://github.com/bomeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b39e80d39dae8e6779f9d78c1631a27585239032","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nShuffledHashJoin (also outer join) is removed in 1.6, in favor of SortMergeJoin, which is more robust and also fast.\n\nShuffledHashJoin is still useful in this case: 1) one table is much smaller than the other one, then cost to build a hash table on smaller table is smaller than sorting the larger table 2) any partition of the small table could fit in memory.\n\nThis PR brings back ShuffledHashJoin, basically revert #9645, and fix the conflict. Also merging outer join and left-semi join into the same class. This PR does not implement full outer join, because it's not implemented efficiently (requiring build hash table on both side).\n\nA simple benchmark (one table is 5x smaller than other one) show that ShuffledHashJoin could be 2X faster than SortMergeJoin.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests for ShuffledHashJoin.\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T17:40:55Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T18:04:12Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T17:40:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6519eacd86c5a3413828e0db7ca4f150b11c051","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11788/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11788/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11788/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dea36152dbc6cc556182ece3211f62a8ca186b15","head":{"label":"davies:shuffle_join","ref":"shuffle_join","sha":"dea36152dbc6cc556182ece3211f62a8ca186b15","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe haven't figured out the corrected logical to add sub-queries yet, so we should not clear all sub-queries before generate SQL. This PR changed the logic to only remove sub-queries above table relation.\n\nan example for this bug, original SQL: `SELECT a FROM (SELECT a FROM tbl) t WHERE a = 1`\nbefore this PR, we will generate:\n\n```\nSELECT attr_1 AS a FROM\n  SELECT attr_1 FROM (\n    SELECT a AS attr_1 FROM tbl \n  ) AS sub_q0\n  WHERE attr_1 = 1\n```\n\nWe missed a sub-query and this SQL string is illegal.\n\nAfter this PR, we will generate:\n\n```\nSELECT attr_1 AS a FROM (\n  SELECT attr_1 FROM (\n    SELECT a AS attr_1 FROM tbl \n  ) AS sub_q0\n  WHERE attr_1 = 1\n) AS t\n```\n\nTODO: for long term, we should find a way to add sub-queries correctly, so that arbitrary logical plans can be converted to SQL string.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`LogicalPlanToSQLSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T16:12:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T02:18:30Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T02:18:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59859ff46ab02d8869d3db529a6f728deb3961bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee5a43739b895708c054558c62263a6a59aa4b1e","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:bug-fix","ref":"bug-fix","sha":"ee5a43739b895708c054558c62263a6a59aa4b1e","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\njira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8884\nThis is a continued work of @josepablocam in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/7278. \n\nAs sync in jira, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8884, I'll help with the rest work. I've resolved the conflict, updated links and rewrote the implementation following the original formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson%E2%80%93Darling_test. A new ut is also added for weibull and gumbel distribution.\n\nWe have implemented one-sample Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test to add to the current hypothesis testing functionality. The current implementation supports various distributions (normal, exponential, gumbel, logistic, and weibull). However, users must provide distribution parameters. In contrast to other tests, such as the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, we only support specific distributions as the critical values depend on the distribution being tested.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests and some manual comparison with R and Python.\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T09:34:39Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T05:17:31Z","closed_at":"2017-03-16T05:16:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6ec7bce2a38f922611afe5ef7c0b0e1760f4db4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11780/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11780/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11780/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5e5035896f78554c29d271956ebdf034274e5b5","head":{"label":"hhbyyh:adtest","ref":"adtest","sha":"e5e5035896f78554c29d271956ebdf034274e5b5","user":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29568485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTU2ODQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"hhbyyh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hhbyyh","id":7981698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODE2OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7981698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh","html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhbyyh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hhbyyh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nA relatively simple transformation is missing from Catalyst's arsenal - generation of transitive predicates. For instance, if you have got the following query:\n`select * \nfrom   table1 t1\njoin   table2 t2\non     t1.a = t2.b\nwhere  t1.a = 42`\nthen it is a fair assumption that t2.b also equals 42 hence an additional predicate could be generated. The additional predicate could in turn be pushed down through the join and improve performance of the whole query by filtering out the data before joining it.\nSuch a transformation exists in Oracle DB.\nPlease note, in this PR a transitive predicate would be created for the following operations: \n- a BinaryComparison (=, >=, etc.) to a foldable\n- in (1, 2, 3) where all the values in the sequence are foldable\n- Not of any of the above\n- Or of any of the above\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI've added a new TransitiveClosureSuite with a series of unit tests\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T08:48:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-19T22:54:52Z","closed_at":"2016-03-19T15:29:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11777/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11777/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11777/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7df4117749f7afc2e5e95190cf93a961b9c6ed3a","head":{"label":"antonoal:transitive-closure","ref":"transitive-closure","sha":"7df4117749f7afc2e5e95190cf93a961b9c6ed3a","user":{"login":"antonoal","id":11347223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11347223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal","html_url":"https://github.com/antonoal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54067628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDA2NzYyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"antonoal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"antonoal","id":11347223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ3MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11347223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal","html_url":"https://github.com/antonoal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonoal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/antonoal/spark","description":"Mirror

IllegalArgumentException: Can not create a Path from an empty string for incorrect file path\n\n**Overview:**\n-   If a non-existent path is given in this call\n  `\n  scala> sqlContext.read.format(\"csv\").load(\"file-path-is-incorrect.csv\")\n  `\n  it throws the following error:\n  `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can not create a Path from an empty string` ….. \n  `It gets called from inferSchema call in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation`\n-   The purpose of this JIRA is to throw a better error message. \n-   With the fix, you will now get a _Path does not exist_ error message. \n\n```\nscala> sqlContext.read.format(\"csv\").load(\"file-path-is-incorrect.csv\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Path does not exist: file:/Users/ksunitha/trunk/spark/file-path-is-incorrect.csv;\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource$$anonfun$12.apply(DataSource.scala:215)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource$$anonfun$12.apply(DataSource.scala:204)\n  ...\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:204)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:131)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:141)\n  ... 49 elided\n```\n\n**Details**\n_Changes include:_\n-   Check if path exists or not in resolveRelation in DataSource, and throw an AnalysisException with message like “Path does not exist: $path”\n-   AnalysisException is thrown similar to the exceptions thrown in resolveRelation.\n-   The glob path and the non glob path is checked with minimal calls to path exists. If the globPath is empty, then it is a nonexistent glob pattern and an error will be thrown. In the scenario that it is not globPath, it is necessary to only check if the first element in the Seq is valid or not. \n\n_Test modifications:_\n-   Changes went in for 3 tests to account for this error checking.\n-   SQLQuerySuite:test(\"run sql directly on files\") – Error message needed to be updated.\n-   2 tests failed in MetastoreDataSourcesSuite because they had a dummy path and so test is modified to give a tempdir and allow it to move past so it can continue to test the codepath it meant to test\n\n_New Tests:_\n2 new tests are added to DataFrameSuite to validate that glob and non-glob path will throw the new error message.  \n\n_Testing:_\nUnit tests were run with the fix.\n\n**Notes/Questions to reviewers:**\n-   There is some code duplication in DataSource.scala in resolveRelation method and also createSource with respect to getting the paths.  I have not made any changes to the createSource codepath.  Should we make the change there as well ? \n-   From other JIRAs, I know there is restructuring and changes going on in this area, not sure how that will affect these changes, but since this seemed like a starter issue, I looked into it.  If we prefer not to add the overhead of the checks, or if there is a better place to do so, let me know.  \n\nI would appreciate your review. Thanks for your time and comments.\n","created_at":"2016-03-17T00:27:05Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T18:31:40Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T12:50:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b83b502f2392d4d43f513320180d1f0864c28c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02b8e74b4a402f8a9bba37cd6d88e37fe80cc731","head":{"label":"skambha:improve_errmsg","ref":"improve_errmsg","sha":"02b8e74b4a402f8a9bba37cd6d88e37fe80cc731","user":{"login":"skambha","id":16563220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTYzMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16563220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha","html_url":"https://github.com/skambha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49237548,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTIzNzU0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skambha/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skambha","id":16563220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTYzMjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16563220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha","html_url":"https://github.com/skambha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skambha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skambha/spark","description":"Mirror

excludes are currently generated using both the current Spark version's classes and Spark 1.2.0's classes, but this doesn't make sense: we should only be ignoring classes which were `private` in the previous Spark version, not classes which became private in the current version.\n\nThis patch updates `dev/mima` to only generate excludes with respect to the previous artifacts that MiMa checks against. It also updates `MimaBuild` so that `excludeClass` only applies directly to the class being excluded and not to its companion object (since a class and its companion object can have different

https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/53176/consoleFull. \n\nThis PR uses the constraints to avoid pushing any predicate that already exists in its child's Constraints. Also, it will not pushing any predicate that does not contain any reference, since it could introduce the same issue.\n\nWill introduce the same idea in the similar rules:\n-       PushPredicateThroughJoin,\n-       PushPredicateThroughGenerate,\n-       PushPredicateThroughAggregate,\n-       SetOperationPushDown\n\nShould I do it in the same PR? or different PRs? @marmbrus

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI'm seeing several PR builder builds fail after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11725/files. Example:\n\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test/job/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.4/lastFailedBuild/console\n\n```\ntestCommunication(org.apache.spark.launcher.LauncherServerSuite)  Time elapsed: 0.023 sec  <<< FAILURE!\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<app-id> but was:<null>\n    at org.apache.spark.launcher.LauncherServerSuite.testCommunication(LauncherServerSuite.java:93)\n```\n\nHowever, other builds pass this same test, including the test when run locally and on the Jenkins PR builder. The failure itself concerns a change to how the test waits on a condition, and the wait can time out; therefore I think this is due to fast/slow machine differences.\n\nThis is an attempt at a hot fix; it's a little hard to verify since locally and on the PR builder, it passes anyway. The change itself should be harmless anyway.\n\nWhy didn't this happen before, if the new logic was supposed to be equivalent to the old? I think this is the sequence:\n- First attempt to acquire semaphore for 10ms actually silently times out\n- The changed being waited for happens just after that, a bit too late\n- Assertion passes since condition became true just in time\n- `release()` fires from the listener\n- Next `tryAcquire` however immediately succeeds because the first `tryAcquire` didn't acquire anything, but its subsequent condition is not yet true; this would explain why the second one always fails\n\nVersus the original using `notifyAll()`, there's a small difference: `wait()`-ing after `notifyAll()` just results in another wait; it doesn't make it return immediately. So this was a tiny latent issue that was masked by the semantics. Now the test asserts that the event actually happened (semaphore was acquired). (The timeout is still here to prevent the test from hanging forever, and to detect really slow response.) The timeout is increased to a second to allow plenty of time anyway.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T13:58:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T13:26:11Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T16:12:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65647fd93c550c2fc54b955f362618cd1a2126d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dac72054fcf95eadd0a54210e2df9efc9ac74507","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-13823.3","ref":"SPARK-13823.3","sha":"dac72054fcf95eadd0a54210e2df9efc9ac74507","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen function 'executorLost' is invoked in class 'TaskSetManager', it's significant to judge whether variable 'isZombie' is set to true.\n\nThis pull request fixes the following hang:\n1. Open speculation switch in the application. \n2. Run this app and suppose last task of shuffleMapStage 1 finishes. Let's get the record straight, from the eyes of DAG, this stage really finishes, and from the eyes of TaskSetManager, variable 'isZombie' is set to true, but variable runningTasksSet isn't empty because of speculation.\n3. Suddenly, executor 3 is lost. TaskScheduler receiving this signal, invokes all executorLost functions of rootPool's taskSetManagers. DAG receiving this signal, removes all this executor's outputLocs.\n4. TaskSetManager adds all this executor's tasks to pendingTasks and tells DAG they will be resubmitted (Attention: possibly not on time).\n5. DAG starts to submit a new waitingStage, let's say shuffleMapStage 2, and going to find that shuffleMapStage 1 is its missing parent because some outputLocs are removed due to executor lost. Then DAG submits shuffleMapStage 1 again.\n6. DAG still receives Task 'Resubmitted' signal from old taskSetManager, and increases the number of pendingTasks of shuffleMapStage 1 each time. However, old taskSetManager won't resolve new task to submit because its variable 'isZombie' is set to true.\n7.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, there is no way to control the behaviour when fails to parse corrupt records in JSON data source .\n\nThis PR adds the support for parse modes just like CSV data source. There are three modes below:\n- `PERMISSIVE` :  When it fails to parse, this sets `null` to to field. This is a default mode when it has been this mode.\n- `DROPMALFORMED`: When it fails to parse, this drops the whole record.\n- `FAILFAST`: When it fails to parse, it just throws an exception.\n\nThis PR also make JSON data source share the `ParseModes` in CSV data source.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were used and `./dev/run_tests` for code style tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T06:43:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:30Z","closed_at":"2016-03-21T07:44:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22f46fbb3e6ae020914aeff784cdb520c6a081ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dec3d8167c862385a489b999feb7af6c03316cfa","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-13764","ref":"SPARK-13764","sha":"dec3d8167c862385a489b999feb7af6c03316cfa","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

ClassTags are available when constructing ShuffledRDD we can use them to automatically use Kryo for shuffle serialization when the RDD's types are known to be compatible with Kryo.\n\nThis patch introduces `SerializerManager`, a component which picks the \"best\" serializer for a shuffle given the elements' ClassTags. It will automatically pick a Kryo serializer for ShuffledRDDs whose key, value, and/or combiner types are primitives, arrays of primitives, or strings. In the future we can use this class as a narrow extension point to integrate specialized serializers for other types, such as ByteBuffers.\n\nIn a planned followup patch, I will extend the BlockManager APIs so that we're able to use similar automatic serializer selection when caching RDDs (this is a little trickier because the ClassTags need to be threaded through many more places).\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T06:27:34Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T06:07:19Z","closed_at":"2016-03-17T05:54:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ece8c183ea4a9cdbd01c48ff64adbc2a5a59dd37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45b0c0be3791e518f0a8783951ad9b9e53196a1e","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:automatically-pick-best-serializer","ref":"automatically-pick-best-serializer","sha":"45b0c0be3791e518f0a8783951ad9b9e53196a1e","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere is a feature of hive SQL called multi-insert. For example:\n\n```\nFROM src\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest1\nSELECT key + 1\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest2\nSELECT key WHERE key > 2\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest3\nSELECT col EXPLODE(arr) exp AS col\n...\n```\n\nWe partially support it currently, with some limitations: 1) WHERE can't reference columns produced by LATERAL VIEW. 2) It's not executed eagerly, i.e. `sql(\"...multi-insert clause...\")` won't take place right away like other commands, e.g. CREATE TABLE.\n\nThis PR removes these limitations and make us fully support multi-insert.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2400 added the support to parse JSON rows wrapped with an array.

below:\n\n``` scala\nval schema =\n  StructType(\n    StructField(\"a\", StructType(\n      StructField(\"b\", StringType) :: Nil\n    )) :: Nil)\n```\n- **Before**\n\n```

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs part of the effort to merge `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`, this patch implements an internal catalog called `SessionCatalog` that handles temporary functions and tables and delegates metastore operations to `ExternalCatalog`. Currently, this is still dead code, but in the future it will be part of `SessionState` and will replace `o.a.s.sql.catalyst.analysis.Catalog`.\n\nA recent patch #11573 parses Hive commands ourselves in Spark, but still passes the entire query text to Hive. In a future patch, we will use `SessionCatalog` to implement the parsed commands.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n800+ lines of tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt's common for many SQL operators to not care about reading `null` values for correctness. Currently, this is achieved by performing `isNotNull` checks (for all relevant columns) on a per-row basis. Pushing these null filters in the vectorized parquet reader should bring considerable benefits (especially for cases when the underlying data doesn't contain any nulls or contains all nulls).\n## How

patch modifies the BlockManager, MemoryStore, and several other storage components so that serialized cached blocks are stored as multiple small chunks rather than as a single contiguous ByteBuffer.\n\nThis change will help to improve the efficiency of memory allocation and the accuracy of memory accounting when serializing blocks. Our current serialization code uses a ByteBufferOutputStream, which doubles and re-allocates its backing byte array; this increases the peak memory requirements during serialization (since we need to hold extra memory while expanding the array). In addition, we currently don't account for the extra wasted space at the end of the ByteBuffer's backing array, so a 129 megabyte serialized block may actually consume 256 megabytes of memory. After switching to storing blocks in multiple chunks, we'll be able to efficiently trim the backing buffers so that no space is wasted.\n\nThis change is also a prerequisite to being able to cache blocks which are larger than 2GB (although full support for that depends on several other changes which have not bee implemented yet).\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T00:52:00Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T10:48:30Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T03:03:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f20dd51db725de0dc0d16d68cdfad4574911e345","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2970932bf11ab9cfc8cac33c05a13912ddb345d4","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:chunked-block-serialization","ref":"chunked-block-serialization","sha":"2970932bf11ab9cfc8cac33c05a13912ddb345d4","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded shutdown hook to DriverRunner to kill the driver process in case the Worker JVM exits suddenly and the `WorkerWatcher` was unable to properly catch this.  Did some cleanup to consolidate driver state management and setting of finalized vars within the running thread.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests to verify that final state and exception variables are set accordingly for successfull, failed, and errors in the driver process.  Retrofitted existing test to verify killing of mocked process ends with the correct state and stops properly\n\nManually tested (with deploy-mode=cluster) that the shutdown hook is called by forcibly exiting the `Worker` and various points in the code with the `WorkerWatcher` both disabled and enabled.  Also, manually killed the driver through the ui and verified that the `DriverRunner` interrupted, killed the process and exited properly.\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T00:25:46Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T17:57:33Z","closed_at":"2016-08-11T21:51:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9cf20b1f16e1b20d0e47a92f901cbad20767876","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d8f4f6ef7e73fab0a6955a25eee30b0df49d5a6","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:DriverRunner-shutdown-hook-SPARK-13602","ref":"DriverRunner-shutdown-hook-SPARK-13602","sha":"6d8f4f6ef7e73fab0a6955a25eee30b0df49d5a6","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11682. \n\nNow, `ColumnPruning` and `PushPredicateThroughProject` reverse each other's effect. Although it will not cause the max iteration now, some queries are not optimized to the best. \n\nFor example, in the following query, \n\n``` scala\n    val input = LocalRelation('a.int, 'b.string, 'c.double, 'd.int)\n    val originalQuery =\n      input.select('a, 'b, 'c, 'd,\n        WindowExpression(\n          AggregateExpression(Count('b), Complete, isDistinct = false),\n          WindowSpecDefinition( 'a :: Nil,\n            SortOrder('b, Ascending) :: Nil,\n            UnspecifiedFrame)).as('window)).where('window > 1).select('a, 'c)\n```\n\nAfter multiple iteration of two rules of `ColumnPruning` and `PushPredicateThroughProject`, the optimized plan we generated is like:\n\n```\nProject [a#0,c#0]                                                                                                                                                                    \n+- Filter (window#0L > cast(1 as bigint))                                                                                                                                            \n   +- Project [a#0,c#0,window#0L]                                                                                                                                                    \n      +- Window [(count(b#0),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) windowspecdefinition(a#0, b#0 ASC, RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS window#0L], [a#0], [b#0 ASC]   \n         +- LocalRelation [a#0,b#0,c#0,d#0]                                                                                                                                          \n```\n\nHowever, the expected optimized plan should be like:\n\n```\nProject [a#0,c#0]\n+- Filter (window#0L > cast(1 as bigint))\n   +- Project [a#0,c#0,window#0L]\n      +- Window [(count(b#0),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) windowspecdefinition(a#0, b#0 ASC, RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS window#0L], [a#0], [b#0 ASC]\n         +- Project [a#0,b#0,c#0]\n            +- LocalRelation [a#0,b#0,c#0,d#0]                                                                                                                                          \n```\n\nThe solution of this PR is to split the rule `ColumnPruning` into two parts: `PushProjectThroughFilter` and `ColumnPruning`. The new rule `PushProjectThroughPredicate` runs before starting `ColumnPruning`. This PR also moves the rule `PushPredicateThroughProject` before the rules `SetOperationPushDown` and `PushPredicateThroughJoin` to ensure all the predicates can be pushed before `PushProjectThroughFilter` reverses the effect of the rule `PushPredicateThroughProject`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases already expose the problem, but we need to add more regression tests to ensure the future code changes will not break it. \n\nTODO: add more test cases.\nWill submit another PR for stopping pushing `Project` through the other operators in `ColumnPruning` if it contains non-deterministic expressions.\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T00:23:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T16:07:08Z","closed_at":"2016-03-25T16:07:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"73745570214c79c4c3754e53ba0be396b0f6480b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b853e01a281c575ccbf5e312840b749fd479fe69","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:predicatePushDownOverColumnPruning","ref":"predicatePushDownOverColumnPruning","sha":"b853e01a281c575ccbf5e312840b749fd479fe69","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse.runtimeMirror(Ljava/lang/ClassLoader;)Lscala/reflect/api/JavaMirrors$JavaMirror;\n```\n\nThis PR replace the existing `test.jar` with `test-2.10.jar` and `test-2.11.jar` and improve the regression test to use the suitable jar file.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the existing Jenkins test.\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T00:06:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T05:28:11Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T09:07:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7293a5ff8521b1b135012c0597623fdb75b53c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38b97523e84c6c25565b37f9dd120bd01f74a87d","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-12653","ref":"SPARK-12653","sha":"38b97523e84c6c25565b37f9dd120bd01f74a87d","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"643649dcbfabc5d6952c2ecfb98286324c887665","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWholeStageCodegen naturally breaks the execution into pipelines that are easier to\nmeasure duration.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe need to copy the UnsafeRow since a Join could produce multiple rows from single input rows. We could avoid that if there is no join (or the join will not produce multiple rows) inside WholeStageCodegen.\n\nUpdated the benchmark for `collect`, we could see 20-30% speedup.\n## How was this
