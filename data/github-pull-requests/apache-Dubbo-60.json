Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T06:16:23Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T05:54:56Z","closed_at":"2019-08-12T06:27:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e15b9d8fa848ec09c2e1310b6e3c82b691403dda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e32af55c9b09c5984519d1d48a52d64a00f7f786","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:getEncodedServiceKey","ref":"getEncodedServiceKey","sha":"e32af55c9b09c5984519d1d48a52d64a00f7f786","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nci\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T02:46:12Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T04:57:50Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T04:57:50Z","merged_at":"2019-05-31T04:57:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"7f7a28987853aa511ba18ab3647c34187e88230f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/34142e5686848c9600338bf60dff9706f0399bcc","head":{"label":"sofkyle:master","ref":"master","sha":"34142e5686848c9600338bf60dff9706f0399bcc","user":{"login":"sofkyle","id":7426860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MjY4NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7426860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle","html_url":"https://github.com/sofkyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sofkyle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4b97a0ba8b5edcedb37a320e00cd5bc36f304f90","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd jenkinsfile for dubbo snapshot deployment\r\n\r\nCurrently existing job is configured by web ui, but it's better to use Jenkinsfile to make configuration more easy to modify. More information about Jenkinsfile, refer to https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe jenkins job every trigger by two conditions:\r\n+ every two hour check git repo update, if it has new commit, will start\r\n+ every 12 hours will run without commit check (in case first rule trigger build but travis still pending)\r\n\r\nThis job will do following step\r\n+ check if current commit already deployed\r\n+ check current commit status is pass (depends on travis CI result)\r\n+ check current project is using snapshot version\r\n+ do snapshot deployment\r\n+ save current commit id\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/Apache%20Dubbo/job/apache-dubbo-snapshot-deployment/\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T06:04:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T06:07:05Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T06:07:05Z","merged_at":"2019-05-30T06:07:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"25102686bccbb00bd74a9273b3ec39c3e052d56f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/30824e688209686755828c945bb9bb4deb676a73","head":{"label":"uglycow:2.7.2-release","ref":"2.7.2-release","sha":"30824e688209686755828c945bb9bb4deb676a73","user":{"login":"uglycow","id":7302803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDI4MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7302803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow","html_url":"https://github.com/uglycow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189335771,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkzMzU3NzE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"uglycow/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uglycow","id":7302803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDI4MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7302803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow","html_url":"https://github.com/uglycow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uglycow/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T04:54:09Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T03:12:58Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T03:12:58Z","merged_at":"2019-05-31T03:12:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ab26b170b40f146707cdab0b4436e32df4f5e9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/046174fb92e70457b7e3c240bd5e2aa04e8eb859","head":{"label":"ralf0131:dubbo-4200","ref":"dubbo-4200","sha":"046174fb92e70457b7e3c240bd5e2aa04e8eb859","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove license check script\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Fix unexpected file like `license-list.txt-e` generated by sed, make sure it works both under MacOS and Linux.\r\n2. Add some library to white list, some of the licenses are tricky to decide whether it is compatible because of the versions, so I add the library to white list.\r\n3. remove the extra new lines generated, make it clearer.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPassed my local test.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-29T05:48:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T02:39:57Z","closed_at":"2019-08-04T02:39:51Z","merged_at":"2019-08-04T02:39:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"9bf51e5ec1c41a7febfad3fc28579237e849be9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/22f2409071a8ca327932904f192b515851c28b3e","head":{"label":"ralf0131:improve-license-check-script","ref":"improve-license-check-script","sha":"22f2409071a8ca327932904f192b515851c28b3e","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-28T07:00:07Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T11:01:16Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T11:01:15Z","merged_at":"2019-05-28T11:01:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae1e3bd6a999c79a43f3c6fb9973b303507db7a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/159c567bd44ae7765f5ef0a5d2ae4d9b97d12a01","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue3137","ref":"issue3137","sha":"159c567bd44ae7765f5ef0a5d2ae4d9b97d12a01","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.7.2-release","ref":"2.7.2-release","sha":"3dd261a4362332533dbc5fcac12151c8e334c362","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-28T02:15:02Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T02:24:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T02:24:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6ac851fad12d144942fc2917f810867065c7fc5e","head":{"label":"uglycow:master","ref":"master","sha":"6ac851fad12d144942fc2917f810867065c7fc5e","user":{"login":"uglycow","id":7302803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDI4MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7302803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow","html_url":"https://github.com/uglycow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uglycow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3dd261a4362332533dbc5fcac12151c8e334c362","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

name，改用新的字段CONSUMER_APPLICATION_KEY","created_at":"2019-05-27T15:27:23Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T08:58:16Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T08:58:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95d9625bcfcb34ea498286658caad42bad8e9a07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/30adef3130f85020f2acc8c35c41bb09efee1cc7","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:application-name-newest","ref":"application-name-newest","sha":"30adef3130f85020f2acc8c35c41bb09efee1cc7","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-27T09:03:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-13T07:45:57Z","closed_at":"2021-03-13T07:45:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-27T03:40:48Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T08:43:03Z","closed_at":"2019-05-27T08:42:11Z","merged_at":"2019-05-27T08:42:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"18eb69e96475c05be9bb8b5d7a0c7bcdafa97405","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bcdf22395543e131cf76645f53395b360afe6030","head":{"label":"chickenlj:solve-compile-problem-in-java11","ref":"solve-compile-problem-in-java11","sha":"bcdf22395543e131cf76645f53395b360afe6030","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/3816 some problem.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. The name of RpcContext#remoteApplicationName is not very accurate, it will make people think that it is the application of the provider when the consumer calls the provider.\r\n\r\n2.The application name of the consumer is no longer passed through REMOTE_APPLICATION_KEY, because REMOTE_APPLICATION_KEY is used in the routing label, referring to the application name of the provider, using the new field CONSUMER_APPLICATION_KEY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. 之前RpcContext#remoteApplicationName的名称不太准确，会让人误以为是consumer调用provider时，provider的application。所以优化成RpcContext#consumerApplicationName。\r\n\r\n2.不再通过REMOTE_APPLICATION_KEY来传递consumer的application name，因为REMOTE_APPLICATION_KEY在路由标签中有使用，指的是provider的application name，改用新的字段CONSUMER_APPLICATION_KEY\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-27T02:44:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T14:36:33Z","closed_at":"2019-05-27T14:36:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5702619be40dfa51130614dbf62b7ccd60e47e22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2c9a30f57bc938799d6e2acc75c3075b7e7c62ff","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:applicationname-new","ref":"applicationname-new","sha":"2c9a30f57bc938799d6e2acc75c3075b7e7c62ff","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168960913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5NjA5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"manzhizhen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-27T02:22:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-27T09:33:29Z","closed_at":"2019-05-27T09:32:37Z","merged_at":"2019-05-27T09:32:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"3dd261a4362332533dbc5fcac12151c8e334c362","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0b8d6a5e94a984e338f51ca43e38343faab7d9db","head":{"label":"ralf0131:dubbo-4147","ref":"dubbo-4147","sha":"0b8d6a5e94a984e338f51ca43e38343faab7d9db","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-25T02:05:53Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T07:10:47Z","closed_at":"2019-08-12T07:10:46Z","merged_at":"2019-08-12T07:10:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"897709b57c0a5edae3b3a1439d42116ea63df5b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4163/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4163/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4163/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9c7e29522c78913e7ff6255e557c32c1a58d3f69","head":{"label":"kexianjun:fix-4160","ref":"fix-4160","sha":"9c7e29522c78913e7ff6255e557c32c1a58d3f69","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145399297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUzOTkyOTc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kexianjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T09:49:34Z","updated_at":"2019-05-25T04:35:43Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T23:18:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78494c3b33442cfeb9e20b0962c03845e51ef1e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f6796478a8fe354f394a8eecd42bd385244129d2","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:subscribeTo","ref":"subscribeTo","sha":"f6796478a8fe354f394a8eecd42bd385244129d2","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\ndubbo-rpc-jsonrpc\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nunit-test\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-24T08:52:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T09:01:29Z","closed_at":"2019-09-09T09:01:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ebce9e74eac912d40cb2c0ef2b27c5e202e8dad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3c39a82cf4f4a48cd3b3d4774d4afe00166a7ab8","head":{"label":"imsunv:feature_transfer_attachment_jsonrpc","ref":"feature_transfer_attachment_jsonrpc","sha":"3c39a82cf4f4a48cd3b3d4774d4afe00166a7ab8","user":{"login":"imsunv","id":34081506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDgxNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34081506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv","html_url":"https://github.com/imsunv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112415301,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTI0MTUzMDE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"imsunv/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imsunv","id":34081506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDgxNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34081506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv","html_url":"https://github.com/imsunv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsunv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imsunv/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T12:45:25Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T16:16:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T16:16:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/58c147410f284711bf2d350d79e2f8f7bd360b5e","head":{"label":"apache:3.x-dev","ref":"3.x-dev","sha":"58c147410f284711bf2d350d79e2f8f7bd360b5e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nThe test case in the commit verifies the change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [X] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [X] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T11:25:56Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T08:49:28Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T08:49:28Z","merged_at":"2021-04-11T08:49:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"4dee63530ca7502792e073a989c66a0e8fc74e01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ce34941dd096c99ad4d46b98bcd5d168ef1c6ecd","head":{"label":"leonliao:bugfix_4140","ref":"bugfix_4140","sha":"ce34941dd096c99ad4d46b98bcd5d168ef1c6ecd","user":{"login":"leonliao","id":837597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao","html_url":"https://github.com/leonliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187985376,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5ODUzNzY=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"leonliao/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leonliao","id":837597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzU5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao","html_url":"https://github.com/leonliao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonliao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leonliao/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nmanually merge #4085 and #4087\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T05:18:00Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T07:30:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-23T07:30:46Z","merged_at":"2019-05-23T07:30:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a66206e5ed3086fc52fab57263b4afe4b6ad8d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cc170ae52f1fe77d9a7c9b74ed9f24f4b9f9e8b7","head":{"label":"chickenlj:cherry-pick-DefaultFuture-from-3.x","ref":"cherry-pick-DefaultFuture-from-3.x","sha":"cc170ae52f1fe77d9a7c9b74ed9f24f4b9f9e8b7","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T04:52:43Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T04:20:24Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T04:20:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f2a22e71271ef68f36f67b5e032f30094496d93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/20/labels","id":3507969,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzUwNzk2OQ==","number":20,"title":"3.0.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":1,"closed_issues":19,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-07-19T02:18:35Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T13:20:45Z","due_on":"2021-07-10T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-08-06T07:53:19Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/57fb3c3190a484cd4645f1da548b5e1ed8c6a9cf","head":{"label":"chickenlj:thenApplyWithContext-3.x","ref":"thenApplyWithContext-3.x","sha":"57fb3c3190a484cd4645f1da548b5e1ed8c6a9cf","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T03:43:02Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T07:24:17Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T06:49:26Z","merged_at":"2019-05-24T06:49:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"92cafe962d8fd3df034c16629954425f4640f343","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a65dad84875208e31547240f2d1565a582e5b9bc","head":{"label":"chickenlj:thenApplyWithContext-2.7","ref":"thenApplyWithContext-2.7","sha":"a65dad84875208e31547240f2d1565a582e5b9bc","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T02:51:41Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T03:20:12Z","closed_at":"2019-05-23T03:20:12Z","merged_at":"2019-05-23T03:20:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"5285952a2ab80780133b4f9b1a9bb308ac9978a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4eca5fd4177af28e7518bee04e56de59e7a85cda","head":{"label":"cvictory:issue_3866","ref":"issue_3866","sha":"4eca5fd4177af28e7518bee04e56de59e7a85cda","user":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126129533,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjYxMjk1MzM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cvictory/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-17T10:00:42Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T09:24:35Z","closed_at":"2019-05-18T01:05:42Z","merged_at":"2019-05-18T01:05:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"13f32380f85778826a3deef93a517bf781f126cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/25/labels","id":4111000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDExMTAwMA==","number":25,"title":"2.7.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":115,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-03-05T06:44:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T07:15:12Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c26477e8f9488307cb1a7599511255f4c157b8eb","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/comment","ref":"feature/comment","sha":"c26477e8f9488307cb1a7599511255f4c157b8eb","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-17T09:49:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T13:19:32Z","closed_at":"2019-06-20T13:19:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"216543cc942caa75bcb3e8067f36a307dc48cfd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/732f7d1358f1605668967f98056f5cfa3f577ae6","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:ut/etcd","ref":"ut/etcd","sha":"732f7d1358f1605668967f98056f5cfa3f577ae6","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-16T09:37:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-28T05:06:38Z","closed_at":"2019-06-27T06:53:02Z","merged_at":"2019-06-27T06:53:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a9ddd866658f6ccae056e14face4152551de17e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/26/labels","id":4307099,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDMwNzA5OQ==","number":26,"title":"2.7.3","description":"1.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-16T08:10:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T10:13:07Z","closed_at":"2019-05-16T09:25:14Z","merged_at":"2019-05-16T09:25:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"228cad5ef439b7db6fe62566dcd158ce0a127b4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5d90ace05bb0d6b7e202edcbba3db7001d7b868d","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue3137","ref":"issue3137","sha":"5d90ace05bb0d6b7e202edcbba3db7001d7b868d","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1798fed5c2a33908b5997e7733095354c2d19ab4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-14T05:58:40Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T08:14:40Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T08:12:31Z","merged_at":"2019-05-14T08:12:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b380e32807e51ad9f6b61f27556915a184f9681","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5f1c36b3e04e5ddc12b197481c91751d69655f69","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue3137","ref":"issue3137","sha":"5f1c36b3e04e5ddc12b197481c91751d69655f69","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d24d61401b4d504ba1267e26e26dc575b0080e2b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-13T14:58:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T15:44:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-13T15:43:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88672b71f933ad00ef260929abf93ce3e200b0c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nissue #3137: step3 - start to use ClusterConstants and MonitorConstants \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-13T13:14:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T02:02:11Z","closed_at":"2019-05-13T15:54:46Z","merged_at":"2019-05-13T15:54:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"175eab1b83e90d0d95961d38d4713a7add82ad48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4045/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/4045/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/4045/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dab0bdb90f829e455eb04ea40309554e005b3416","head":{"label":"beiwei30:issue3137","ref":"issue3137","sha":"dab0bdb90f829e455eb04ea40309554e005b3416","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e69086400c188154bd1ac9592df2f7a077d08769","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
