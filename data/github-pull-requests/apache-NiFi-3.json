Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13990](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13990) - CLI - pg-enable-services will fail if parent PG has disabled CS\r\n\r\nScenario:\r\n- root process group\r\n  - has a disabled controller service\r\n  - has a process group PG1\r\n- PG1\r\n  - has multiple controller services\r\n\r\nIf using pg-enable-services on PG1, it will always fail because it'll check the listed controller services at PG1 level which also includes controller services from parent process groups although the request to enable controller services will not enable controller services in parent process groups.\r\n\r\nWhen checking controller service states, it should filter the list of controller services with the ones defined at the level of the specified process group.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13982](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13982) - Web client - body as string and get request URI for response entity\r\n\r\nIn the web client API, we currently have in `HttpRequestBodySpec`:\r\n\r\n````java\r\nHttpRequestHeadersSpec body(InputStream inputStream, OptionalLong contentLength) \r\n````\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient to also have:\r\n\r\n````java\r\nHttpRequestHeadersSpec body(String body); \r\n````\r\n\r\nEspecially when the payload is very small and easy to craft.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in `HttpResponseEntity`, there is no way to know what endpoint has been accessed to generate that response. Having the possibility to retrieved the requested endpoint from the response entity might be useful when there is a separation between processors and controller services, in particular when generating the provenance events at processor level where adding the transit URI is useful for data lineage.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13978](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13978) Improves the performance of Record Date Time parsing in the converter for `LocalDateTime` objects.\r\n\r\nThe implementation replaces the `DateTimeFormatter.parseBest()` method with a custom `TemporalQuery` that checks for the existence of a `ZoneId` in the parsed `TemporalAccessor`. This approach avoids the try-catch loop in the `parseBest()` method.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Original behavior where the provider lists all secrets and matches them to `Secret Name Pattern` is preserved by leaving `Secret Name` parameter undefined. The new behavior will skip listing secrets and ignore `Secret Name Pattern` only if `Secret Name` is provided.  I made this change in [Anetac's Nifi fork](https://github.com/Eng-Anetac/nifi) months ago and we are using it in production.\r\n\r\nCorresponding PR for 1.x branch:

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13950](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13950) - NiFi CLI - add commands to list branch, bucket, flows, versions through NiFi for Registry Clients\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CLI only provides access to branches / buckets / flows and versions via the use of `cli.sh registry ...` which only works when using the NiFi Registry.\r\n\r\nNow that Registry Client is an extension point and that we have additional implementations, we should provide CLI commands to provide read-only access through a given registry client for listing branches / buckets / flows and versions. This will help users when they want to import a given flow with `cli.sh nifi pg-import ...`. In particular when it relates to versions because, when using a GitHub Registry Client, the version is a commit ID and it might not always be easy to retrieve / provide.\r\n\r\n````\r\n./bin/cli.sh

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13938](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13938) Removes Iceberg Processors and Services under the `nifi-iceberg-bundle` module based on discussions related to tightly coupled dependencies for Hive 3, and current class loading strategies for Kerberos, described in [NIFI-13934](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13934) and the related pull request for removing the Hive 3 Catalog Service.\r\n\r\nWith Hive 3 declared end of life on 8 October 2024, new versions of NiFi should not ship these components. Removing the existing implementation provides the opportunity for a different approach that avoids tight coupling to particular Iceberg Catalog implementations. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13936](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13936) - Remove GCP PubSub Lite components\r\n\r\nPub/Sub Lite is deprecated. Effective March 18, 2026, Pub/Sub Lite will be turned down.\r\n\r\nCurrent customers: Pub/Sub Lite remains functional until March 18, 2026. If you have not used Pub/Sub Lite within the 90-day period preceding September 24, 2024 (June 26, 2024 - September 24, 2024), you won't be able to access Pub/Sub Lite starting on September 24, 2024.\r\nNew customers: Pub/Sub Lite is no longer available for new customers after September 24, 2024.\r\nSee - https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/docs/migrate-pubsub-lite-to-pubsub\r\n\r\nGiven the upcoming 2.0 release, it's better to just remove the components. If needed by someone, they can still download the NAR from 2.0-M4 to get these specific processors.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13935](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13935) Removes HBase 2 Processors and Services along with the optional `include-hbase` profile.\r\n\r\nHBase components are not part of the convenience binary build and HBase 2 is tightly coupled to Protobuf Java 2.5.0, which has multiple associated vulnerabilities.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13934](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13934) Removes the Hive 3 Catalog implementation from Iceberg services due to the Apache Hive project declaring Hive 3 end of life on [8 October 2024](https://hive.apache.org/general/downloads/). Removing Hive 3 dependencies removes several flagged vulnerabilities associated with `libthrift` 0.9.3 and also avoids potential issues due to lack of future updates for Hive 3.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13931](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13931) Updates the guide links in the project README.md to use `nifi-latest` instead of a referencing a particular version. This aligns with the addition of a [RewriteRule](https://github.com/apache/nifi-site/commit/f16e925d97e9b2b57670d3e5e12f44ba7ca7009b) in the `nifi-site` project.

and added it to the DataflowTriggerContext. This was necessary because the previous design overlooked the possibility of many threads concurrently running the same dataflow. They all shared the same StatelessProvenanceRepository, but the code was designed as if only a single thread would be using the repository. As a result, the events that were registered with the stateless prov repo were being copied many times into NiFi's underlying provenance repository. This refactoring also led to the discovery of some old Java 8 syntax that could be cleaned up, and it led to the discovery of some methods that were no longer being used and could be cleaned up. Finally, in testing, I found that when a Stateless Group was scheduled, it scheduled the triggering of the stateless group before marking the state as RUNNING; as a result, the second thread could run, determine that the state is STARTING instead of RUNNING, and return without triggering the stateless group. This was addressed by ensuring that we set the state to RUNNING before triggering the stateless group to be triggered.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13927](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13927) - PublishGCPPubSub processor stop working and is stucked when using Record Oriented mode\r\n\r\nIn `org.apache.nifi.processors.gcp.pubsub.publish.FlowFileResult.reconcile()` (https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-extension-bundles/nifi-gcp-bundle/nifi-gcp-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/gcp/pubsub/publish/FlowFileResult.java#L60), we can be in a case where \r\n````java\r\nwhile (futures.size() > (successes.size() + failures.size()))\r\n````\r\nwill never be true.\r\n\r\nIt means that, for a reason I didn't identify, `TrackedApiFutureCallback` is not always going into the callback `onSuccess`  or that the `successes` list is not updated as it should. For example, when I'm stuck in the while loop, I have `futures.size() = 2500`, `successes.size() = 2495`, `failures.size() = 0`, and I can confirm that I'm able to consume 2500 messages so all messages have been properly published while the flowfile is stuck in the Publish processor.\r\n\r\nThe feeling is that the approach can be refactored to not rely on the callback but instead directly check the futures once they all completed and check one by one what is the status (ie. is there a message ID or a throwable?).\r\n\r\n````java\r\ntry {\r\n    ApiFutures.allAsList(futures).get();\r\n} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {\r\n    logger.error(\"Failed to reconcile PubSub send operation status\", e);\r\n}\r\n// we now know that all futures have completed\r\n// we go over all futures to see if we have the message ID (which means this is a success)\r\n// and we can see if some futures threw exception to deal with failures\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the code by taking this approach. Some of the code changes have been made to support existing unit tests without too much refactoring in the unit tests. Besides, the changes have been tested with the flow definition provided in the JIRA as well as in more advanced scenarios (different batch sizes, concurrent tasks, etc) and everything seems to be working well.\r\n\r\nThe logging has also been slightly changed to properly report bulletins at processor level when a flow file is sent into the failure and/or retry relationships.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13924](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13924) - NiFi CLI - delete-param has no effect\r\n\r\nWhile doing some testing for [NIFI-13904](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13904), I noticed that the delete-param CLI command has no effect. After some digging, this is due to [NIFI-12898](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12898) and the addition of asset support. In the CLI, the referenced asset needs to set to null to let the backend know that this is a deletion request.\r\n\r\nSee:

This enhancement introduces a new boolean property `Include Deleted Records` that allows users to include deleted records in their queries. When enabled, the processor automatically includes the `IsDeleted` field in the SELECT clause and utilizes the `queryAll` Salesforce API endpoint to retrieve both active and deleted records. This functionality is essential for scenarios requiring audit trails, compliance tracking, and monitoring record deletions.\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n- **New Property Added:**\r\n  - `Include Deleted Records` (Boolean): Enables the inclusion of deleted records in Salesforce queries.\r\n  \r\n- **Query Modification:**\r\n  - When `Include Deleted Records` is set to `true`, the `IsDeleted` field is added to the SELECT statement if not already present.\r\n  - The processor switches from using the `/query` endpoint to the `/queryAll` endpoint to fetch both active and deleted records.\r\n  \r\n- **SalesforceRestClient Updates:**\r\n  - Added a new method `queryAll(String query)` to support the `/queryAll` API endpoint.\r\n  \r\n- **Backward Compatibility:**\r\n  - The default behavior remains unchanged (`Include Deleted Records` is `false`), ensuring existing workflows are not disrupted unless explicitly enabled.\r\n  \r\n- **State Management:**\r\n  - Updated state reset logic to account for changes in the `Include Deleted Records` property, ensuring consistent behavior upon property modifications.\r\n  \r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - Updated processor annotations and descriptions to reflect the new functionality and guide users on utilizing the `Include Deleted Records` property.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement allows users to effectively track and manage deleted records within their Salesforce integrations, aligning with audit and compliance requirements without affecting existing data retrieval processes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13904](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13904) - Linking Parameter Contexts using NiFi Toolkit causes sensitive parameters to become invalid\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the CLI for setting / removing the parameter context inheritance is broken when the parameter context to update contains sensitive parameters. The reason is that, currently, the update parameter request is adding all of the parameter entities in the request. However, when we retrieve sensitive parameters, we never really retrieve the sensitive values on the client side, we only get `*****` strings. Because of this, the current update request is actually updating the values of the sensitive parameters to this  `*****` value and this is what makes referencing components invalid. The update request needs to be updated so that the value of the sensitive parameters is explicitly set to `null` so that the backend knows that the sensitive parameters are not changed by this update request.\r\n\r\nThis pull request also slightly improves the display output of parameters retrieved via a parameter provider. I'm happy to put this into a separate PR if we think this is better. While reproducing the issue, I noticed that the command to fetch parameters from a parameter provider is not giving information about the created parameter contexts so this additional information can be useful and removes the need for listing parameter contexts.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n````\r\n./bin/cli.sh nifi fetch-params -p nifi-cli.properties -ppid b56a9960-0192-1000-b4f7-33908ea4027f

This enhancement introduces a new boolean property `Include Deleted Records` that allows users to include deleted records in their queries. When enabled, the processor automatically includes the `IsDeleted` field in the SELECT clause and utilizes the `queryAll` Salesforce API endpoint to retrieve both active and deleted records. This functionality is essential for scenarios requiring audit trails, compliance tracking, and monitoring record deletions.\r\n\r\n**Key Changes:**\r\n- **New Property Added:**\r\n  - `Include Deleted Records` (Boolean): Enables the inclusion of deleted records in Salesforce queries.\r\n  \r\n- **Query Modification:**\r\n  - When `Include Deleted Records` is set to `true`, the `IsDeleted` field is added to the SELECT statement if not already present.\r\n  - The processor switches from using the `/query` endpoint to the `/queryAll` endpoint to fetch both active and deleted records.\r\n  \r\n- **SalesforceRestClient Updates:**\r\n  - Added a new method `queryAll(String query)` to support the `/queryAll` API endpoint.\r\n  \r\n- **Backward Compatibility:**\r\n  - The default behavior remains unchanged (`Include Deleted Records` is `false`), ensuring existing workflows are not disrupted unless explicitly enabled.\r\n  \r\n- **State Management:**\r\n  - Updated state reset logic to account for changes in the `Include Deleted Records` property, ensuring consistent behavior upon property modifications.\r\n  \r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - Updated processor annotations and descriptions to reflect the new functionality and guide users on utilizing the `Include Deleted Records` property.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement allows users to effectively track and manage deleted records within their Salesforce integrations, aligning with audit and compliance requirements without affecting existing data retrieval processes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13909](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13909) Updates and simplifies the primary project `README.md` with additional badges and streamlined command examples.\r\n\r\nAdditional badges include the following:\r\n\r\n- `nifi-api` link to Maven Central\r\n- `javadoc` link to Javadocs for `nifi-api` with latest version\r\n- `license` indicator with `Apache-2.0` based on GitHub project `LICENSE` declaration\r\n- `issues` link to Apache Jira\r\n- `contact` links to `Developers` and `Users` mailing lists\r\n- `follow` link to LinkedIn page\r\n- `follow` link to X\r\n\r\nMany of the badges include logo icons, and project colors in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe refreshed `Features` section highlights Python Processors and single sign-on, among others.\r\n\r\nInstead of including separate build information for MiNiFi and Registry, the new `Projects` section has links to the `README.md` files for these projects.\r\n\r\nThe `Developing` and `Running` sections are streamlined to avoid unnecessary directory and version information, retaining the commands to run.\r\n\r\nThe `Documentation` and `Getting Help` sections are removed, now covered under additional project badges.\r\n\r\nThe `Export Control` section retains the previous wording, but contains an updated list of linked libraries and frameworks that provide encrypted communication and storage capabilities.\r\n\r\nViewing the [source branch](https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi/tree/NIFI-13909) for this pull request displays the rendered version of the
