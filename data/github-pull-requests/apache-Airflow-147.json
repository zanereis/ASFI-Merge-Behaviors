an issue that can occur when reattaching to ECS tasks.\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22878\r\n\r\nThe code for fetching AWS logs, looks for the ecs_task_id field. When executing the task for the first time, this is updated after fetching the ARN for the first time. However, when the task is reattached to an existing ECS task, the current code will update the ARN, but will not update the ecs_task_id. The code change will ensure that the ecs_task_id is updated when the ARN is updated at the time of reattaching.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a continuation of

Since we can't know if the user _needs_ to do so or not, we should refuse the temptation to guess either way.\r\n* Timeouts _without_ default answer values are now ignored, instead of constantly and endlessly re-prompting the user.\r\n* Breeze should now explicitly ask for permission before overwriting user config files.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

parameter names for installing airflow from PyPI or\r\ncontext were pretty confusing. This change unifies and\r\nshortens names of the parameters, so that it is easier to\r\nreason about them.\r\n\r\nIf INSTALL_PACKAGES_FROM_CONTEXT is set then the image will\r\ninstall packages from docker-context-files (for airflow and\r\nproviders it will use constraints as if it was a normal\r\nairflow installation).\r\n\r\nBy default Airflow is installed from PyPi or source code\r\ndepending on the installation method, but if you also\r\nset AIRFLOW_IS_IN_CONTEXT = true, it means that Airflow and\r\nproviders are already present in the docker-context-files\r\nand no extra installation of Airlfow and Providers is\r\nperformed from PyPI or sources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
