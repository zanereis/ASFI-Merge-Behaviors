Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-30209 discusses about adding additional metrics such as stageId, attempId and taskId for max metrics. We have the data required to display in LiveStageMetrics. Need to capture and pass these metrics to display on the UI. To minimize memory used for variables, we are saving maximum of each metric id per stage. So per stage additional memory usage is (#metrics * 4 * sizeof(Long)).  \r\nThen max is calculated for each metric id among all stages which is passed in the stringValue method. Memory used is minimal. Ran the benchmark for runtime. Stage.Proc time has increased to around 1.5-2.5x but the Aggregate time has decreased.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese additional metrics stageId, attemptId and taskId could help in debugging the jobs quicker.  For a  given operator, it will be easy to identify the task which is taking maximum time to complete from the SQL tab itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. stageId, attemptId and taskId is shown only for executor side metrics. For driver metrics, \"(driver)\" is displayed on UI.\r\n![image (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50492963/70763041-929d9980-1d07-11ea-940f-88ac6bdce9b5.png)\r\n\r\n\"Driver\"\r\n![image (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50492963/70763043-94675d00-1d07-11ea-95ab-3478728cb435.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested, ran benchmark script for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded `shutdownHook` for shutdown method of executor plugin. This will ensure that shutdown method will be called always.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhenever executors are not going down gracefully, i.e getting killed due to idle time or getting killed forcefully, shutdown method of executors plugin is not getting called. Shutdown method can be used to release any resources that plugin has acquired during its initialisation. So its important to make sure that every time a executor goes down shutdown method of plugin gets called.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested Manually\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd DescribeFunctionsStatement and make DESCRIBE FUNCTIONS go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing\r\nDESCRIBE FUNCTIONS namespace.function\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis changeset already appears in the master branch and on the 2.4 branch. My team hit this issue while using 2.3 (we are in the process of upgrading). I noticed that there was a fairly recent release of the 2.3 branch, I don't know if others are planned, but it looked like a good candidate to backport one more version if there would be any more 2.3.x releases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe mentioned JIRA already describes the issues faced with the bug unaddressed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests all pass, and the tests added in this patch also pass on this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake ```MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel``` extend ```MultilayerPerceptronParams```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake ```MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel``` extend ```MultilayerPerceptronParams``` to expose the training params, so user can see these params when calling ```extractParamMap```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. The ```MultilayerPerceptronParams``` such as ```seed```, ```maxIter``` ... are available in ```MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel``` now\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested ```MultilayerPerceptronClassificationModel.extractParamMap()``` to verify all the new params are there.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for configure pod dns for Kubernetes when submit a job. So that user can specify the dns nameservers, dns searches and dns options.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis's a common scenarios for hybricloud where we use public cloud compute resourses while with specified private dns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. User can specify the dns options when submit a job.\r\nAs a result, we can use the following property to specify the pod dns config.\r\n\r\n- spark.kubernetes.dnsConfig.nameservers, Comma separated list of the Kubernetes dns nameservers for driver and executor.\r\n- spark.kubernetes.dnsConfig.searches, Comma separated list of the Kubernetes dns searches for driver and executor.\r\n- spark.kubernetes.dnsConfig.options.[OptionVariableName], Add the dns option variable specified by OptionVariableName to the Driver And Executor process. The user can specify multiple of these to set multiple options variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test.\r\n\r\nCloses #26834 from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImpl QuantileTransform, a non-parametric transformation to map the data to another\r\ndistribution\r\nThe impl followed scikit-learn' s impl, however there still are sereral differences:\r\n1, use `QuantileSummaries` for approximation, no matter the size of dataset;\r\n2, use linear interpolate, the logic is similar to existing `IsotonicRegression`, while scikit-learn use a bi-directional interpolate (the two methods only differ on a special case that  values are repeated in the features);\r\n3, treat sparse vectors just like dense ones, while scikit-learn have two different logics for sparse and dense datasets.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, it is common to map the data to another desired distribution, and was already impled in scikit-learn\r\n2, it is easy for parallelism\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new model\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNow spark use `ObjectInspectorCopyOption.JAVA` as oi option which will convert any string to UTF-8 string. When write non UTF-8 code data, then `EFBFBD` will appear.\r\nWe should use `ObjectInspectorCopyOption.DEFAULT` to support pass the bytes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHere is the way to reproduce:\r\n1. make a file contains 16 radix 'AABBCC' which is not the UTF-8 code.\r\n2. create table test1 (c string) location '$file_path';\r\n3. select hex(c) from test1; // AABBCC\r\n4. craete table test2 (c string) as select c from test1;\r\n5. select hex(c) from test2; // EFBFBDEFBFBDEFBFBD\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-10T11:17:00Z","updated_at":"2021-03-10T06:10:02Z","closed_at":"2019-12-17T04:16:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1c45ad14fd09fe8f7c3fe9da301d8e39679b25a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dda76f60fc029ca399d075a347def87ffc2c7b8d","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-30201","ref":"SPARK-30201","sha":"dda76f60fc029ca399d075a347def87ffc2c7b8d","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr intends to add `ExplainMode` for explaining `Dataset/DataFrame` with a given format mode (`ExplainMode`). `ExplainMode` has four types along with the SQL EXPLAIN command: `Simple`, `Extended`, `Codegen`, `Cost`, and `Formatted`.\r\n\r\nFor example, this pr enables users to explain DataFrame/Dataset with the `FORMATTED` format implemented in #24759;\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(10).groupBy(\"id\").count().explain(ExplainMode.Formatted)\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n* HashAggregate (3)\r\n+- * HashAggregate (2)\r\n   +- * Range (1)\r\n\r\n(1) Range [codegen id : 1]\r\nOutput: [id#0L]\r\n     \r\n(2) HashAggregate [codegen id : 1]\r\nInput: [id#0L]\r\n     \r\n(3) HashAggregate [codegen id : 1]\r\nInput: [id#0L, count#8L]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes from [the @cloud-fan suggestion.](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24759#issuecomment-560211270)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo follow the SQL EXPLAIN command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, this is just for a new API in Dataset.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd tests in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the condition to check if BytesToBytesMap should grow up its internal array. Specifically, it changes to compare by the capacity of the array, instead of its size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOne Spark job on our cluster hangs forever at BytesToBytesMap.safeLookup. After inspecting, the long array size is 536870912.\r\n\r\nCurrently in BytesToBytesMap.append, we only grow the internal array if the size of the array is less than its MAX_CAPACITY that is 536870912. So in above case, the array can not be grown up, and safeLookup can not find an empty slot forever.\r\n\r\nBut it is wrong because we use two array entries per key, so the array size is twice the capacity. We should compare the current capacity of the array, instead of its size.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis issue only happens when loading big number of values into BytesToBytesMap, so it is hard to do unit test. This is tested manually with internal Spark job.\r\n\r\nThis is a manual test case. Once the number of keys reaches 268435456, lookup will hang forever.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\n  public void testCapacity() {\r\n    TestMemoryManager memoryManager2 =\r\n            new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently loading application page from history server is time consuming, if the eventlog size is high. (Eg: ~47 minutes for a 18GB eventlog file). Currently, when there is any changes in event log, history server parses the entire eventLog even for smaller changes in eventLog. In this PR, we are supporting incremental parsing of event log by storing the in memory store to a hash map and will not close the store until it is valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo speed up loading history server page\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT, Manual tests and existing tests.\r\n\r\nCreated an eventLog of size ~2GB. Added a few more events. Loading time without the PR is ~1 minute and after the PR, it is around 2 secs.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->","created_at":"2019-12-09T19:03:13Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T00:29:52Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T00:29:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4124466c4cd8c9f66f58fbc1af929ddda05259ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe have a parser rule for column position, but we fail the query if it's specified, because the builtin catalog can't support add/alter column with column position.\r\n\r\nSince we have the catalog plugin API now, we should let the catalog implementation to decide if it supports column position or not. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nnot yet\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nadd the factor `numExecutorsExiting` in YarnAllocator's method `updateResourceRequests` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nwhen driver lost its executors because of machine hardware problem and all of service includes nodemanager, executor on the node has been killed,  it means that Resourcemanager can't update the containers info on the node until Resourcemanager try to remove the node,   but it always takes 10 mins or longger, and in the meantime, AM doesn't add the new resource request and driver missing executors. \r\nso maybe AM should add the factor `numExecutorsExiting` in YarnAllocator's method `updateResourceRequests`  to optimize it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded `shutdownHook` for shutdown method of executor plugin. This will ensure that shutdown method will be called always.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhenever executors are not going down gracefully, i.e getting killed due to idle time or getting killed forcefully, shutdown method of executors plugin is not getting called. Shutdown method can be used to release any resources that plugin has acquired during its initialisation. So its important to make sure that every time a executor goes down shutdown method of plugin gets called. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested Manually.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a `tail` API. \r\n\r\nNamely, as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(10).head(5)\r\nres1: Array[Long] = Array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\r\nscala> spark.range(10).tail(5)\r\nres2: Array[Long] = Array(5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementation details will be similar with `head` but it will be reversed:\r\n\r\n1. Run the job against the last partition and collect rows. If this is enough, return as is.\r\n2. If this is not enough, calculate the number of partitions to select more based upon\r\n `spark.sql.limit.scaleUpFactor`\r\n3. Run more jobs against more partitions (in a reversed order compared to head) as many as the number calculated from 2.\r\n4. Go to 2.\r\n\r\n**Note that**, we don't guarantee the natural order in DataFrame in general - there are cases when it's deterministic and when it's not. We probably should write down this as a caveat separately.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMany other systems support the way to take data from the end, for instance, pandas[1] and\r\n Python[2][3]. Scala collections APIs also have head and tail\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in Spark, we only provide a way to take data from the start\r\n (e.g., DataFrame.head).\r\n\r\nThis has been requested multiple times here and there in Spark user mailing list[4], StackOverFlow[5][6], JIRA[7] and other third party projects such as\r\n Koalas[8]. In addition, this missing API seems explicitly mentioned in comparison to another system[9] time to time.\r\n\r\nIt seems we're missing non-trivial use case in Spark and this motivated me to propose this API.\r\n\r\n[1] https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html?highlight=tail#pandas.DataFrame.tail\r\n[2]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd optimizer rule PruneHiveTablePartitions pruning hive table partitions based on filters on partition columns.\r\nDoing so, the total size of pruned partitions may be small enough for broadcast join in JoinSelection strategy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn JoinSelection strategy, spark use the \"plan.stats.sizeInBytes\" to decide whether the plan is suitable for broadcast join.\r\nCurrently, \"plan.stats.sizeInBytes\" does not take \"pruned partitions\" into account, so it may miss some broadcast join and take sort-merge join instead, which will definitely impact join performance.\r\nThis PR aim at taking \"pruned partitions\" into account for hive table in \"plan.stats.sizeInBytes\" and then improve performance by using broadcast join if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis is based on #25919, credits should go to @lianhuiwang and @advancedxy.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-09T08:27:55Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T02:05:45Z","closed_at":"2020-01-21T13:26:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b82370323951d140e441910780bce69b6e2e2f10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1798d52147b081c7073f3c096eb886a867b921d","head":{"label":"fuwhu:SPARK-15616","ref":"SPARK-15616","sha":"b1798d52147b081c7073f3c096eb886a867b921d","user":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42981239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk4MTIzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"fuwhu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fuwhu","id":12389745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg5NzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12389745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu","html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuwhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fuwhu/spark","description":"Mirror

We don't publish this as a part of Spark documentation (see also https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/_plugins/copy_api_dirs.rb#L30) and most of them are copy of Hive thrift server so that we can officially use Hive 2.3 release.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't much make sense to check the documentation generation against another domain, and that we don't use in documentation publish.\r\n\r\n### Why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Replace `Seq[String]` by `Seq[_]` in `StopWordsRemoverSuite` because `String` type is unchecked due erasure.\r\n- Throw an exception for default case in `MLTest.checkNominalOnDF` because we don't expect other attribute types currently.\r\n- Explicitly cast float to double in `BigDecimal(y)`. This is what the `apply()` method does for `float`s.\r\n- Replace deprecated `verifyZeroInteractions` by `verifyNoInteractions`.\r\n- Equivalent replacement of `\\0` by `\\^@` in `CSVExprUtilsSuite`\r\n- Import `scala.language.implicitConversions` in `CollectionExpressionsSuite`, `HashExpressionsSuite` and in `ExpressionParserSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix compiler warnings showed in the JIRA ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30170 . Eliminating the warning highlights other warnings which could take more attention to real problems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current implementation of `SparkShellLoggingFilter`, if the log level of the root logger and the log level of a message are different, whether a message should logged is decided based on log4j's configuration but whether the message should be output to the REPL's console is not cared.\r\nSo, if the log level of the root logger is `DEBUG`, the log level of REPL's logger is `WARN` and the log level of a message is `INFO`, the message will output to the REPL's console even though `INFO < WARN`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26798/files#diff-bfd5810d8aa78ad90150e806d830bb78L237\r\n\r\nThe ideal behavior should be like as follows and implemented them in this change.\r\n\r\n1. If the log level of a message is greater than or equal to the log level of the root logger, the message should be logged but whether the message is output to the REPL's console should be decided based on whether the log level of the message is greater than or equal to the log level of the REPL's logger.\r\n\r\n2. If a log level or custom appenders are explicitly defined for a category, whether a log message via the logger corresponding to the category is logged and output to the REPL's console should be decided baed on the log level of the category.\r\nWe can confirm whether a log level or appenders are explicitly set to a logger for a category by `Logger#getLevel` and `Logger#getAllAppenders.hasMoreElements`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug breaking a compatibility.\r\n\r\n#9816 enabled REPL's log4j configuration to override root logger but #23675 seems to have broken the feature.\r\nYou can see one example when you modifies the default log4j configuration like as follows.\r\n```\r\n# Change the log level for rootCategory to DEBUG\r\nlog4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, console\r\n\r\n...\r\n# The log level for repl.Main remains WARN\r\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.spark.repl.Main=WARN\r\n```\r\nIf you launch REPL with the configuration, INFO level logs appear even though the log level for REPL is WARN.\r\n```\r\n・・・\r\n\r\n19/12/08 23:31:38 INFO Utils: Successfully started service 'sparkDriver' on port 33083.\r\n19/12/08 23:31:38 INFO SparkEnv: Registering MapOutputTracker\r\n19/12/08 23:31:38 INFO SparkEnv: Registering BlockManagerMaster\r\n19/12/08 23:31:38 INFO BlockManagerMasterEndpoint: Using org.apache.spark.storage.DefaultTopologyMapper for getting topology information\r\n19/12/08 23:31:38 INFO BlockManagerMasterEndpoint: BlockManagerMasterEndpoint up\r\n19/12/08 23:31:38 INFO SparkEnv: Registering BlockManagerMasterHeartbeat\r\n\r\n・・・\r\n```\r\nBefore #23675 was applied, those INFO level logs are not shown with the same log4j.properties.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The logging behavior for REPL is fixed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManual test and newly added unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-08T14:59:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T22:30:33Z","closed_at":"2019-12-13T22:30:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a78ab2a0971584c10979e9587902461853228a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace `setJacksonOptions()` in `JSONOptions` by `buildJsonFactory()` which builds `JsonFactory` using `JsonFactoryBuilder`. This allows to avoid using **deprecated** feature configurations from `JsonParser.Feature`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The changes eliminate the following compilation warnings in `sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/json/JSONOptions.scala`:\r\n```\r\n    Warning:Warning:line (137)Java enum ALLOW_NUMERIC_LEADING_ZEROS in Java enum Feature is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    factory.configure(JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_NUMERIC_LEADING_ZEROS, allowNumericLeadingZeros)\r\n    Warning:Warning:line (138)Java enum ALLOW_NON_NUMERIC_NUMBERS in Java enum Feature is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    factory.configure(JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_NON_NUMERIC_NUMBERS, allowNonNumericNumbers)\r\n    Warning:Warning:line (139)Java enum ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER in Java enum Feature is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    factory.configure(JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_BACKSLASH_ESCAPING_ANY_CHARACTER,\r\n    Warning:Warning:line (141)Java enum ALLOW_UNQUOTED_CONTROL_CHARS in Java enum Feature is deprecated: see corresponding Javadoc for more information.\r\n    factory.configure(JsonParser.Feature.ALLOW_UNQUOTED_CONTROL_CHARS, allowUnquotedControlChars)\r\n```\r\n- This put together building JsonFactory and set options from JSONOptions. So, we will not forget to call `setJacksonOptions` in the future.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy `JsonSuite`, `JsonFunctionsSuite`, `JsonExpressionsSuite`.","created_at":"2019-12-08T11:25:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:54Z","closed_at":"2019-12-15T14:46:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6963e00d3b87a330b5a6a9fcc8c4e648082adf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/009103ac99d8e7dbf05df5f82ff888d65c555d90","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:eliminate-warning","ref":"eliminate-warning","sha":"009103ac99d8e7dbf05df5f82ff888d65c555d90","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26793 and aims to initialize `~/.m2` directory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn case of cache reset, `~/.m2` directory doesn't exist. It causes a failure.\r\n- `master` branch has a cache as of now. So, we missed this.\r\n- `branch-2.4` has no cache as of now, and we hit this failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR is tested against personal `branch-2.4`.\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use [Google Maven

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI am putting existing functionality behind an API that allows for developers to customize how executors are brought up and down. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Companies may require that executor creation be done by privileged resources (like admin controllers / operators who would receive events or updates) that would create the Kubernetes Executor pods on-behalf of the user. In essence, the assumption that the driver has the appropriate service-account to create pods is not a guarantee in various organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [x] integration tests\r\n- [x] Ran an implementation of the API against dev and prod, extending a custom Kubernetes CRD\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-07T00:34:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T00:10:22Z","closed_at":"2020-03-21T00:10:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a74ca8f4e9f8cc9839a5d6afcb9f80662a34278","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c208fc4775e79295e6fba991129ac55699b76005","head":{"label":"ifilonenko:pluggable-pod-allocation","ref":"pluggable-pod-allocation","sha":"c208fc4775e79295e6fba991129ac55699b76005","user":{"login":"ifilonenko","id":4926714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjY3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ifilonenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92633687,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjYzMzY4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ifilonenko/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ifilonenko","id":4926714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjY3MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ifilonenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ifilonenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ifilonenko/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBefore this PR, the method `checkAnswer` in Object `QueryTest` returns an optional string. It doesn't throw exceptions when errors happen.\r\nThe actual exceptions are thrown in the trait `QueryTest`.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some test suites(`StreamSuite`, `SessionStateSuite`, `BinaryFileFormatSuite`, etc.) that use the no-op method `QueryTest.checkAnswer` and expect it to fail test cases when the execution results don't match the expected answers. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n1. the method `checkAnswer` in Object `QueryTest` will fail tests on errors or unexpected results.\r\n2. add a new method `getErrorMessageInCheckAnswer`, which is exactly the same as the previous version of `checkAnswer`. There are some test suites use this one to customize the test failure message.\r\n3. for the test suites that extend the trait `QueryTest`, we should use the method `checkAnswer` directly, instead of calling the method from Object `QueryTest`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe should fix these method calls to perform actual validations in test suites.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2019-12-06T22:36:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T16:59:05Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T13:19:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9488f81482efa30aaaaf6337583618a83bcf3c87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26788/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26788/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26788/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7fd4057c5bd2c3c71426319d087b9ea58a8aff0e","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixCheckAnswer","ref":"fixCheckAnswer","sha":"7fd4057c5bd2c3c71426319d087b9ea58a8aff0e","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes to extend data exchange options for vectorized UDF functions, by introducing the possibility to have plain Arrow serialization without conversions to Pandas. \r\nThis PR proposes to introduce SCALAR_ARROW pandas_udf type as a step in that direction. As detailed in the test case below, the performance results are quite promising, in particular when processing data sets with numerical arrays, showing a speedup of 3x in the test case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHaving the possibility to deploy vectorized Python UDFs that bypass the conversion to_pandas, can provide performance improvements (see test below) and extended flexibility (as the Arrow type system is broader than Pandas's) for operating data manipulation, in particular this is relevant for data sets including numerical arrays, possibly of variable length. While conversion to Pandas covers many cases already for vectorized Python UDF in a satisfying manner, the proposed improvement applies to certain special cases, notably of interested for scientific computing (such as in high energy physics), where performant processing of arrays of variable length is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nA test case shows a measured increase of performance of about 3x using the proposed approach, compared to the equivalent processing with pandas_udf (details below in the test section).  Processing of Arrow data in the test case was done via the \"awkward arrays\" library (https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array).\r\nIn general, we can imagine that more specialized libraries using Arrow for data exchange can appear in the future to address computational needs in specific domains, possibly covering also cases of ML and DL libraries. It can be advantageous for Apache Spark to add the possibility to hook to such libraries, as proposed in the PR or with similar methods, for gains in performance and extra flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis PR introduces an extension of pandas_udf types with a new SCALAR_ARROW type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Manually tested:  a proposed \"SCALAR_ARROW\" pandas_udf test, detailed below, runs in 21 seconds vs. 62 seconds of the corresponding version with standard \"pandas_udf SCALAR\" code. This is close to a 3x speedup. The test is implemented using the awkward array library https://pypi.org/project/awkward/ for data processing, in alternative to Pandas:\r\n```\r\nbin/pyspark --master local[2]\r\n\r\ndf = sql(\"select cast(1.0 as double) col1, rand(42) col2, Array(rand(),rand(),rand()) col3 from range(1e8)\")\r\ndf.printSchema()\r\n\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: double (nullable = false)\r\n |-- col2: double (nullable = false)\r\n |-- col3: array (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- element: double (containsNull = false)\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\nimport awkward\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(ArrayType(DoubleType()), PandasUDFType.SCALAR_ARROW)\r\ndef test_arrow(col1):\r\n    b = awkward.fromarrow(col1.chunk(0))\r\n    c = awkward.toarrow(b * b)\r\n    return c \r\n\r\n// Note: following SPARK-28264 this can also be written as:\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n@pandas_udf(ArrayType(DoubleType()))\r\ndef test_arrow(col1: pa.ChunkedArray) -> pa.Array:\r\n    b = awkward.fromarrow(col1.chunk(0))\r\n    c = awkward.toarrow(b * b)\r\n    return c \r\n\r\nimport time\r\nstart = time.time()\r\ndf.withColumn('test', test_arrow(df.col3)).write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"overwrite\").save()\r\nend = time.time()\r\nprint(end - start)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. This is the reference code with pandas_udf SCALAR (this runs in 62 seconds vs. 21 seconds of the code above with SCALAR_ARROW implementation):\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(ArrayType(DoubleType()), PandasUDFType.SCALAR)\r\ndef test_pandas(col1):\r\n  return col1*col1\r\n\r\nimport time\r\nstart = time.time()\r\ndf.withColumn('test', test_pandas(df.col3)).write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"overwrite\").save()\r\nend = time.time()\r\nprint(end - start)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. This is how the test workload can be implemented using Spark SQL (with higher order SQL functions). This test rund in 11 seconds\r\n```\r\nimport time\r\nstart = time.time()\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"col1\", \"col2\", \"col3\", \"transform(col3, x -> x * x) as test\").write.format(\"noop\").mode(\"overwrite\").save()\r\nend = time.time()\r\nprint(end - start)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the test workload runs 6x slower than Spark SQL with pandas_udf of type SCALAR, and 2x slower than Spark SQL with the proposed arrow-only serialization with SCALAR_PYARROW pandas_udf.\r\n\r\n----\r\nIn addition, we collected and compared Flamegraph profiling of the Python code execution on the Python daemons, in the 2 Python UDF cases tested (SCALAR UDF and nthe proposed SCALAR_ARROW type). Results show that in the SCALAR case **an important amount of time is spent in the to_pandas conversion** operations and in array processing, the SCALAR_ARROW case optimizes processing of array data and avoid conversion to Pandas for array data, thus saving considerable time. \r\n\r\nThis is a Flamegraph of workload on the Python daemon when running the pandas_udf

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24405\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current implementation of _from_avro_ and _AvroDataToCatalyst_ doesn't allow doing schema evolution since it requires the deserialization of an Avro record with the exact same schema with which it was serialized.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to add a new option `actualSchema` to allow passing the schema used to serialize the records. This allows using a different compatible schema for reading by passing both schemas to _GenericDatumReader_. If no writer's schema is provided, nothing changes from before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nConsider the following example.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// schema ID: 1\r\nval schema1 = \"\"\"\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"record\",\r\n    \"name\": \"MySchema\",\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n        {\"name\": \"col1\", \"type\": \"int\"},\r\n        {\"name\": \"col2\", \"type\": \"string\"}\r\n     ]\r\n}\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\n// schema ID: 2\r\nval schema2 = \"\"\"\r\n{\r\n    \"type\": \"record\",\r\n    \"name\": \"MySchema\",\r\n    \"fields\": [\r\n        {\"name\": \"col1\", \"type\": \"int\"},\r\n        {\"name\": \"col2\", \"type\": \"string\"},\r\n        {\"name\": \"col3\", \"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"\"}\r\n     ]\r\n}\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two schemas are compatible - i.e. you can use `schema2` to deserialize events serialized with `schema1`, in which case there will be the field `col3` with the default value.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that you have two dataframes (read from batch or streaming), one with Avro events from schema1 and the other with events from schema2. **We want to combine them into one dataframe** for storing or further processing.\r\n\r\nWith the current `from_avro` function we can only decode each of them with the corresponding schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscalaval df1 = ... // Avro events created with schema1\r\ndf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [eventBytes: binary]\r\nscalaval decodedDf1 = df1.select(from_avro('eventBytes, schema1) as \"decoded\")\r\ndecodedDf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decoded: struct<col1: int, col2: string>]\r\n\r\nscalaval df2= ... // Avro events created with schema2\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [eventBytes: binary]\r\nscalaval decodedDf2 = df2.select(from_avro('eventBytes, schema2) as \"decoded\")\r\ndecodedDf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decoded: struct<col1: int, col2: string, col3: string>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut then `decodedDf1` and `decodedDf2` have different Spark schemas and we can't union them. Instead, with the proposed change we can decode `df1` in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscalaimport scala.collection.JavaConverters._\r\nscalaval decodedDf1 = df1.select(from_avro(data = 'eventBytes, jsonFormatSchema = schema2, options = Map(\"actualSchema\" -> schema1).asJava) as \"decoded\")\r\ndecodedDf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [decoded: struct<col1: int, col2: string, col3: string>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that both dataframes have the same schemas and can be merged.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis PR allows users to pass a new configuration but it doesn't affect current code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new unit test was added.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-06T13:12:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T09:38:36Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T09:26:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"589ffc77ac430026c979099f8b37066863e9eb81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26780/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26780/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26780/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/827e409a737382b2f8e42cf885d0d6b82f325b2d","head":{"label":"Fokko:SPARK-27506","ref":"SPARK-27506","sha":"827e409a737382b2f8e42cf885d0d6b82f325b2d","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49888791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTg4ODc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Fokko/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`add file \"abc.txt\"` and `add file 'abc.txt'` are not supported. \r\nFor these two spark sql gives `FileNotFoundException`. \r\nOnly `add file abc.txt` is supported currently.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes path can be given as quoted text for ADD FILE, ADD JAR, LIST FILE, LIST JAR commands in spark-sql\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn many of the spark-sql commands (like create table ,etc )we write path in quoted format only.  To maintain this consistency we should support quoted format with this command as well.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Now users can write path with quotes.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-06T12:53:09Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T09:22:33Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T09:11:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54134754ad7e8d311d7dfed9bdfb72c4db01e323","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b808d51a05a4c382550b4648690ca68660ae0e3a","head":{"label":"iRakson:SPARK-30150","ref":"SPARK-30150","sha":"b808d51a05a4c382550b4648690ca68660ae0e3a","user":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n \r\nSupport DELETE JAR functionality in spark. On deletion the jar will be removed from the `IsolatedClientLoader` classpath and from `SharedState` classpath. It also removes the jar from `addedJars` map, so that next set of taskSet won't get these jars\r\n\r\n**Sequence Diagram**\r\n\r\n![DeleteJarFlow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35216143/70412690-61a93480-1a7b-11ea-9e1d-81d7fc60b8f4.png)\r\n\r\n`IsolatedClientLoader.deleteJar` Deletes the jar from `hiveClassLoader` and recreates the classLaoder\r\n`SparkContext.deleteJar` removes the jar from `addedJars` list\r\n`SharedState.deleteJar` Removes the jar from the sessionState class Loader\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf the jar definition is changed, use can delete the jar and add new one. This process does not require service to be restarted. Even Hive supports the DELETE jar feature.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, new feature will be introduced to the user. Same will be updated in documentation as per the jira SPARK-30135\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT and also tested maually with the following testcases\r\n1. Tested in spark-shell,spark-sql and beeline\r\n2. With no schema like /opt/somepath/somejar.jar, hdfs\r\n3.  With fullpath or only with jarname\r\n4.  dropping invalid jar\r\n5. Tested with Hive-2.3.6

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this pull request, we are going to support `SET OWNER` syntax for databases and namespaces,\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER (DATABASE|SCHEME|NAMESPACE)

ownerships for the catalog objects. In https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/332e252a1448a27cfcfc1d1d794f7979e6cd331a, we determined to use properties to store ownership staff, and temporarily used `alter database ... set dbproperties ...` to support switch ownership of a database. This PR aims to use the formal syntax to replace it.\r\n\r\nIn hive, `ownerName/Type` are fields of the database objects, also they can be normal properties.\r\n```\r\ncreate schema test1 with dbproperties('ownerName'='yaooqinn')\r\n```\r\nThe create/alter database syntax will not change the owner to `yaooqinn` but store it in parameters. e.g.\r\n```\r\n+----------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------+--+\r\n| db_name  | comment  |                           location                            | owner_name  | owner_type  |      parameters       |\r\n+----------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------+--+\r\n| test1    |          | hdfs://quickstart.cloudera:8020/user/hive/warehouse/test1.db  | anonymous   | USER        | {ownerName=yaooqinn}  |\r\n+----------+----------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------------+--+\r\n```\r\nIn this pull request, because we let the `ownerName` become reversed, so it will neither change the owner nor store in dbproperties, just be omitted silently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFormal syntax support for changing database ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, add a new syntax\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

awaits the termination of the stream execution thread. However, the stream execution thread may block forever depending on the streaming source implementation (like in Kafka, which runs UninterruptibleThreads).\r\n\r\nThis causes control flow applications to hang indefinitely as well. We'd like to introduce a timeout to stop the execution thread, so that the control flow thread can decide to do an action if a timeout is hit. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nBy default, no.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nClasses like DoubleAsIfIntegral are not found in Scala 2.13, but used in the current build.

user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt should not as it copies in 2.12's existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nseparate the configuration keys \"spark.sql.optimizer.maxIterations\" and \"spark.sql.analyzer.maxIterations\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, both Analyzer and Optimizer use conf \"spark.sql.optimizer.maxIterations\" to set the max iterations to run, which is a little confusing.\r\nIt is clearer to add a new conf \"spark.sql.analyzer.maxIterations\" for analyzer max iterations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReprocess all PostgreSQL dialect related PRs, listing in order:\r\n\r\n- #25158: PostgreSQL integral division support [revert]\r\n- #25170: UT changes for the integral division support [revert]\r\n- #25458: Accept \"true\", \"yes\", \"1\", \"false\", \"no\", \"0\", and unique prefixes as input and trim input for the boolean data type. [revert]\r\n- #25697: Combine below 2 feature tags into \"spark.sql.dialect\" [revert]\r\n- #26112: Date substraction support [keep the ANSI-compliant part]\r\n- #26444: Rename config \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"spark.sql.dialect.spark.ansi.enabled\" [revert]\r\n- #26463: Cast to boolean support for PostgreSQL dialect [revert]\r\n- #26584: Make the behavior of Postgre dialect independent of ansi mode config [keep the ANSI-compliant part]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs the discussion in http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-PostgreSQL-dialect-td28417.html, we need to remove PostgreSQL dialect form code base for several reasons:\r\n1. The current approach makes the codebase complicated and hard to maintain.\r\n2. Fully migrating PostgreSQL workloads to Spark SQL is not our focus for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, the config `spark.sql.dialect` will be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-04T23:25:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T18:03:00Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T17:22:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ffcc42ec9a968f48666f3c5fbdcbb65dc04393b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17a3c778c1c584d62e81acedc4742b2e50a83027","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-30125","ref":"SPARK-30125","sha":"17a3c778c1c584d62e81acedc4742b2e50a83027","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR I have added a dataframe function `array_median` that takes in one argument i.e. the array, checks that it only contains numeric values and returns the median value as a double.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is known that there isn't any exact median function in Spark SQL, and this might be a difficult problem to solve efficiently. However, to find the median for an array should be a simple task, and something that users can utilize when collecting numeric values to a list or set.\r\n\r\nThere is a ticket requesting exact median: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26589\r\n\r\nAnd some online questions regarding medians and exact medians:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/41431270/how-to-find-exact-median-for-grouped-data-in-spark?rq=1\r\nhttps://www.edureka.co/community/24516/how-can-i-calculate-exact-median-with-apache-spark\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47988133/to-find-median-value-of-a-data-frame-in-apache-spark\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/31432843/how-to-find-median-and-quantiles-using-spark)\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/28158729/how-can-i-calculate-exact-median-with-apache-spark\r\n\r\nThis is not an aggregate function per se, but in other DBs you can find exact median functions:\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0061839.html\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_MEDIAN.html\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions086.htm\r\nhttp://www.h2database.com/html/functions-aggregate.html#median\r\n\r\nor have extensions implementing it:\r\nhttps://pgxn.org/dist/quantile/ \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new function will be available for users, `array_median`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nunit tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-04T23:20:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T00:14:46Z","closed_at":"2020-03-16T00:14:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5ddfb6ae00eac8f1c731abfd0412875b60a8ece","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a77be2d284acb38d6ce82c2e57607f5eabedeec1","head":{"label":"hagerf:array_median","ref":"array_median","sha":"a77be2d284acb38d6ce82c2e57607f5eabedeec1","user":{"login":"hagerf","id":5435221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzUyMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5435221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf","html_url":"https://github.com/hagerf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214430026,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ0MzAwMjY=","name":"spark_fork","full_name":"hagerf/spark_fork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hagerf","id":5435221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MzUyMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5435221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf","html_url":"https://github.com/hagerf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hagerf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hagerf/spark_fork","description":"Apache

Utils.nanSafeCompare{Doubles,Floats}, just use java.lang.{Double,Float}.compare directly. All work identically w.r.t. NaN when used to `compare`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSimplification of the previous change, which existed to support Scala 2.13 migration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any

\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemoved unnecessary persist.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPersist in `PythonMLLibAPI.scala` is unnecessary because later in `run()` of `gmmAlg` is caching the data. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/710ddab39e20f49e917311c3e27d142b5a2bcc71/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/clustering/GaussianMixture.scala#L167-L171\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-04T13:33:21Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T02:26:06Z","closed_at":"2019-12-05T17:54:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ace298a511509beee282956a21b097fe4b368034","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c59e81ed4feab9ec72af8e4b4ff637c882a542b3","head":{"label":"amanomer:improperPersist","ref":"improperPersist","sha":"c59e81ed4feab9ec72af8e4b4ff637c882a542b3","user":{"login":"amanomer","id":40591404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTkxNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40591404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer","html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203616393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM2MTYzOTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"amanomer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amanomer","id":40591404,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTkxNDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40591404?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer","html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amanomer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amanomer/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding support for pagination in streaming tab for completed batch table using existing framework for pagination. Refer PR #26215 \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf our streaming job is running for long time and number of batches are huge then out of memory error may come while loading the streaming page. Introducing pagination will solve this problem and also improve the loading time of page. Besides jobs,stages,sql and thrift-server page contains pagination. So it also brings consistency.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe use Spark as ad-hoc query engine. Most of users' SELECT queries with LIMIT operation like\r\n1) SELECT * FROM TABLE_A LIMIT N\r\n2) SELECT colA FROM TABLE_A LIMIT N\r\n3) CREATE TAB_B as SELECT * FROM TABLE_A LIMIT N\r\nIf the TABLE_A is a large table (a RDD with thousands and thousands of partitions), the execution time would be very big since it has to list all files to build a RDD before execution. But almost time, the N is just like 10, 100, 1000, not very big. We don't need to scan all files. This optimization will create a **SinglePartitionReadRDD** to address it.\r\n\r\nIn our production result, this optimization benefits a lot. The duration time of simple query with LIMIT could reduce 5~10 times. For example, before this optimization, a query on a table which has about one hundred thousands files would run over 30 seconds, after applying this optimization, the time decreased to 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nShould support both Spark DataSource Table and Hive Table which can be converted to DataSource table.\r\nShould support bucket table, partition table, normal table.\r\nShould support different file formats like parquet, orc.\r\nThis PR only addresses Spark datasource table.\r\nHive table and view will be filed after this merged.\r\n\r\n### How to implement?\r\n1. Add two configurations, `PARTIAL_LISTING_ENABLED` and `PARTIAL_LISTING_MAX_FILES`\r\n2. In `FindDataSourceTable.apply()`, we resolve `GlobalLimit` to add a flag `partialListing` to `FileIndex`\r\n3. In `DataSourceScanExec.inputRDD`, by checking the flag `partialListing` in `relation.location`, we create a `SinglePartitionReadRDD`. This RDD will assign less than `PARTIAL_LISTING_MAX_FILES` files to a single partition.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to allow insert overwrite same table if using dynamic partition overwrite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, Insert overwrite cannot overwrite to same table even it is dynamic partition overwrite. But for dynamic partition overwrite, we do not delete partition directories ahead. We write to staging directories and move data to final partition directories. We should be able to insert overwrite to same table under dynamic partition overwrite.\r\n\r\nThis enables users to read data from a table and insert overwrite to same table by using dynamic partition overwrite. Because this is not allowed for now, users need to write to other temporary location and move it back to the table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Users can insert overwrite same table if using dynamic partition overwrite.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR exposes the existing logic for nested schema pruning to all sources, which is in line with the description of `SupportsPushDownRequiredColumns` .\r\n\r\nRight now, `SchemaPruning` (rule, not helper utility) is applied in the optimizer directly on certain instances of `Table` ignoring `SupportsPushDownRequiredColumns` that is part of `ScanBuilder`. I think it would be cleaner to perform schema pruning and filter push-down in one place. Therefore, this PR moves all the logic into `V2ScanRelationPushDown`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change allows all V2 data sources to benefit from nested column pruning (if they support it).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR mostly relies on existing tests. On top, it adds one test to verify that top-level schema pruning works as well as one test for predicates with subqueries.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T18:07:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T21:41:09Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T21:41:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ac463b09132badab568dbc73451c46870b23502","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26751/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26751/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26751/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d732b28eb0ca2a383b3d0ad4d9da7742f138d32","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:nested-schema-pruning-ds-v2","ref":"nested-schema-pruning-ds-v2","sha":"4d732b28eb0ca2a383b3d0ad4d9da7742f138d32","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `TableProvider` only accepts table schema and properties. It should accept table partitioning as well.\r\n\r\nThis is extracted from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25651, to only keep the API changes and make the diff smaller.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAlthough `DataFrameReader`/`DataStreamReader` don't support user-specified partitioning, we need to pass the table partitioning when getting tables from `TableProvider` if we store tables in Hive metastore with v2 provider.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nnot yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDepend on type coercion when building the replace query. This would solve an edge case where when trying to replace `NaN`s, `0`s would get replace too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis Scala code snippet:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.math;\r\n\r\nprintln(Double.NaN.toLong)\r\n```\r\nreturns `0` which is problematic as if you run the following Spark code, `0`s get replaced as well:\r\n```\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1.0, 0), (0.0, 3), (float('nan'), 0)], (\"index\", \"value\"))\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    0|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  NaN|    0|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n>>> df.replace(float('nan'), 2).show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    2|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  2.0|    2|\r\n+-----+-----+ \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the PR, running the same above code snippet returns the correct expected results:\r\n```\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1.0, 0), (0.0, 3), (float('nan'), 0)], (\"index\", \"value\"))\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    0|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  NaN|    0|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n>>> df.replace(float('nan'), 2).show()\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|index|value|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|  1.0|    0|\r\n|  0.0|    3|\r\n|  2.0|    0|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\nAnd additionally, query results are changed as a result of the change in depending on scala's type coercion rules.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests to verify replacing `NaN` only affects columns of type `Float` and `Double`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T16:30:38Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:24:15Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T05:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd783e3996b7abd4cb29e5208d35616afd98aa89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f23d113df6d5bc6610337d949ec0d7f34eb2439d","head":{"label":"johnhany97:SPARK-30082-2.4","ref":"SPARK-30082-2.4","sha":"f23d113df6d5bc6610337d949ec0d7f34eb2439d","user":{"login":"johnhany97","id":2394761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQ3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97","html_url":"https://github.com/johnhany97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":225399980,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjUzOTk5ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"johnhany97/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johnhany97","id":2394761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzOTQ3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2394761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97","html_url":"https://github.com/johnhany97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnhany97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johnhany97/spark","description":"Apache

The lines changed below otherwise generate about 440 warnings when building for 2.13.\r\n\r\nThe previous PR directly replaced many usages with `Symbol(\"foo\")`. But it's also used to specify Columns via implicit conversion (`.select('foo)`) or even where simple Strings are used (`.as('foo)`), as it's kind of an abstraction for interned Strings.\r\n\r\nWhile I find this syntax confusing and would like to deprecate it, here I just replaced it where it generates a build warning (not sure why all occurrences don't): `$\"foo\"` or just `\"foo\"`.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen PCA was first impled in [SPARK-5521](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5521), at that time Matrix.multiply(BLAS.gemv internally) did not support sparse vector. So worked around it by applying a sparse matrix multiplication.\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-7681](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7681), BLAS.gemv supported sparse vector. So we can directly use Matrix.multiply now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfor simplity\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this
