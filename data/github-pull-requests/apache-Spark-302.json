What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current internal `table()` API of `SparkSession` bypasses the Analyzer and directly calls `sessionState.catalog.lookupRelation` API. This skips the view resolution logics in our Analyzer rule `ResolveRelations`. This internal API is widely used by various DDL commands, public and internal APIs.\r\n\r\nUsers might get the strange error caused by view resolution when the default database is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains implementation of the basic submission client for the cluster mode of Spark on Kubernetes. It's step 2 from the step-wise plan documented [here](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark/issues/441#issuecomment-330802935).\r\nThis addition is covered by the [SPIP](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/SPIP-Spark-on-Kubernetes-td22147.html) vote which passed on Aug 31.\r\n\r\nThis PR and #19468 together form a MVP of Spark on Kubernetes that allows users to run Spark applications that use resources locally within the driver and executor containers on Kubernetes 1.6 and up. Some changes on pom and build/test setup are copied over from #19468 to make this PR self contained and testable.\r\n\r\nThe submission client is mainly responsible for creating the Kubernetes pod that runs the Spark driver. It follows a step-based approach to construct the driver pod, as the code under the `submit.steps` package shows. The steps are orchestrated by `DriverConfigurationStepsOrchestrator`. `Client` creates the driver pod and waits for the application to complete if it's configured to do so, which is the case by default. \r\n\r\nThis PR also contains Dockerfiles of the driver and executor images. They are included because some of the environment variables set in the code would not make sense without referring to the Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* The patch contains unit tests which are passing.\r\n* Manual testing: ./build/mvn -Pkubernetes clean package succeeded.\r\n* It is a subset of the entire changelist hosted at http://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark which is in active use in several organizations.\r\n* There is integration testing enabled in the fork currently hosted by PepperData which is being moved over to RiseLAB CI.\r\n* Detailed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPython `sklearn` has an implementation of random search to complement grid search. This usually allows for more efficient hyperparameter tuning.\r\n\r\nI have developed an alternative class to `ParamGridBuilder` called `RandomParamGridBuilder` which will facilitate random search in Spark. This works by creating the same data structure as the output of `ParamGridBuilder.build()` (and so is compatible with the existing `CrossValidator` class), through random sampling.\r\n\r\nThe main methods by which the random sampling is used in the `sklearn` implementation are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Sampling through options e.g. `[0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]` \r\n  - This is handled using `addUniformChoice`\r\n- Sampling and integer/long/float/double between bounds \r\n  - `RandomParamGrid` has the `addUniformDistribution` method for this\r\n- Boolean sampling\r\n  - `RandomParamGrid.addUniformDistribution` supports this as well\r\n- Or sampling over a more exotic distribution (e.g. beta or Cauchy)\r\n  - Here the user can implement their own function which when called returns a value from the intended distribution, and add that using `addDistribution` thereby allowing full flexibility.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSeveral unit tests have been created for the `RandomParamGridBuilder` in `RandomParamGridBuilderSuite`. \r\nIn `CrossValidatorSuite`, two tests were changed to run with param maps created by `RandomParamGridBuilder` as well as those from `ParamGridBuilder`. One additional test was added there as well (altered version of a `ParamGridBuilder` test).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nadd multi columns support to  QuantileDiscretizer.\r\nWhen calculating the splits, we can either merge together all the  probabilities into one array by calculating approxQuantiles on multiple columns at once, or compute approxQuantiles separately  for each column. After doing the performance comparision, we found it’s better to calculating approxQuantiles on multiple columns at once. \r\n\r\nHere is how we measuring the performance time:\r\n```\r\n    var duration = 0.0\r\n    for (i<- 0 until 10) {\r\n      val start = System.nanoTime()\r\n      discretizer.fit(df)\r\n      val end = System.nanoTime()\r\n      duration += (end - start) / 1e9\r\n    }\r\n    println(duration/10)\r\n```\r\nHere is the performance test result: \r\n\r\n|numCols |NumRows  | compute each approxQuantiles separately|compute multiple columns approxQuantiles at one time|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current internal `table()` API of `SparkSession` bypasses the Analyzer and directly calls `sessionState.catalog.lookupRelation` API. This skips the view resolution logics in our Analyzer rule `ResolveRelations`. This internal API is widely used by various DDL commands, public and internal APIs.\r\n\r\nUsers might get the strange error caused by view resolution when the default database is different.\r\n```\r\nTable or view not found: t1; line 1 pos 14\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table or view not found: t1; line 1 pos 14\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix it by enforcing it to use `ResolveRelations` to resolve the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOne powerful feature of `Dataset` is, we can easily map SQL rows to Scala/Java objects and do runtime null check automatically.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say we have a parquet file with schema `<a: int, b: string>`, and we have a `case class Data(a: Int, b: String)`. Users can easily read this parquet file into `Data` objects, and Spark will throw NPE if column `a` has null values.\r\n\r\nHowever the null checking is left behind for top-level primitive values. For example, let's say we have a parquet file with schema `<a: Int>`, and we read it into Scala `Int`. If column `a` has null values, we will get some weird results.\r\n```\r\nscala> val ds = spark.read.parquet(...).as[Int]\r\n\r\nscala> ds.show()\r\n+----+\r\n|v   |\r\n+----+\r\n|null|\r\n|1   |\r\n+----+\r\n\r\nscala> ds.collect\r\nres0: Array[Long] = Array(0, 1)\r\n\r\nscala> ds.map(_ * 2).show\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|-2   |\r\n|2    |\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because internally Spark use some special default values for primitive types, but never expect users to see/operate these default value directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds null check for top-level primitive values\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen run in YARN cluster mode, the StructuredKafkaWordCount example fails because Spark tries to create a temporary checkpoint location in a

The modified version of `SQLListener` respects the setting `spark.ui.retainedStages` and keeps the number of the tracked stages within the specified limit. The hash map `_stageIdToStageMetrics` does not outgrow the limit, hence overall memory consumption does not grow with time anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test covers

change is a little larger because there's a whole lot of logic\r\nbehind these pages, all really tied to internal types and listeners,\r\nand some of that logic had to be implemented in the new listener and\r\nthe needed data exposed through the API types.\r\n\r\n- Added missing StageData and ExecutorStageSummary fields which are\r\n  used by the UI. Some json golden files needed to be updated to account\r\n  for new fields.\r\n\r\n- Save RDD graph data in the store. This tries to re-use existing types as\r\n  much as possible, so that the code doesn't need to be re-written. So it's\r\n  probably not very optimal.\r\n\r\n- Some old classes (e.g. JobProgressListener) still remain, since they're used\r\n  in other parts of the code; they're not used by the UI anymore, though, and\r\n  will be cleaned up in a separate change.\r\n\r\n- Save information about active pools in the store. This data is not really used\r\n  in the SHS, but it's not a lot of data so it's still recorded when replaying\r\n  applications.\r\n\r\n- Because the new store sorts things slightly differently from the previous\r\n  code, some json golden files had some elements within them shuffled around.\r\n\r\n- The retention unit test in UISeleniumSuite was disabled because the code\r\n  to throw away old stages / tasks hasn't been added yet.\r\n\r\n- The job description field in the API tries to follow the old behavior, which\r\n  makes it be empty most of the time, even though there's information to fill it\r\n  in. For stages, a new field was added to hold the description (which is basically\r\n  the job description), so that the UI can be rendered in the old way.\r\n\r\n- A new stage status (\"SKIPPED\") was added to account for the fact that the API\r\n  couldn't represent that state before. Without this, the stage would show up as\r\n  \"PENDING\" in the UI, which is now based on API types.\r\n\r\n- The API used to expose \"executorRunTime\" as the value of the task's duration,\r\n  which wasn't really correct (also because that value was easily available\r\n  from the metrics object); this change fixes that by storing the correct duration,\r\n  which also means a few expectation files needed to be updated to account for\r\n  the new durations and sorting differences due to the changed values.\r\n\r\n- Added changes to implement SPARK-20713 and SPARK-21922 in the new code.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests (and by using the UI a lot).","created_at":"2017-11-08T19:03:33Z","updated_at":"2017-11-14T17:45:42Z","closed_at":"2017-11-14T16:37:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"436361413b0892d93c08d1fde5d02bd335a41851","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0454ed1ad5bf36cf6c6f5ebdf899298daf2a50eb","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20648","ref":"SPARK-20648","sha":"0454ed1ad5bf36cf6c6f5ebdf899298daf2a50eb","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

this pull request?**\r\n\tThis PR aims to support comparators, e.g. '<', '<=', '>', '>=', again in Apache Spark 2.0 for backward compatibility.\r\n        **Spark 1.6**\r\n        `scala> sql(\"CREATE

`org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:`\r\n        `mismatched input '<' expecting {')', ','}(line 1, pos 42)`\r\n        After this PR, it's supported.\r\n\t**How was this patch tested?**\r\n        Pass the Jenkins test with a newly added testcase.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16036 points out that if we use int literal in DROP PARTITION will fail after patching https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15704.\r\nThe reason of this failing in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15704 is that AlterTableDropPartitionCommand tells BinayComparison and EqualTo with following code:\r\n\r\n`private def isRangeComparison(expr: Expression): Boolean = {  `\r\n    `expr.find(e => e.isInstanceOf[BinaryComparison] && !e.isInstanceOf[EqualTo]).isDefined }`\r\n\r\nThis PR resolve this problem by telling a drop condition when parsing sqls.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew testcase introduced from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor the few Dataset actions such as `foreach`, currently no SQL metrics are visible in the SQL tab of SparkUI. It is because it binds wrongly to Dataset's `QueryExecution`. As the actions directly evaluate on the RDD which has individual `QueryExecution`, to show correct SQL metrics on UI, we should bind to RDD's `QueryExecution`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe issue has been raised in two Jira tickets: [SPARK-21657](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21657), [SPARK-16998](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16998). Basically, what happens is that in collection generators like explode/inline we create many rows from each row. Currently each exploded row contains also the column on which it was created. This causes, for example, if we have a 10k array in one row that this array will get copy 10k times - to each of the row. this results a qudratic memory consumption. However, it is a common case that the original column gets projected out after the explode, so we can avoid duplicating it.\r\nIn this solution we propose to identify this situation in the optimizer and turn on a flag for omitting the original column in the generation process.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. We added a benchmark test to MiscBenchmark that shows x16 improvement in runtimes.\r\n2. We ran some of the other tests in MiscBenchmark and they show 15% improvements.\r\n3. We ran this code on a specific case from our production data with rows containing arrays of size ~200k and it reduced the runtime from 6 hours to 3 mins.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-07T11:53:42Z","updated_at":"2017-12-29T13:11:26Z","closed_at":"2017-12-29T13:11:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fc42758e7ec99b4b1959ec4f90b96f59637f89d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4edd88402e807aea741ff7f34077103d8d614656","head":{"label":"uzadude:optimize_explode","ref":"optimize_explode","sha":"4edd88402e807aea741ff7f34077103d8d614656","user":{"login":"uzadude","id":15645757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15645757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude","html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62064979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjA2NDk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"uzadude/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uzadude","id":15645757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15645757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude","html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude/spark","description":"Mirror

change replaces the SQLListener with a new implementation that\r\nsaves the data to the same store used by the SparkContext's status\r\nstore. For that, the types used by the old SQLListener had to be\r\nupdated a bit so that they're more serialization-friendly.\r\n\r\nThe interface for getting data from the store was abstracted into\r\na new class, SQLAppStatusStore (following the convention used in\r\ncore).\r\n\r\nAnother change is the way that the SQL UI hooks up into the core\r\nUI or the SHS. The old \"SparkHistoryListenerFactory\" was replaced\r\nwith a new \"AppStatePlugin\" that more explicitly differentiates\r\nbetween the two use cases: processing events, and showing the UI.\r\nBoth live apps and the SHS use this new API (previously, it was\r\nrestricted to the SHS).\r\n\r\nNote on the above: this causes a slight change of behavior for\r\nlive apps; the SQL tab will only show up after the first execution\r\nis started.\r\n\r\nThe metrics gathering code was re-worked a bit so that the types\r\nused are less memory hungry and more serialization-friendly. This\r\nreduces memory usage when using in-memory stores, and reduces load\r\ntimes when using disk stores.\r\n\r\nTested with existing and added unit tests. Note one unit test was\r\ndisabled because it depends on SPARK-20653, which isn't in yet.","created_at":"2017-11-07T00:31:13Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T16:50:56Z","closed_at":"2017-11-14T21:31:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"789f818b6fb3ebb4a8a30b3a4c2ec14b02d0c3d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c068a5bb88e73532018d8f7a8dbbf96ffb6a93d8","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20652","ref":"SPARK-20652","sha":"c068a5bb88e73532018d8f7a8dbbf96ffb6a93d8","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA: [SPARK-22461](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22461)\r\n\r\nThis patch moves `LinearRegression[Training]Summary`, `LogisticRegression[Training]Summary` `[KMeans|GaussianMixture|BisectingKMeans]Summary` into a new `org.apache.spark.ml.summary` module. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new summary hierarchy is created, that all current and future summaries can inherit from.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntrait PredictionSummary\r\ntrait SupervisedPredictionSummary extends PredictionSummary\r\n\r\ntrait RegressionSummary extends

ProbabilisticClassificationSummary extends ClassificationSummary\r\ntrait BinaryProbabilisticClassificationSummary extends BinaryClassificationSummary  with ProbabilisticClassificationSummary\r\n\r\ntrait ClusteringSummary extends PredictionSummary\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch is part of an effort to clean up some of the existing code and will also help make it easier to add model summaries to other models since they can simply extend this API.

captured in the listener, so that's also fixed,\r\nalong with some minor (internal) API adjustments so that the UI can\r\nget the correct data.\r\n\r\nBecause of the way partitions are cached, some optimizations w.r.t. how\r\noften the data is flushed to the store could not be applied to this code;\r\nbecause of that, some different ways to make the code more performant\r\nwere added to the data

executors page is built on top of the REST API, so the page itself\r\nwas easy to hook up to the new code.\r\n\r\nSome other pages depend on the `ExecutorListener` class that is being\r\nremoved, though, so they needed to be modified to use data from the\r\nnew store. Fortunately, all they seemed to need is the map of executor\r\nlogs, so that was somewhat easy too.\r\n\r\nThe executor timeline graph required adding some properties to the\r\nExecutorSummary API type. Instead of following the previous code,\r\nwhich stored all the listener events in memory, the timeline is\r\nnow created based on the data available from the API.\r\n\r\nI had to change some of the test golden files because the old code would\r\nreturn executors in \"random\" order (since it used a mutable Map instead\r\nof something that returns a sorted list), and the new code returns executors\r\nin id order.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests.","created_at":"2017-11-06T20:01:04Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T18:47:19Z","closed_at":"2017-11-08T05:17:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"000f93c407fb5084fa4fd3ac70bd6a4c7853a2f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7123d9c8d3934c482cd89ea820b2958f4dbbe0a","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20646","ref":"SPARK-20646","sha":"c7123d9c8d3934c482cd89ea820b2958f4dbbe0a","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `errorifexists` to SparkR API and fix the rest of them describing the mode, mainly, in API documentations as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR also replaces `convertToJSaveMode` to `setWriteMode` so that string as is is passed to JVM and executes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b034f2565f72aa73c9f0be1e49d148bb4cf05153/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameWriter.scala#L72-L82\r\n\r\nand remove the

this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checked the built documentation. These were mainly found by `` grep -r `error` `` and `grep -r 'error'`.\r\n\r\nAlso, unit tests added in `test_sparkSQL.R`.","created_at":"2017-11-06T13:34:38Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:16Z","closed_at":"2017-11-09T06:03:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc5aabf592a2777542636c91052c6ae29aadb545","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/900ee2908c7bd9613cd5043f72576946c0ecd5e9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-21640-followup","ref":"SPARK-21640-followup","sha":"900ee2908c7bd9613cd5043f72576946c0ecd5e9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[Ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22297)\r\n- one of the tests seems to produce unreliable results due to execution speed variability\r\n\r\nSince the original test was trying to connect to the test server with `40 ms` timeout, and the test server replied after `50 ms`, the error might be produced under the following conditions:\r\n- it might occur that the test server replies correctly after `50 ms`\r\n- but the client does only receive the timeout after `51 ms`s\r\n- this might happen if the executor has to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe do not need generate all possible splits for unordered features before aggregate,\r\n\r\n- Change `mixedBinSeqOp` (which running on executor), for each unordered feature, we do the same stat with ordered features. so for unordered features, we only need O(numCategories) space for this feature stat.\r\n\r\n- After driver side get the aggregate result, generate all possible split combinations, and compute the best split.\r\n\r\nThis will reduce decision tree aggregate size for each unordered feature from `O(2^numCategories)` to `O(numCategories)`, `numCategories` is the arity of this unordered feature.\r\n\r\nThis also reduce the cpu cost in executor side. Reduce time complexity for this unordered feature from `O(numPoints * 2^numCategories)` to `O(numPoints)`.\r\n\r\nThis won't increase time complexity for unordered features best split computing in driver side.\r\n\r\n### How to construct statistics of `2^(numCategories - 1) - 1` splits from separate statistics of`numCategories` ?\r\n\r\nI use a recursive function `traverseUnorderedSplits` to traverse all possible splits, and note that, during the traversing, the statistics for each splits will be accumulated, so it will keep the total time complexity to be O(2^n).\r\nI give an example, suppose unordered feature including [a, b, c, d], for each split, decode it by binary representation, e.g, \"1010\" represent split \"[a, c] vs [b, d]\" (the \"1\" represent allocate the value to left child).\r\nAnd the `combNumber` of the split is the number whose binary representation match it. (Note that the binary representation is lower bits start from left).\r\nThe `combNumber` will be used for \"pruning\". (will explain in the following)\r\n\r\nNow we want to traverse all possible splits, all possible binary representation will be `2^numCategories`, but, the splits number only have `2^(numCategories - 1) - 1` , because we need to exclude the case binary representation all \"0\" and all \"1\", and the remaining splits, we need to cut half of them, because split \"[a, c] vs [b, d]\" and split \"[b, d] vs [a, c]\" are equivalent, we only need to traverse one of them. The way I use here to filter out the other half is via the `combNumber`, we only need to traverse the cases whose `combNumber` satisfy `1 <= combNumber <= numSplists`.\r\n\r\nSo I design the `traverseUnorderedSplits` function to do the thing.\r\nFirst we can look into the `dfs` function in the `traverseUnorderedSplits`, it's a recursive function, when running, it will compute the `combNumber` at the same time. When founding current `combNumber` exceed `numSplits`, stop recursion.\r\nIn the recursive `dfs`, it also accumulate the statistics. When generating a new split, for example, \"[a, c] vs [b, d]\", we need compute the statistics for left child, which equals to `stats[a] + stats[c]`. But, I do not compute this accumulation after the split generated, it will cause the algorithm time complexity to be `O(n*2^n)`, I accumulate the stat in the recursion process. You can check the param `stats` of `dfs` to see how it works.\r\n\r\nSo, my purpose of why `traverseUnorderedSplits` is designed in this way, the main two reasons:\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix `dev/run-tests.py` script to support Python 3.\r\n\r\nHere are some backgrounds. Up to my knowledge, \r\n\r\nIn Python 2,\r\n- `unicode` is NOT `str` in Python 2 (`type(\"foo\") != type(u\"foo\")`).\r\n- `str` has an alias, `bytes` in Python 2 (`type(\"foo\") == type(b\"foo\")`).\r\n\r\nIn Python 3,\r\n- `unicode` was (roughly) replaced by `str` in Python 3 (`type(\"foo\") == type(u\"foo\")`).\r\n- `str` is NOT `bytes` in Python 3 (`type(\"foo\") != type(b\"foo\")`).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, this PR fixes:\r\n\r\n  1. Use `b''` instead of `''` so that both `str` in Python 2 and `bytes` in Python 3 can be hanlded. `sbt_proc.stdout.readline()` returns `str` (which has an alias, `bytes`) in Python 2 and `bytes` in Python 3\r\n\r\n  2. Similarily, use `b''` instead of `''` so that both `str` in Python 2 and `bytes` in Python 3 can be hanlded. `re.compile` with `str` pattern does not seem supporting to match `bytes` in Python 3:\r\n\r\nActually, this change is recommended up to my knowledge - https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html#text-versus-binary-data:\r\n\r\n> Mark all binary literals with a b prefix, textual literals with a u prefix\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested this via Python 3 with few additional changes to reduce the elapsed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor a class with field name of special characters, e.g.:\r\n```scala\r\ncase class MyType(`field.1`: String, `field 2`: String)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough we can manipulate DataFrame/Dataset, the field names are encoded:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val df = Seq(MyType(\"a\", \"b\"), MyType(\"c\", \"d\")).toDF\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [field$u002E1: string, field$u00202: string]\r\nscala> df.as[MyType].collect\r\nres7: Array[MyType] = Array(MyType(a,b), MyType(c,d))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt causes resolving problem when we try to convert the data with non-encoded field names:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.json(path).as[MyType]\r\n...\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`field$u002E1`' given input columns: [field 2, fie\r\nld.1];\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.package$AnalysisErrorAt.failAnalysis(package.scala:42)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should use decoded field name in Dataset schema.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

metestore for not seeing hive-site.xml in AM/Driver's classpath.\r\n\r\nAlthough submitting them with `--files/--jars local/path/to/hive-site.xml` or puting it to `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR/YARN_CONF_DIR` can make these apps works well in cluster mode as client mode, according to the official doc, see @ http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#hive-tables\r\n> Configuration of Hive is done by placing your hive-site.xml, core-site.xml (for security configuration), and hdfs-site.xml (for HDFS configuration) file in conf/.\r\n\r\nWe may respect these configuration files too or modify the doc for hive-tables in cluster mode.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ncc @cloud-fan @gatorsmile

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUDFs that can cause runtime exception on invalid data are not safe to pushdown, because its behavior depends on its position in the query plan. Pushdown of it will risk to change its original behavior.\r\n\r\nThe example reported in the JIRA and taken as test case shows this issue. We should declare UDFs that can cause runtime exception on invalid data as non-determinstic.\r\n\r\nThis updates the document of `deterministic` property in `Expression` and states clearly an UDF that can cause runtime exception on some specific input, should be declared as non-determinstic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`CodegenContext.copyResult` is kind of a global status for whole stage codegen. But the tricky part is, it is only used to transfer an information from child to parent when calling the `consume` chain. We have to be super careful in `produce`/`consume`, to set it to true when producing multiple result rows, and set it to false in operators that start new pipeline(like sort).\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the `copyResult` to `CodegenSupport`, and call it at `WholeStageCodegenExec`. This is much easier to reason about.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe're building a data lineage tool in which we need to monitor the metadata changes in ExternalCatalog, current ExternalCatalog already provides several useful events like \"CreateDatabaseEvent\" for custom SparkListener to use. But still there's some event missing, like alter database event and alter table event. So here propose to and new ExternalCatalogEvent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnrich the current UT and tested on local cluster.\r\n\r\nCC @hvanhovell please let me know your comments about current proposal,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's not safe in all cases to push down a LIMIT below a FULL OUTER\r\nJOIN. If the limit is pushed to one side of the FOJ, the physical\r\njoin operator can not tell if a row in the non-limited side would have a\r\nmatch in the other side.\r\n\r\n*If* the join operator guarantees that unmatched tuples from the limited\r\nside are emitted before any unmatched tuples from the other side,\r\npushing down the limit is safe. But this is impractical for some join\r\nimplementations, e.g. SortMergeJoin.\r\n\r\nFor now, disable limit pushdown through a FULL OUTER JOIN, and we can\r\nevaluate whether a more complicated solution is necessary in the future.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan org.apache.spark.sql.* tests. Altered full outer join tests in\r\nLimitPushdownSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-03T00:08:32Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T01:17:43Z","closed_at":"2017-11-05T05:50:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20860ca354ca651cf77019ed778a71f829357d17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e0123b0887aa33c382a63ee7843be5f64d38b41","head":{"label":"henryr:spark-22211","ref":"spark-22211","sha":"0e0123b0887aa33c382a63ee7843be5f64d38b41","user":{"login":"henryr","id":89301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr","html_url":"https://github.com/henryr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108333516,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgzMzM1MTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"henryr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"henryr","id":89301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MzAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr","html_url":"https://github.com/henryr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henryr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/henryr/spark","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19622 to master branch.\r\n\r\nThis bug doesn't exist in master because we've added hive bucketing support and the hive bucketing metadata can be recognized by Spark, but we should still port it to master: 1) there may be other unsupported hive metadata removed by Spark. 2) reduce code difference between master and 2.2 to ease the backport in the feature.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWhen we alter table schema, we set the new schema to spark `CatalogTable`, convert it to hive table, and finally call `hive.alterTable`. This causes a problem in Spark 2.2, because hive bucketing metedata is not recognized by Spark, which means a Spark `CatalogTable` representing a hive table is always non-bucketed, and when we convert it to hive table and call `hive.alterTable`, the original hive bucketing metadata will be removed.\r\n\r\nTo fix this bug, we should read out the raw hive table metadata, update its schema, and call `hive.alterTable`. By doing this we can guarantee only the schema is changed, and nothing else.","created_at":"2017-11-02T13:31:19Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T22:44:02Z","closed_at":"2017-11-02T22:44:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba7f2d4431d3256c342e84f2a6c388fcd08e23b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16714bc43d51b5248b67f44e3ed46374ed36c1ea","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:infer","ref":"infer","sha":"16714bc43d51b5248b67f44e3ed46374ed36c1ea","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we insert `BatchEvalPython` for Python UDFs into a query plan, if its child has some outputs that are not used by the original parent node, `BatchEvalPython` will still take those outputs and save into the queue. When the data for those outputs are big, it is easily to generate big spill on disk.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following reproducible code is from the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n\r\nlines_of_file = [ \"this is a line\" for x in xrange(10000) ]\r\nfile_obj = [ \"this_is_a_foldername/this_is_a_filename\", lines_of_file ]\r\ndata = [ file_obj for x in xrange(5) ]\r\n\r\nsmall_df = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data).map(lambda x : (x[0], x[1])).toDF([\"file\", \"lines\"])\r\nexploded = small_df.select(\"file\", explode(\"lines\"))\r\n\r\ndef split_key(s):\r\n    return s.split(\"/\")[1]\r\n\r\nsplit_key_udf = udf(split_key, StringType())\r\n\r\nwith_filename = exploded.withColumn(\"filename\", split_key_udf(\"file\"))\r\nwith_filename.explain(True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe physical plan before/after this change:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*Project [file#0, col#5, pythonUDF0#14 AS filename#9]\r\n+- BatchEvalPython [split_key(file#0)], [file#0, lines#1, col#5, pythonUDF0#14]\r\n   +- Generate explode(lines#1), true, false, [col#5]\r\n      +- Scan ExistingRDD[file#0,lines#1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*Project [file#0, col#5, pythonUDF0#14 AS filename#9]\r\n+- BatchEvalPython [split_key(file#0)], [col#5, file#0, pythonUDF0#14]\r\n   +- *Project [col#5, file#0]\r\n      +- Generate explode(lines#1), true, false, [col#5]\r\n         +- Scan ExistingRDD[file#0,lines#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this change, `lines#1` is a redundant input to `BatchEvalPython`. This patch removes it by adding a Project.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.","created_at":"2017-11-02T10:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:54Z","closed_at":"2017-11-04T12:13:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdf6c20cc6470141f2b2bc33eacf539e98027776","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2711eaf25f55c954842ee9498f9706df33d69e1a","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-22410","ref":"SPARK-22410","sha":"2711eaf25f55c954842ee9498f9706df33d69e1a","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI added adjusted R2 as a regression metric which was implemented in all major statistical analysis tools.\r\n\r\nIn practice, no one looks at R2 alone. The reason is R2 itself is misleading. If we add more parameters, R2 will not decrease but only increase (or stay the same). This leads to overfitting. Adjusted R2 addressed this issue by using number of parameters as \"weight\" for the sum of errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added a new unit test and passed.\r\n- ./dev/run-tests all passed.","created_at":"2017-11-02T05:15:15Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T16:15:44Z","closed_at":"2017-11-15T16:15:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6200ae13f04f5b03d15a68ddf453e67953f7d65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68e467e1e78f2deb9aaa6fe2d6cfd907736d5668","head":{"label":"tengpeng:master","ref":"master","sha":"68e467e1e78f2deb9aaa6fe2d6cfd907736d5668","user":{"login":"tengpeng","id":2724786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjQ3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2724786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng","html_url":"https://github.com/tengpeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108185981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDgxODU5ODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"tengpeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tengpeng","id":2724786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjQ3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2724786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng","html_url":"https://github.com/tengpeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tengpeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tengpeng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNow, type coercion for IN is not coherent between Literals and subquery. This PR changes the behavior for the case with literals and makes it coherent with the case of the subquery and also with the binary comparisons.\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, when IN is used with literals, we are using `findWiderCommonType` to determine the type to cast all the elements in the list and the value attribute of the In operator. This is not consistent with the behavior In has when there is a subquery, where we are using `findCommonTypeForBinaryComparison`.\r\n\r\nThe PR changes In type coercion with Literals to make it coherent to the one with subqueries (which is also the one used in other places, like simple comparisons).\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe heuristic to calculate the maxSplitSize in DataSourceScanExec is as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d28d5732ae205771f1f443b15b10e64dcffb5ff0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L431\r\n\r\nbytesPerCore is calculated based on the default parallelism. Default parallelism in this case is the number of total cores of all the registered executors for this application. The heuristic works well with static allocation but with dynamic allocation enabled, defaultParallelism is usually one (with default config of min and initial executors as zero) at the time of split calculation. This heuristic was introduced in SPARK-14582.\r\n\r\nWith dynamic allocation it is confusing to tune the split size with this heuristic. It is better to ignore bytesPerCore and use the values of 'spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes' as the max split size.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-01T20:13:26Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T00:08:18Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T00:08:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1811a61c1eae25783de60a7d917d22262d4a8790","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3aff40637da077f4f9cee655d6fb24b0b204a5d","head":{"label":"vgankidi:SPARK-22411","ref":"SPARK-22411","sha":"d3aff40637da077f4f9cee655d6fb24b0b204a5d","user":{"login":"vgankidi","id":4732316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzIzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4732316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi","html_url":"https://github.com/vgankidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105693956,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU2OTM5NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vgankidi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vgankidi","id":4732316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzIzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4732316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi","html_url":"https://github.com/vgankidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vgankidi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vgankidi/spark","description":"Mirror

main goal of this change is to allow multiple cluster-mode\r\nsubmissions from the same JVM, without having them end up with\r\nmixed configuration. That is done by extending the SparkApplication\r\ntrait, and doing so was reasonably trivial for standalone and\r\nmesos modes.\r\n\r\nFor YARN mode, there was a complication. YARN used a \"SPARK_YARN_MODE\"\r\nsystem property to control behavior indirectly in a whole bunch of\r\nplaces, mainly in the SparkHadoopUtil / YarnSparkHadoopUtil classes.\r\nMost of the changes here are removing that.\r\n\r\nSince we removed support for Hadoop 1.x, some methods that lived in\r\nYarnSparkHadoopUtil can now live in SparkHadoopUtil. The remaining\r\nmethods don't need to be part of the class, and can be called directly\r\nfrom the YarnSparkHadoopUtil object, so now there's a single\r\nimplementation of SparkHadoopUtil.\r\n\r\nThere were two places in the code that relied on  SPARK_YARN_MODE to\r\nmake decisions about YARN-specific functionality, and now explicitly check\r\nthe master from the configuration for that instead:\r\n\r\n* fetching the external shuffle service port, which can come from the YARN\r\n  configuration. \r\n\r\n* propagation of the authentication secret using Hadoop credentials. This also\r\n  was cleaned up a little to not need so many methods in `SparkHadoopUtil`.\r\n\r\nWith those out of the way, actually changing the YARN client\r\nto extend SparkApplication was easy.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests, and also by running YARN apps\r\nwith auth and kerberos both on and off in a real cluster.","created_at":"2017-11-01T17:52:26Z","updated_at":"2017-12-04T19:05:52Z","closed_at":"2017-12-04T19:05:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8e0ee11f573d18d6b60068f26231eaec0763c99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c752453b2a379f301d52692bfc639bb631520069","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-22372","ref":"SPARK-22372","sha":"c752453b2a379f301d52692bfc639bb631520069","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror
