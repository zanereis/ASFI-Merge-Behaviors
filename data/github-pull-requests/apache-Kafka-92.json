allows us to run highly granular and configurable workloads to directly simulate customer scenarios and measure the end to end latency all within Trogdor.\r\n\r\nThis creates a new `ConfigurableProducer` workload that can be used to tune many parts of the workload better than the `ProduceBench` workload.\r\n\r\nThis also creates all the helper classes for the `ConfigurableProducer` workload.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new parameter to the `ConsumeBench` workload to allow for processing of records after polling them.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a new E2E latency test utilizing the new record processor within the `ConsumeBench` workload.\r\n\r\n---\r\n# ConfigurableProducer workload\r\n\r\nThe ConfigurableProducer workload allows for customized and even variable configurations in terms of messages per second, message size, batch size, key size, and even the ability to target a specific partition out of a topic.\r\n\r\nThe parameters that differ from ProduceBenchSpec:\r\n\r\n* `flushGenerator` - Used to instruct the KafkaProducer when to issue flushes.  This allows us to simulate variable batching since batch flushing is not currently exposed within the KafkaProducer class.\r\n* `throughputGenerator` - Used to throttle the ConfigurableProducerWorker based on a calculated number of messages within a window.\r\n* `activeTopic` - This class only supports execution against a single topic at a time.  If more than one topic is specified, the ConfigurableProducerWorker will throw an error.\r\n* `activePartition` - Specify a specific partition number within the activeTopic to run load against, or specify `-1` to allow use of all partitions.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"startMs\": 1606949497662,\r\n    \"durationMs\": 3600000,\r\n    \"producerNode\": \"trogdor-agent-0\",\r\n    \"bootstrapServers\": \"some.example.kafka.server:9091\",\r\n    \"flushGenerator\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"gaussian\",\r\n        \"messagesPerFlushAverage\": 16,\r\n        \"messagesPerFlushDeviation\": 4\r\n    },\r\n    \"throughputGenerator\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"gaussian\",\r\n        \"messagesPerSecondAverage\": 500,\r\n        \"messagesPerSecondDeviation\": 50,\r\n        \"windowsUntilRateChange\": 100,\r\n        \"windowSizeMs\": 100\r\n    },\r\n    \"keyGenerator\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"constant\",\r\n        \"size\": 8\r\n    },\r\n    \"valueGenerator\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"gaussianTimestampRandom\",\r\n        \"messageSizeAverage\": 512,\r\n        \"messageSizeDeviation\": 100,\r\n        \"timestampBytes\": 8,\r\n        \"messagesUntilSizeChange\": 100\r\n    },\r\n    \"producerConf\": {\r\n        \"acks\": \"all\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"commonClientConf\": {},\r\n    \"adminClientConf\": {},\r\n    \"activeTopic\": {\r\n        \"topic0\": {\r\n            \"numPartitions\": 100,\r\n            \"replicationFactor\": 3,\r\n            \"configs\": {\r\n                \"retention.ms\": \"1800000\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"activePartition\": 5\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example spec performed the following:\r\n\r\n* Ran on `trogdor-agent-0` for 1 hour starting at 2020-12-02 22:51:37.662 GMT\r\n* Produced with acks=all to Partition 5 of `topic0` on kafka server `some.example.kafka.server:9091`.\r\n* The average batch had 16 messages, with a standard deviation of 4 messages.\r\n* The message had a 8-bit constant key, with an average value of 512 bytes and a standard deviation of 100 bytes.\r\n* The messages had millisecond timestamps embedded in the first 8-bytes of the value.\r\n* The average throughput was 500 messages/second, with a window of 100ms and a deviation of 50 messages/second.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# ConsumeBench workload changes\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the ability for the ConsumeBench workloads to optionally process the records returned through the consumer poll call.  This is done by specifying a new `recordProcessor` parameter.  The record processor's status is then included in the workload's status.\r\n\r\n## RecordProcessor\r\n\r\nThis interface provides the ability to optionally process records after the ConsumeBench workload polls them.  The interface provides for the ability to include additional data in the status output.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 2 processing methods:\r\n\r\n* Disabled, by not specifying this parameter.\r\n* `timestamp` will use `TimestampRecordProcessor` to process records containing a timestamp in the first several bytes of the message.\r\n\r\n### TimestampRecordProcessor\r\n\r\nThis includes a `TimestampRecordProcessor` class to process records containing a timestamp in the first several bytes of the message.   This class will process records containing timestamps and generate a histogram based on the data.  It will then be present in the status from the `ConsumeBenchWorker` class.  This must be used with a timestamped PayloadGenerator implementation.\r\n\r\nHere's an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"timestampRandom\",\r\n   \"timestampBytes\": 8,\r\n   \"histogramMaxMs\": 10000,\r\n   \"histogramMinMs\": 0,\r\n   \"histogramStepMs\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will track total E2E latency up to 10 seconds, using 1ms resolution and a timestamp size of 8 bytes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# FlushGenerator\r\n\r\nA FlushGenerator is used to facilitate flushing the KafkaProducers on a cadence specified by the user.  This is useful to simulate a specific number of messages in a batch regardless of the message size, since batch flushing is not exposed in the KafkaProducer.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 3 flushing methods:\r\n\r\n* Disabled, by not specifying this parameter.\r\n* `constant` will use `ConstantFlushGenerator` to keep the number of messages per batch constant.\r\n* `gaussian` will use `GaussianFlushGenerator` to vary the number of messages per batch on a normal distribution.\r\n\r\n## ConstantFlushGenerator\r\n\r\nThis generator will flush the producer after a specific number of messages.  This does not directly control when KafkaProducer will batch, this only makes best effort.  This also cannot tell when a KafkaProducer batch is closed.  If the KafkaProducer sends a batch before this executes, this will continue to execute on its own cadence.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"constant\",\r\n   \"messagesPerFlush\": 16\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example will flush the producer every 16 messages.\r\n\r\n## GaussianFlushGenerator\r\n\r\nThis generator will flush the producer after a specific number of messages, determined by a gaussian distribution.  This does not directly control when KafkaProducer will batch, this only makes best effort.  This also cannot tell when a KafkaProducer batch is closed.  If the KafkaProducer sends a batch before this executes, this will continue to execute on its own cadence.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"gaussian\",\r\n   \"messagesPerFlushAverage\": 16,\r\n   \"messagesPerFlushDeviation\": 4\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example will flush the producer on average every 16 messages, assuming `linger.ms` and `batch.size` allow for\r\nit.  That average changes based on a normal distribution after each flush:\r\n\r\n* An average of the flushes will be at 16 messages.\r\n* ~68% of the flushes are at between 12 and 20 messages.\r\n* ~95% of the flushes are at between 8 and 24 messages.\r\n* ~99% of the flushes are at between 4 and 28 messages.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# ThroughputGenerator\r\n\r\nSimilar to the throttle class, except a simpler design.  This interface is used to facilitate running a configurable number of messages per second by throttling if the throughput goes above a certain amount.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are 2 throughput methods:\r\n\r\n* `constant` will use `ConstantThroughputGenerator` to keep the number of messages per second constant.\r\n* `gaussian` will use `GaussianThroughputGenerator` to vary the number of messages per second on a normal distribution.\r\n\r\n## ConstantThroughputGenerator\r\n\r\nThis throughput generator configures constant throughput.  The lower the window size, the smoother the traffic will be. Using a 100ms window offers no noticeable spikes in traffic while still being long enough to avoid too much overhead.\r\n\r\nDue to binary nature of throughput in terms of messages sent in a window, each window will send at least 1 message, and each window sends the same number of messages, rounded down. For example, 99 messages per second with a 100ms window will only send 90 messages per second, or 9 messages per window. Another example, in order to send only 5 messages per second, a window size of 200ms is required. In cases like these, both the `messagesPerSecond` and `windowSizeMs` parameters should be adjusted together to achieve more accurate throughput.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"constant\",\r\n   \"messagesPerSecond\": 500,\r\n   \"windowSizeMs\": 100\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will produce a workload that runs 500 messages per second, with a maximum resolution of 50 messages per 100 millisecond.\r\n\r\n## GaussianThroughputGenerator\r\n\r\nThis throughput generator configures throughput with a gaussian normal distribution on a per-window basis. You can specify how many windows to keep the throughput at the rate before changing. All traffic will follow a gaussian distribution centered around `messagesPerSecondAverage` with a deviation of `messagesPerSecondDeviation`.  The lower the window size, the smoother the traffic will be. Using a 100ms window offers no noticeable spikes in traffic while still being long enough to avoid too much overhead.\r\n\r\nDue to binary nature of throughput in terms of messages sent in a window, this does not work well for an average throughput of less than 5 messages per window.  In cases where you want lower throughput, the `windowSizeMs` must be adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"gaussian\",\r\n   \"messagesPerSecondAverage\": 500,\r\n   \"messagesPerSecondDeviation\": 50,\r\n   \"windowsUntilRateChange\": 100,\r\n   \"windowSizeMs\": 100\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will produce a workload that runs on average 500 messages per second, however that speed will change every 10 seconds due to the `windowSizeMs * windowsUntilRateChange` parameters. The throughput will have the following normal distribution:\r\n\r\n* An average of the throughput windows of 500 messages per second.\r\n* ~68% of the throughput windows are between 450 and 550 messages per second.\r\n* ~95% of the throughput windows are between 400 and 600 messages per second.\r\n* ~99% of the throughput windows are between 350 and 650 messages per second.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Additional Payload Generators\r\n\r\nThis implementation also offers additional payload generators to facilitate the tests these workloads are designed to run.  These are also compatible with the existing ProduceBench workloads.\r\n\r\n## TimestampRandomPayloadGenerator\r\n\r\nThis generator generates timestamped pseudo-random payloads that can be reproduced from run to run.  The guarantees are the same as those of java.util.Random.  The timestamp used for this class is in milliseconds since epoch, encoded directly to the first several bytes of the payload. This should be used in conjunction with TimestampRecordProcessor in the Consumer to measure true end-to-end latency of a system.\r\n\r\n* `size` - The size in bytes of each message.\r\n* `timestampBytes` - The amount of bytes to use for the timestamp.  Usually 8.\r\n* `seed` - Used to initialize Random() to remove some non-determinism.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"timestampRandom\",\r\n   \"size\": 512,\r\n   \"timestampBytes\": 8\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate a 512-byte random message with the first 8 bytes encoded with the timestamp.\r\n\r\n## GaussianTimestampRandomPayloadGenerator\r\n\r\nThis class behaves identically to TimestampRandomPayloadGenerator, except the message size follows a gaussian distribution.  This should be used in conjunction with TimestampRecordProcessor in the Consumer to measure true end-to-end latency of a system.\r\n\r\n* `messageSizeAverage` - The average size in bytes of each message.\r\n* `messageSizeDeviation` - The standard deviation to use when calculating message size.\r\n* `timestampBytes` - The amount of bytes to use for the timestamp.  Usually 8.\r\n* `messagesUntilSizeChange` - The number of messages to keep at the same size.\r\n* `seed` - Used to initialize Random() to remove some non-determinism.\r\n\r\nHere is an example spec:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"type\": \"gaussianTimestampRandom\",\r\n   \"messageSizeAverage\": 512,\r\n   \"messageSizeDeviation\": 100,\r\n   \"timestampBytes\": 8,\r\n   \"messagesUntilSizeChange\": 100\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate messages on a gaussian distribution with an average size each 512-bytes and the first 8 bytes encoded with the timestamp.  The message sizes will have a standard deviation of 100 bytes, and the size will only change every 100 messages.  The distribution of messages will be as follows:\r\n\r\n* The average size of the messages are 512 bytes.\r\n* ~68% of the messages are between 412 and 612 bytes\r\n* ~95% of the messages are between 312 and 712 bytes\r\n* ~99% of the messages are between 212 and 812 bytes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## New Functionality\r\n\r\nThe ConfigurableProducer workload was tested by running various scenarios and verifying the metrics within the Kafka cluster matched the scenario as defined.\r\n\r\n## Existing Functionality\r\n\r\nThe ConsumeBench workload was tested without specifying the `recordProcessor` parameter to verify it still behaves as it did prior to this patch set.  All other code paths are in a new workload.","created_at":"2020-12-11T19:53:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-21T16:33:51Z","closed_at":"2020-12-18T21:03:59Z","merged_at":"2020-12-18T21:03:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"baef516789f0d80ce1faba5d257a905ecb27e6fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/6591c2284acd31fde73e774c4269f278c7d5d0cc","head":{"label":"scott-hendricks:hackday","ref":"hackday","sha":"6591c2284acd31fde73e774c4269f278c7d5d0cc","user":{"login":"scott-hendricks","id":49452084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDUyMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49452084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-hendricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206123323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxMjMzMjM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"scott-hendricks/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scott-hendricks","id":49452084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDUyMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49452084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks","html_url":"https://github.com/scott-hendricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scott-hendricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scott-hendricks/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR follows #9688, to make the EosBetaUpgradeIntegrationTest more stable. Fixed some issues:\r\n1. Test failed with the error message:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.kafka.streams.errors.InvalidStateStoreException: Cannot get state store store because the stream thread is PARTITIONS_ASSIGNED, not RUNNING\r\n```\r\nhttps://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Kafka/job/kafka-trunk-jdk8/274/testReport/org.apache.kafka.streams.integration/EosBetaUpgradeIntegrationTest/shouldUpgradeFromEosAlphaToEosBeta_true_/\r\nAfter investigation, I found it's because we actually do rebalancing twice after new stream started: 1 for Adding new member, 1 for leader re-joining group during Stable. So, if we only wait for the state to be `RUNNING`, it might enter `REBALANCING` state later, and cause that we can't get store successfully \r\n\r\n2. We setUncaughtExceptionHandler, but didn't handle it well. Before, we expected the uncaught exception only got 1, but actually, we'll get 4 here (2 injected exception, 2 injected commit exception). So, we saw many messages in stderr output, which is not good for debugging. After fix, we only output to stderr when the exception is not what we expected for debugging use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

patch contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n- Separate inbound/outbound request flows so that we can open the door for concurrent inbound request handling\r\n- Rewrite `KafkaNetworkChannel` to use `InterBrokerSendThread` which fixes a number of bugs/shortcomings\r\n- Get rid of a lot of boilerplate conversions in `KafkaNetworkChannel` \r\n- Improve validation of inbound responses in `KafkaRaftClient` by checking correlationId. This fixes a bug which could cause an out of order Fetch to be applied incorrectly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-11T05:45:43Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T13:17:10Z","closed_at":"2020-12-22T02:15:16Z","merged_at":"2020-12-22T02:15:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb9fe411bbbfca1baf5e0900ee9cfb9147e5099e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c31ba33f2ffb1144e0acbe975ddf45cc5d4065bc","head":{"label":"hachikuji:refactor-raft-network-io","ref":"refactor-raft-network-io","sha":"c31ba33f2ffb1144e0acbe975ddf45cc5d4065bc","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

have fixed what looked like a potential bug to me.\r\n\r\n**Bug:**\r\nThe bug is that from within `Log.updateProducers(…)`, the code operates on the `producerStateManager` attribute of the `Log` instance instead of operating on an input parameter. Please see [this](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1d84f543678c4c08800bc3ea18c04a9db8adf7e4/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala#L1464) LOC where it calls `producerStateManager.prepareUpdate` thus accessing the attribute from the `Log` object (see [this](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1d84f543678c4c08800bc3ea18c04a9db8adf7e4/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala#L251)). This looks unusual particularly for `Log.loadProducersFromLog(...)` [path](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1d84f543678c4c08800bc3ea18c04a9db8adf7e4/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/Log.scala#L956). Here I believe we should be using the instance passed to the method, rather than the attribute from the `Log` instance. I have fixed the same in this PR.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure (yet) if this bug has any drastic consequences (probably not), but it is still worthwhile making things consistent.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nThe fix is to explicitly pass the `ProducerStateManager` into `Log.updateProducers` and move the following methods: `Log.loadProducersFromLog` and `Log.updateProducers` into the `Log` companion object.\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nRely on existing tests.","created_at":"2020-12-09T06:32:56Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T00:34:47Z","closed_at":"2020-12-12T00:34:47Z","merged_at":"2020-12-12T00:34:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdf725828bc247078458de403b17190a9da07496","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ec00e9f2226b976e618b402fd54b11b8405b5502","head":{"label":"kowshik:MINOR_fix_update_correct_ProducerStateManager_in_Log_updateProducers","ref":"MINOR_fix_update_correct_ProducerStateManager_in_Log_updateProducers","sha":"ec00e9f2226b976e618b402fd54b11b8405b5502","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

there are no pending operations, the raft IO thread can block indefinitely waiting for a network event. We rely on asynchronous wakeups in order to break the blocking wait in order to respond to a scheduled append. The current logic already does this, but only for the case when the linger time has been completed during the call to `scheduleAppend`. It is possible instead that after making one call to `scheduleAppend` to start the linger timer, the application does not do any additional appends. In this case, we still need the IO thread to wakeup when the linger timer expires. This patch fixes the problem by ensuring that the IO thread gets woken up after the first append which begins the linger timer.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

the [KIP-500 development branch](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka/tree/kip-500), we have a separate ControllerApis that shares a lot of functionality with KafkaApis. We introduced a utility class ApisUtils to pull out the common code. Some things were moved to RequestChannel as well.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to upstream this work now so we don't continue to diverge (since KafkaApis is a frequently modified class).

around.","created_at":"2020-12-08T21:01:41Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T20:28:44Z","closed_at":"2021-01-15T20:28:44Z","merged_at":"2021-01-15T20:28:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba1e16f0c02aeeaba54600c1a828f6cd13acf1a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"abbccdda","id":5845561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5845561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda","html_url":"https://github.com/abbccdda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9715/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9715/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9715/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5cf053ea3bf0d848556c10c82fa09006798ef1d8","head":{"label":"mumrah:api-utils-upstream","ref":"api-utils-upstream","sha":"5cf053ea3bf0d848556c10c82fa09006798ef1d8","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirr

id is now only present in `NetworkSend`, which is now\r\nthe class used by `Selector`/`NetworkClient`/`KafkaChannel` (which\r\nworks well since `NetworkReceive` is the class used for\r\nreceived data).\r\n\r\nThe previous `NetworkSend` was also responsible for adding a size\r\nprefix. This logic is already present in `SendBuilder`, but for the\r\nminority of cases where `SendBuilder` is not used (including\r\na number of tests), we now have `ByteBufferSend.sizePrefixed()`.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the request/message utilities:\r\n* Renamed `toByteBuffer`/`toBytes` in `MessageUtil` to\r\n`toVersionPrefixedByteBuffer`/`toVersionPrefixedBytes` for clarity.\r\n* Introduced new `MessageUtil.toByteBuffer` that does not include\r\nthe version as the prefix.\r\n* Renamed `serializeBody` in `AbstractRequest/Response` to\r\n`serialize` for symmetry with `parse`.\r\n* Introduced `RequestTestUtils` and moved relevant methods from\r\n`TestUtils`.\r\n* Moved `serializeWithHeader` methods that were only used in\r\ntests to `RequestTestUtils`.\r\n* Deleted `MessageTestUtil`.\r\n\r\nFinally, a couple of changes to simplify coding patterns:\r\n* Added `flip()` and `buffer()` to `ByteBufferAccessor`.\r\n* Added `MessageSizeAccumulator.sizeExcludingZeroCopy`.\r\n* Used lambdas instead of `TestCondition`.\r\n* Used `Arrays.copyOf` instead of `System.arraycopy` in `MessageUtil`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T20:30:17Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T19:16:03Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T19:15:59Z","merged_at":"2020-12-09T19:15:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"1f98112e993bc4ae098936b1b0661fdb2c4b1880","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e86ed57b683688e56b031287b0588284935e78cc","head":{"label":"ijuma:remove-connection-id-from-send","ref":"remove-connection-id-from-send","sha":"e86ed57b683688e56b031287b0588284935e78cc","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

the `EmbeddedConnectCluster` class masks the `Exit` procedures using within the Connect worker. This normally works great when a single instance of the embedded cluster is used. However, the `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTest` uses two `EmbeddedConnectCluster` instances, and when the first one is stopped it would reset the (static) exit procedures, and any problems during shutdown of the second embedded Connect cluster would cause the worker to shut down the JVM running the tests.\r\n\r\nInstead, the `MirrorConnectorsIntegrationTest` class should mask the `Exit` procedures and instruct the `EmbeddedConnectClusters` instances (via the existing builder method) to not mask the procedures.\r\n\r\nIdeally this should also be backported to `2.7`, `2.6`, and `2.5` branches.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

functional changes are simple: change the `WorkerSourceTask` class to only call `SourceTask::stop` from one location, during task shutdown, and only if an attempt has been made to start the task (which will not be the case if it was created in the paused state and then shut down before being started). This is important in order to prevent `SourceTask::stop` from being indirectly invoked on the herder's thread, which can have adverse effects if the task is unable to shut down promptly.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are tweaked where necessary to account for this new logic, which covers some edge cases mentioned in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5020 that were unaddressed up until now.\r\n\r\nThe existing integration tests for blocking connectors are expanded to also include cases for blocking source and sink tasks. Full coverage of every source/sink task method is intentionally omitted from these expanded tests in order to avoid inflating test runtime (each one adds an extra 5 seconds at minimum) and because the tests that are added here were sufficient to reproduce the bug with source task shutdown.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-01T19:59:55Z","updated_at":"2023-06-14T15:44:18Z","closed_at":"2020-12-04T17:48:24Z","merged_at":"2020-12-04T17:48:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f2f08eb006cdf3dc848b34b4b17cf27a023e9da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f349014317f0005564eef55ef83dde815d877e12","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-10792","ref":"kafka-10792","sha":"f349014317f0005564eef55ef83dde815d877e12","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

demos an idea I had for improving the website docs. \r\n\r\nThe docs often mention config parameters. With recent changes it's now possible to deep link directly to the the doc for a given config parameter. It would be useful for readers if we made use of this in our own docs, so when talking about `listeners` in prose we link to the doc for it. \r\n\r\nThis PR achieves that in a relatively easy-to-author way using a CSS class on the `<code>` used to wrap some config parameters and some JS which takes the class and the included text and turns it into one or more links. For example `<code class=\"brokerconfig\">listeners</code>` gets turned into a link to the doc for [`listeners`](https://kafka.apache.org/27/documentation.html#brokerconfigs_listeners), with similar classes for topic, producer consumer etc. configs.\r\n\r\nHere a're some screenshots of what the markup changes in the patch result in, first from the upgrade section:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-27 12-05-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879487/100448489-467b6e80-30aa-11eb-8794-5db0a7e4bd9f.png)\r\n\r\nThe script knows to ignore whatever is after the `=` sign. Here's another example from the security section (please excuse the magenta find-in-page highlighting):\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-27 12-06-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879487/100448544-5c892f00-30aa-11eb-99c2-17a07734bd97.png)\r\n\r\nBecause the script checks for the existence of the link before generating the link it doesn't linkify the `username` or `password` (the regex isn't powerful enough to properly understand that lines ending with `\\` are continuation lines). This is a bit of a hack, but it works well enough.\r\n\r\nThere's two potential issues I can see with this:\r\n\r\n1. Lots of client configs are shared between both producer and consumer (and admin client...), so which should we link to? Probably a link is better than no link, but equally we could chose not to link such configs.\r\n2. This is not really compatible with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2967 though it might be possible to do something similar in ReStructuredText with custom roles.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-27T12:28:29Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T03:40:45Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T03:40:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

problem is basically just that we compare two incompatible sets in ProcessorTopology#updateSourceTopics: the local `sourceNodesByName` map only contains nodes that correspond to a particular subtopology whereas the passed-in `nodeToSourceTopics` ultimately comes from the InternalTopologyBuilder's map, which contains nodes for the entire topology. So we would end up hitting the IllegalStateException thrown in #updateSourceTopics` any time we tried to update an application with more than one subtopology.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple, we just need to ignore any source nodes that aren't part of the ProcessorTopology's subtopology.","created_at":"2020-11-24T01:20:02Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T02:50:51Z","closed_at":"2020-11-25T01:59:30Z","merged_at":"2020-11-25T01:59:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbf4e63ae7e4c637917124c148d5f21193d395b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/60b95760213142ba1159d79bb1c1b1765d6ecb6b","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:10758-IllegalStateException-in-ProcessorTopology-updateSourceTopics","ref":"10758-IllegalStateException-in-ProcessorTopology-updateSourceTopics","sha":"60b95760213142ba1159d79bb1c1b1765d6ecb6b","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

2.13.4 restores default global `ExecutionContext` to 2.12 behavior\r\n(to fix a perf regression in some use cases) and improves pattern matching\r\n(especially exhaustiveness checking). Most of the changes are related\r\nto the latter as I have enabled the newly introduced `-Xlint:strict-unsealed-patmat`.\r\n\r\nMore details on the code changes:\r\n* Don't swallow exception in `ReassignPartitionsCommand.topicDescriptionFutureToState`.\r\n* `RequestChannel.Response` should be `sealed`.\r\n* Introduce sealed ClientQuotaManager.BaseUserEntity to avoid false positive\r\nexhaustiveness warning.\r\n* Handle a number of cases where pattern matches were not exhaustive:\r\neither by marking them with @unchecked or by adding a catch-all clause.\r\n* Workaround scalac bug related to exhaustiveness warnings in ZooKeeperClient\r\n* Remove warning suppression annotations related to the optimizer that are no\r\nlonger needed in ConsumerGroupCommand and AclAuthorizer.\r\n* Use `forKeyValue` in `AclAuthorizer.acls` as the scala bug preventing us from\r\nusing it seems to be fixed.\r\n* Also update scalaCollectionCompat to 2.3.0, which includes minor improvements.\r\n\r\nFull release notes:\r\n* https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.4\r\n* https://github.com/scala/scala-collection-compat/releases/tag/v2.3.0\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
