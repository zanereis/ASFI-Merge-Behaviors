Xavier initializer is borrowed from python implementation. This PR enables R package support `factor_type = c('in', 'out', 'avg')` and `rnd_type = c('gaussian', 'uniform')` to generate weights.\n\n`clip_gradient` is implemented via `pmax`/`pmin` R built-in function. \n\n`lr_scheduler` is referring to python implementation `python/lr_scheduler.py`.  I noticed there is some discussion among your developer team and hopefully my PR makes it as well.

pull request adds a new \"DropoutAllchannels\" operator, which is intended to work on batches of image or image-like inputs such as the output of convolution operations.\n\nThe DropoutAllchannels layer drops or keeps all channels of given pixels, everything else behaves just as usual.  The code is a slight modification of the Dropout operator. It is tested on CPU so far, and seems to work fine. \n\nNOTE: Yes, this operator could be emulated given existing operators, but that would be rather

API. In order to use the bucketing API, one need to add the following _extra_ properties to data iter and data batch on top of any existing `DataIter`:\n- `DataIter`\n  - `default_bucket_key`: the bucket key for the default symbol.\n- `DataBatch`\n  - `provide_data`: same as `DataIter`, but specific to this batch\n  - `provide_label`: same as `DataIter`, but specific to this batch\n  - `bucket_key`: the key for the bucket that should be used for this batch\n\nThere is a simple sanity check example with mnist in `mnist_bucket.py` -- it creates 3 buckets which are all the same. It also serves a demonstration of how the API works.\n\nI will create an example with ptb language model to demonstrate how bucketing with variable-length sequence model works soon.\n","created_at":"2016-02-11T19:54:52Z","updated_at":"2016-02-17T03:15:12Z","closed_at":"2016-02-14T04:32:44Z","merged_at":"2016-02-14T04:32:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b3d5d3bda1d800efca9438512df93d8ab7b63cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6df263f197aaae21c84afe5266a7506fff918318","head":{"label":"pluskid:master","ref":"master","sha":"6df263f197aaae21c84afe5266a7506fff918318","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d23605f1234f984d01b3c9cd7b476e74890bbd5e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR is a potential resolution to #1413.\nThe original issue is due to the serialization improperly managing references causing memory issues when certain objects get garbage collected. This PR removes the serialization in favour of lua references and dedicated lua_State per operator. This should hopefully make things more transparent as well.\n\nI have tested this with the code in #1413 (with my hack to torch to introduce more GC calls), my original net that was having issues, and examples/torch/*.py.\n\nThere is one potential race that could occur with this implementation that I don't think is possible but I want to note it down somewhere anyhow:\nCertain torch nn modules store data computed in the forward pass for use in the backward pass on them. These make the assumption that the calls to `forward` and `backward` will be alternating and never called concurrently. I am not sure if I should put in a mutex to ensure this condition is upheld. If backward and forward are called concurrently in this implementation a `CHECK_EQ(lua_gettop(L), 0);`  will most likely fail.\n","created_at":"2016-02-08T01:04:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T01:47:53Z","closed_at":"2016-02-10T01:47:53Z","merged_at":"2016-02-10T01:47:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5db574220768fb536606fc495654a04acfb9f05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1430/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1430/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1430/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f07172ba446d4b3cba7c51700431f361176062ee","head":{"label":"lukemetz:lm/torch","ref":"lm/torch","sha":"f07172ba446d4b3cba7c51700431f361176062ee","user":{"login":"lukemetz","id":1248454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1248454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz","html_url":"https://github.com/lukemetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46186827,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjE4NjgyNw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"lukemetz/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukemetz","id":1248454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1248454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz","html_url":"https://github.com/lukemetz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukemetz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukemetz/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

an API to do partial shape inference. This is to support shape inference with recurrence. Because the shape of the previous-states are unknown, so shape inference could fail. However, for many cases (e.g. elementwise `+` is used to combine `h2h` and `x2h`), we can do partial inference first and then do full shape inference after we obtain the output shape of the _next_ state. See the unittest for more details.\n\nPrevious survey on existing RNN interfaces is also committed

you for your work. I've successfully built `libmxnet.so` on with GCC+OpenBLAS and ICC+MKL separtately. If I may, I wonder why MKL is required to be statically linked into `libmxnet.so`. Dynamic linking of MKL also makes sense.\n\nMy arguments are:\n- Just like OpenBLAS, MKL provides BLAS implementation. So MKL can be linked dynamically like OpenBLAS. It doesn't bother users that much to add MKL lib path to `LD_LIBRARY` variable.\n- So far I haven't seen posts or experienced issues on using Python backed by dynamically-linked MKL.\n- Even MKL is statically linked into `libmxnet.so`, other Intel compiler libraries (libiomp5, libimf, libsvml,..) are still required at runtime.\n\nGCC + OpenBLAS:\n\n```\n$ ldd lib/libmxnet.so | grep
