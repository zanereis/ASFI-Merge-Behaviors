What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to Ambari 2.8's Bigtop stack, the default version of Hadoop is 3.3.4. Starting from Hadoop 3.3, Jetty was upgraded to version 9.4.\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16152\r\nHowever, certain parts of Ambari still retain Hadoop versions lower than 3.3, which use Jetty versions below 9.4. This leads to an API incompatibility issue, causing failures in Ambari's contributed tests that utilize the HDFS MiniCluster due to conflicting Jetty versions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the version of Hadoop should also align with the current default stack's Hadoop version to ensure consistency.\r\nand the files View within the ambari/contrib/views/ relies on the version of Hadoop to communicate with HDFS. Using version 2 of Hadoop could lead to compatibility issues.\r\n\r\nThe reason for adding the dependency on 'common-lang2' is that after upgrading the Hadoop version to 3, the code no longer has the dependency on 'org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils' present in Hadoop 2. This is because Hadoop 3 uses Commons Lang 3.x. Without this dependency, the code compilation will fail. Therefore, adding this dependency resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/18082602/c6e1dbb3-06be-46e0-8c86-90956f4f3962)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/ambari/assets/18082602/8ca139c7-7b16-48e4-a0fe-dac50c5b8cf7)\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPhantomJS is a headless web browser scriptable with JavaScript. The package is no longer maintained and does not even support ES6 features of Javascript. \r\nChrome launched ChromeHeadless which works very similar to PhantomJs. The fix will require Karma to use ChromeHeadless as the web browser instead of PhantomJs\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan test cases for ambari-web and it gives the desired

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nfix zeppelin cannot download interpreter dependencies issue.\r\nAfter zeppelin started, while configure zeppelin to access hive using jdbc interpreter, it report \"Error setting properties for interpreter 'jdbc.jdbc': Cannot fetch dependencies for org.apache.hive:hive-jdbc:3.1.3\".\r\n\r\nCheckout the ownership of directory and found:\r\n1. /usr/bigtop/3.2.0/usr/lib/zeppelin, this dir's owner is zeppelin:zeppelin\r\n2. /usr/bigtop/3.2.0/usr/lib/zeppelin, the owner of subdirectories and files  is root:root\r\n3. While the owner of zeppelin process is zeppelin.\r\n4. Normally, zeppelin need to download interpreter dependencies to local-repo, and it's default location is /usr/bigtop/3.2.0/usr/lib/zeppelin/local-repo.\r\n5. Due to the ownership, zeppelin cannot save these dependency files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\nlocal manual test\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/How+to+Contribute) before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request ?\r\nSubprocess module allows us to execute command on the shell but usage of shell=true poses a security risk where user inputs with \"rm -rf\" can cause terrible things.\r\n\r\nTo avoid shell-injection vulnerabilities, subprocess can be used without shell=true, by modifying the way input is passed.\r\nSome of the examples can be found like - https://security.openstack.org/guidelines/dg_avoid-shell-true.html\r\n\r\nHence, shell=false is changed in most of the places wherever shell=True is used and command is converted to a list of strings by using shlex module.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch is manually tested by making changes on a existing cluster and restarting the appropriate services. Did not observe any failure in Ambari server or agent. All services were working as expected.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-25T17:39:30Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T21:11:40Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e26a651984af69f819cce9ba675f55652965bad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/3729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/3729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/statuses/714e7bb87c7bc7b49aa8243a91102acc49794281","head":{"label":"lingarajg:branch-2.7-AMBARI-25942","ref":"branch-2.7-AMBARI-25942","sha":"714e7bb87c7bc7b49aa8243a91102acc49794281","user":{"login":"lingarajg","id":3984818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg","html_url":"https://github.com/lingarajg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":670719877,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ_pfhQ","name":"ambari","full_name":"lingarajg/ambari","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lingarajg","id":3984818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg","html_url":"https://github.com/lingarajg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lingarajg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lingarajg/ambari","description":"Apache

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMain logic and changes of the commit:\r\n\r\nDesc:\r\n\r\nAmbari Ranger adaptation\r\nAmbari 2.8 uses bigtopstack 3.2.0, which corresponds to apache bigtop version 3.2.0\r\n\r\n1.All components lack corresponding ranger property files. Therefore, all ranger-related configuration files for all components are added.\r\n\r\n2.There is a lack of ranger integration, and here we integrate the ranger service. This ranger service is ported from hdp3.1.5's ranger service. The difference is that some initialization content in the install method is referenced to the /usr/bigtop/current directory, but this directory will only be linked with the \"bigtop-select distro-select set component version\" command in the post-hook after the install method is completed. Therefore, the initialization logic in the install method is moved to the configure method, and a mark file is set. Once the initialization is completed, a mark file is generated, and subsequent initialization will not be performed if the mark file exists.\r\n\r\n3. Bug fix for ranger advisor not working\r\nAfter integrating Ranger, most of the component advisors were not functioning properly due to the presence of ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/stack_advisor.py in the 2.8.0 branch.\r\nThe working logic of stack_advisor is such that ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/scripts/stack_advisor.py, as the starting point, loads all advisors, including stack_advisor.py and service_advisor.py under ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks directory.\r\nservice_advisor.py loads all service_advisor.py under each component directory and retrieves the recommended configuration, such as ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/HDFS/service_advisor.py, which contains all recommended HDFS configurations.\r\nHowever, in the 2.8.0 branch, ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/stack_advisor.py hardcodes to only return a few service advisors, causing all other component service advisors to not work properly.\r\nFurthermore, ambari/ambari-server/src/main/resources/stacks/BIGTOP/3.2.0/services/stack_advisor.py is redundant, and the configurations are scattered in each service advisor. Therefore, removing this file fixed the issue. The fix can be found in this PR: https://github.com/apache/ambari/pull/3677.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual test\r\nbefore enable kerberos all compoent works smoonthly\r\n\r\n

and registration\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe AgentRegisteringQueueChecker is an interceptor used during the long connection between the agent and server, mainly for requesting congestion control. It internally uses AgentsRegistrationQueue to store the sessionID of connections.\r\n\r\nThe sessionID is added to the AgentsRegistrationQueue when the ambari agent registers to the server or sends a heartbeat.\r\n\r\nWhen the long connection between the agent and server is disconnected, or when the server completes the heartbeat request, the sessionID is removed from the AgentsRegistrationQueue.\r\n\r\nWhen the queue is full, the server returns \"not allowed\" to the agent.\r\n\r\nAgentsRegistrationQueue uses ArrayBlockingQueue, which uses the same lock for both writing and consuming, making it easy to negatively impact performance when dealing with large clusters. Therefore, we are switching to using LinkedBlockingQueue in order to improve performance.\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nambari server supports closing ssl and communication with agent using http \r\nHowever, the function of using http to communicate with ambari server is not implemented in ambari agent.\r\n\r\nThe PR logic here is\r\n1. The agent detects the communication type, specifically http, ssl oneway, ssl twoway\r\n2. The agent and ambari server establish a corresponding type of websocker persistent connection according to the detection results. Among them, ssl twoway requires ambari agent to provide relevant certificate information, while http and ssl oneway do not need to verify the client, and do not need ssl option\r\n3. The ambari agent will use some http or https short connections to download resources and other operations, so it is necessary to construct a URL with the correct type of protocol.\r\n4. The netutil of ambari agent does not support http, add support\r\n5. In order to cooperate with the detection of whether to enable ssl, the server side needs to add the agent.ssl attribute in the /connecion_info interface.\r\n6. In the security filter, the server needs to determine whether to enable http to determine the filtering rules\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit tests and manual tests\r\n\r\nPlease review
