for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI was working on refactoring Connect proto tests from Catalyst DSL to DataFrame API, and identified that Join in Connect does not support `UsingColumns`. This is a gap between the Connect proto and DataFrame API. This also blocks the refactoring work because without `UsingColumns`, there is no compatible DataFrame Join API that we can covert existing tests to. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support for Join's `UsingColumns`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Improve API coverage.\r\n2. Unblock testing refactoring. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(This cherry-picks https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36801)\r\n\r\nWe added the support to query the `_metadata` column with a file-based streaming source: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35676. \r\n\r\nWe propose to use `transformUp` instead of `match` when pattern matching the `dataPlan` in `MicroBatchExecution` `runBatch` method in this PR. It is fine for `FileStreamSource` because `FileStreamSource` always returns one `LogicalRelation` node (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/FileStreamSource.scala#L247). \r\n\r\nBut the proposed change will make the logic robust and we really should not rely on the upstream source to return a desired plan. In addition, the proposed change could also make `_metadata` work if someone wants to customize `FileStreamSource` `getBatch`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRobust\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

SubqueryAlias/Project + Aggregate\r\n2. SubqueryAlias/Project + Filter + Aggregate\r\n3. SubqueryAlias/Project + LogicalPlan (maxRows <= 1)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/748fa2792e488a6b923b32e2898d9bb6e16fb4ca/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/CheckAnalysis.scala#L851-L856\r\n\r\nWe should support the thrid case in `splitSubquery` to avoid `Unexpected operator` exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix an issue with correlated subquery rewrite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2022-10-21T22:26:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T04:25:40Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T04:25:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"505340637e17143addc7715f988f1ce47b441f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f4cf74eb5b7e9e5aa6cd72829507338920b11b3","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-40862-split-subquery","ref":"spark-40862-split-subquery","sha":"7f4cf74eb5b7e9e5aa6cd72829507338920b11b3","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in broadcast handling `PythonRunner` when encryption is enabed. Due to this bug the following pyspark script:\r\n```\r\nbin/pyspark --conf spark.io.encryption.enabled=true\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nbar = {\"a\": \"aa\", \"b\": \"bb\"}\r\nfoo = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(bar)\r\nspark.udf.register(\"MYUDF\", lambda x: foo.value[x] if x else \"\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT MYUDF('a') AS a, MYUDF('b') AS b\").collect()\r\n```\r\nfails with:\r\n```\r\n22/10/21 17:14:32 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)/ 1]\r\norg.apache.spark.api.python.PythonException: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/petertoth/git/apache/spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/worker.py\", line 811, in main\r\n    func, profiler, deserializer, serializer = read_command(pickleSer, infile)\r\n  File \"/Users/petertoth/git/apache/spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/worker.py\", line 87, in read_command\r\n    command = serializer._read_with_length(file)\r\n  File \"/Users/petertoth/git/apache/spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 173, in _read_with_length\r\n    return self.loads(obj)\r\n  File \"/Users/petertoth/git/apache/spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 471, in loads\r\n    return cloudpickle.loads(obj, encoding=encoding)\r\nEOFError: Ran out of input\r\n```\r\nThe reason for this failure is that we have multiple Python UDF referencing the same broadcast and in the current code:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/748fa2792e488a6b923b32e2898d9bb6e16fb4ca/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/python/PythonRunner.scala#L385-L420\r\nthe number of broadcasts (`cnt`) is correct (1) but the broadcast id is serialized 2 times from JVM to Python ruining the next item that Python expects from JVM side.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the example above works in Spark 3.3 without this fix. That is because https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36121 in Spark 3.4 modified `ExpressionSet` and so `udfs` in `ExtractPythonUDFs`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/748fa2792e488a6b923b32e2898d9bb6e16fb4ca/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/python/ExtractPythonUDFs.scala#L239-L242\r\nchanged from `Stream` to `Vector`. When `broadcastVars` (and so `idsAndFiles`) is a `Stream` the example accidentaly works as the broadcast id is written to `dataOut` once (`oldBids.add(id)` in `idsAndFiles.foreach` is called before the 2nd item is calculated in `broadcastVars.flatMap`). But that doesn't mean that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36121 introduced the regression as `EncryptedPythonBroadcastServer` shouldn't serve the broadcast data 2 times (which `EncryptedPythonBroadcastServer` does now, but it is not noticed) as it could fail other cases when there are more than 1 broadcast used in UDFs). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-21T15:44:13Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T01:30:12Z","closed_at":"2022-10-22T01:39:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79c4fc18429dc94299fe0fa002ae78eefa2f53b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f9601f9768aabcdef95c88dcc32943ffc35571a","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-40874-fix-broadcasts-in-python-udf","ref":"SPARK-40874-fix-broadcasts-in-python-udf","sha":"1f9601f9768aabcdef95c88dcc32943ffc35571a","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor bucket tables with huge size, lots of partitions maybe generated if bucketed scan disabled by sql planner. \r\n\r\nWe can add one limit(default as BUCKETING_MAX_BUCKETS) to reduce the partitions for non-bucketed scan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid too many tasks introduced in single stage.\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7522130/197170079-35ee13f2-1d6c-425b-bfdd-5c4ac3c8297c.png)\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7522130/197170156-556f839b-8fde-4f29-862b-5a6d90bd0a8e.png)\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a corner-case regression caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36625. Users may have existing views that have invalid locations due to historical reasons. The location is actually useless for a view, but after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36625 , they start to fail to read the view as qualifying the location fails. We should just skip qualifying view locations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid regression\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nSpark can read view with invalid location again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nmanually test. View with an invalid location is kind of \"broken\" and can't be dropped (HMS fails to drop it), so we can't write a UT for it.","created_at":"2022-10-20T12:46:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T22:16:43Z","closed_at":"2022-10-20T22:16:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff19b23758f00889dd38f18e607bb1f53d95c5cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38321/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38321/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38321/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47a10e655c2b83153150e96cc236aa6c2ed8a25f","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:follow","ref":"follow","sha":"47a10e655c2b83153150e96cc236aa6c2ed8a25f","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo be able to modify the incoming requests for the Spark Connect GRPC service, for example to be able to translate metadata from the HTTP/2 request to values in the proto message the GRPC service needs to be configured using an interceptor.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds two ways to configure interceptors for the GRPC service. First, we can now configure interceptors in the `SparkConnectInterceptorRegistry` by adding a value to the `interceptorChain` like in the example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject SparkConnectInterceptorRegistry {\r\n\r\n  // Contains the list of configured interceptors.\r\n  private lazy val interceptorChain: Seq[InterceptorBuilder] = Seq(\r\n    interceptor[LoggingInterceptor](classOf[LoggingInterceptor])\r\n  )\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second way to configure interceptors is by configuring them using Spark configuration values at startup. Therefore a new config key has been added called: `spark.connect.grpc.interceptor.classes`. This config value contains a comma-separated list of classes that are added as interceptors to the system.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.connect.grpc.interceptor.classes=com.my.important.LoggingInterceptor\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring startup all of the interceptors are added in order to the `NettyServerBuilder`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Add all registered interceptors to the server builder.\r\nSparkConnectInterceptorRegistry.chainInterceptors(sb)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide a configurable and extensible way to configure interceptors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit Tests\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-20T11:50:19Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T21:25:04Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T15:09:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"145b07b97dcc557bdc60fa18a73ff7e189a48a97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0817329d2b4e777b425e9dab02b5def4ef11cec8","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:SPARK-40857","ref":"SPARK-40857","sha":"0817329d2b4e777b425e9dab02b5def4ef11cec8","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPurging old entries in both the offset log and commit log will be done asynchronously.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor every micro-batch, older entries in both offset log and commit log are deleted. This is done so that the offset log and commit log do not continually grow.  Please reference logic here\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/MicroBatchExecution.scala#L539 \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe time spent performing these log purges is grouped with the “walCommit” execution time in the StreamingProgressListener metrics.  Around two thirds of the “walCommit” execution time is performing these purge operations thus making these operations asynchronous will also reduce latency.  Also, we do not necessarily need to perform the purges every micro-batch.  When these purges are executed asynchronously, they do not need to block micro-batch execution and we don’t need to start another purge until the current one is finished.  The purges can happen essentially in the background.  We will just have to synchronize the purges with the offset WAL commits and completion commits so that we don’t have concurrent modifications of the offset log and commit log.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDecrease microbatch processing latency\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nHandle `TimeUnit.NANOS` for parquet `Timestamps` addressing a regression in behaviour since 3.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince version 3.2 reading parquet files that contain attributes with type `TIMESTAMP(NANOS,true)` is not possible as ParquetSchemaConverter returns\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Illegal Parquet type: INT64 (TIMESTAMP(NANOS,true))\r\n```\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34661 introduced a change matching on the `LogicalTypeAnnotation` which only covers Timestamp cases for `TimeUnit.MILLIS` and `TimeUnit.MICROS` meaning `TimeUnit.NANOS` would return `illegalType()`\r\n\r\nPrior to 3.2 the matching used the `originalType` which for `TIMESTAMP(NANOS,true)` return `null` and therefore resulted to a `LongType`, the change proposed is too consider `TimeUnit.NANOS` and return `LongType` making behaviour the same as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test covering this scenario.\r\nInternally deployed to read parquet files that contain

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to flip the default value of Kafka offset fetching config (`spark.sql.streaming.kafka.useDeprecatedOffsetFetching`) from `true` to `false`, which enables AdminClient based offset fetching by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe had been encountered several production issues with old offset fetching (e.g. hang, issue with Kafka consumer group rebalance) which could be mitigated with new offset fetching. Despite the breaking change on the ACL, there is no need for moderate users to suffer from the old way.\r\n\r\nThe discussion went through the dev. mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/thread/spkco94gw33sj8355mhlxz1vl7gl1g5c\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, especially users who relies on Kafka ACL based on consumer group. They need to either adjust the ACL to topic based one, or set the value to `true` for `spark.sql.streaming.kafka.useDeprecatedOffsetFetching` to use the old approach.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse event `SparkListenerSQLExecutionEnd` to track if the SQL/DataFrame is completion instead of using job status.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe SQL may succeed with some failed jobs. For example, a inner join with one empty side and one large side, the plan would finish and the large side is still running.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, correct the sql status in UI\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd test for backward compatibility and manually test\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (c1 int) USING

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR replace column names and columns type with a schema (which is a struct).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBefore this PR, AnalyzeResult separates column names and column types. However these two can be combined to form a schema which is a struct.  This PR will simplify that proto message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis documents that `groupBy(...).as[...]` should be preferred over `groupByKey(...)`.\r\n\r\nIt further provides shortcuts for `groupBy(...).as[...]` that make it easier to use column-based `groupByKey`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCalling `Dataset.groupBy(...).as[K, T]` should be preferred over calling `Dataset.groupByKey(...)` whenever possible. The former allows Catalyst to exploit existing partitioning and ordering of the Dataset, while the latter hides from Catalyst which columns are used to create the keys.\r\n\r\n_When the dataset is already partitioned and ordered by the grouping columns, `Dataset.groupByKey(...)` will repartition and order the entire dataset again._\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nCalling `ds.groupByKey(_.id)` hides from Catalyst that column `id` is the grouping key, while `ds.groupBy($\"id\").as[Int, V]` tells Catalyst that `ds` is to be grouped by (partitioned and ordered by) column `id`.\r\n\r\nThe new column-based `groupByKey` methods make it easier for users to find a way to express the grouping by expressions. Looking at the `Dataset` API, the user finds `groupByKey` with `Column`. The existing `groupBy` method returns a `RelationalGroupedDataset`, which provides the `as[K, V]` method, which allows for the same semantics, but is difficult to find.\r\n\r\nThe new column-based `groupByKey` methods further do not require the user to specify the type `V` of the original `Dataset[V]`, as `groupByKey` has access to the type / encoder:\r\n\r\n    ds.groupBy($\"id\").as[Int, V]\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\r\n    ds.groupByKey[Int]($\"id\")\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n**Note: This breaks compilation when function name is used with existing `groupByKey`:**\r\n\r\nWas:\r\n\r\n    groupByKey(identity)\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n    groupByKey(identity(_))\r\n\r\nIt adds these methods:\r\n\r\nScala:\r\n- `Dataset.groupByKey[K](Column, Column*)`\r\n- `Dataset.groupByKey[K](String, String*)`\r\n\r\nJava-specific methods cannot be added without introducing ambiguity.

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter [SPARK-29839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29839), we could create a table with specife based a existing view, but the serde of created is always parquet.\r\nHowever, if we use USING syntax  ([SPARK-29421](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29421)) to create a table with specified serde based a view, we can get the correct serde.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe should add specified serde for the created table when using `create table like view stored as` syntax.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds additional checkpoint rename file check.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe encountered an issue recently that one customer's structured streaming job failed to read delta file.\r\n\r\nThe temporary file exists but it was not successfully renamed to final delta file path.\r\n\r\nWe currently don't check if renamed file exists but assume it successful. As the result, failing to read delta file assumed to be committed in last batch makes re-triggering the job impossible.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to do a check against checkpoint renamed file to prevent such difficulty in advance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-10-18T03:18:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T02:18:10Z","closed_at":"2022-10-19T05:05:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3cbc5ba16754389fbd2af9772da2597a44ed27b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a window_time function to extract streaming event time from a window column produced by the window aggregating operators. This is one step in sequence of fixes required to add support for multiple stateful operators in Spark Structured Streaming as described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40821\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe window_time function is a convenience function to compute correct event time for a window aggregate records. Such records produced by window aggregating operators have no explicit event time but rather a window column of type StructType { start: TimestampType, end: TimestampType } where start is inclusive and end is exclusive. The correct event time for such record is window.end - 1. The event time is necessary when chaining other stateful operators after the window aggregating operators. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes: The PR introduces a new window_time SQL function for both Scala and Python APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests.","created_at":"2022-10-17T21:40:27Z","updated_at":"2022-12-27T13:30:44Z","closed_at":"2022-10-23T23:12:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b91342e48a4ba0cc042358c3c65cad678de875f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5236f5d760e865572b274ed96971fb826e3989d6","head":{"label":"alex-balikov:SPARK-40821-time-window","ref":"SPARK-40821-time-window","sha":"5236f5d760e865572b274ed96971fb826e3989d6","user":{"login":"alex-balikov","id":91913242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXp8Gg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91913242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-balikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467787380,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-HedA","name":"spark","full_name":"alex-balikov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alex-balikov","id":91913242,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXp8Gg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91913242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-balikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-balikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alex-balikov/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for compiled Java classes to Protobuf functions. This is tested with Protobuf v3 classes. V2 vs V3 issues will be handled in a separate PR. The main changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n - Changes to top level API:\r\n    - Adds new version that takes just the class name.\r\n    - Changes the order of arguments for existing API with descriptor files (`messageName` and `descFilePath` are swapped).\r\n - Protobuf utils methods to create descriptor from Java class name. \r\n - Many unit tests are update to check both versions : (1) with descriptor file and (2) with Java class name.\r\n - Maven build updates to generate Java classes to use in tests.\r\n - Miscellaneous changes:\r\n    - Adds `proto` to package name in `proto` files used in tests.\r\n    - A few TODO comments about improvements \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJava compiled classes is a common method for users to provide Protobuf definitions. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nThis updates interface, but for a new feature in active development. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n - Unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-17T17:13:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T16:21:28Z","closed_at":"2022-10-21T06:47:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0be5046cf78bcadc570b3cfbe19f21c101759fcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20250312710e0dbf44964ea98a9e064ec657d8a7","head":{"label":"rangadi:protobuf-java","ref":"protobuf-java","sha":"20250312710e0dbf44964ea98a9e064ec657d8a7","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235638810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2Mzg4MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"rangadi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis moves look up of the `IO_COMPRESSION_LZ4_BLOCKSIZE` and `IO_COMPRESSION_SNAPPY_BLOCKSIZE` to the constructor instead of the method `compressedOutputStream`. This is already how it done for `IO_COMPRESSION_ZSTD_BUFFERSIZE` in `ZStdCompressionCodec`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe cost of looking up the config is often insignificant, but

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `collect` method in `class LogicalPlan` is really to generate connect proto plan. It's confusing to use `collect` which overlaps with `collect` in dataframe API that returns materialized data.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename this method to `to_proto` to match its implementation. \r\n  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove codebase readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-10-17T05:04:59Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T01:13:16Z","closed_at":"2022-10-19T01:13:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08798a6e0e2fc963da92140c401a3f4b924fb95e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a78fda1b66bbb8c7d34bfacf36318c1ad6c3239","head":{"label":"amaliujia:rename_logical_plan_collect2","ref":"rename_logical_plan_collect2","sha":"7a78fda1b66bbb8c7d34bfacf36318c1ad6c3239","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434752466,"node_id":"R_kgDOGenL0g","name":"spark","full_name":"amaliujia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31909. In the original PR, `spark.hadoopRDD.ignoreEmptySplits` was enabled due to seemingly no side-effects, however, this change breaks `SymlinkTextInputFormat` so any table that uses the input format would return empty results.\r\n\r\nThis is due to a combination of problems:\r\n1. Incorrect implementation of [SymlinkTextInputSplit](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/SymlinkTextInputFormat.java#L73). The input format does not set `start` and `length` fields from the target split. `SymlinkTextInputSplit` is an abstraction over FileSplit and all downstream systems treat it as such - those fields should be extracted and passed from the target split.\r\n2. `spark.hadoopRDD.ignoreEmptySplits` being enabled causes HadoopRDD to filter out all of the empty splits which does not work in the case of SymlinkTextInputFormat. This is due to 1. Because we don't set any length (and start) those splits are considered to be empty and are removed from the final list of partitions even though the target splits themselves are non-empty.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this needs to be addressed in Hive but I figured it would be much faster to fix this in Spark.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces `DelegateSymlinkTextInputFormat` that wraps SymlinkTextInputFormat and provides splits with the correct start and length attributes. This is controlled by `spark.sql.hive.useDelegateForSymlinkTextInputFormat` which is enabled by default. When disabled, the user-provided SymlinkTextInputFormat will be used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a correctness issue when using `SymlinkTextInputSplit` in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test that reproduces the issue and verified that it passes with the fix.","created_at":"2022-10-17T03:44:33Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T06:54:33Z","closed_at":"2022-10-31T23:34:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d70c7290d5b883f86a2a585c29d25a5edcfb57f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38277/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38277/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38277/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b65a2c283c42f9f1b659ea3cd49de6446d60181c","head":{"label":"sadikovi:fix-symlink-input-format","ref":"fix-symlink-input-format","sha":"b65a2c283c42f9f1b659ea3cd49de6446d60181c","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR supports `Deduplicate` to Connect proto and DSL.\r\n\r\nNote that `Deduplicate` can not be replaced by SQL's `SELECT DISTINCT col_list`. The difference is that `Deduplicate` allows to remove duplicated rows based on a set of columns but returns all the columns. SQL's `SELECT DISTINCT col_list`, instead, can only return the `col_list`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. To improve proto API coverage.\r\n2. `Deduplicate` blocks https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38166 because we want support `Union(isAll=false)` but that will return `Union().Distinct()` to match existing DataFrame API. `Deduplicate` is needed to write test cases for `Union(isAll=false)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-10-16T21:42:07Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T03:01:03Z","closed_at":"2022-10-21T05:14:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c66d4463d94a350a722b0ee66f972cff469e213","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38276/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38276/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38276/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9110226a5b9ab2e5cde37de834d70936aad84a65","head":{"label":"amaliujia:supportDropDuplicates","ref":"supportDropDuplicates","sha":"9110226a5b9ab2e5cde37de834d70936aad84a65","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434752466,"node_id":"R_kgDOGenL0g","name":"spark","full_name":"amaliujia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch changes the way simple scalar built-in functions are resolved in the Python Spark Connect client. Previously, it was trying to manually load specific functions. With the changes in this patch, the trivial binary operators like `<`, `+`, ... are mapped to their name equivalents in Spark so that the dynamic function lookup works.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it cleans up the Scala planner side to remove the now unnecessary code translating the trivial binary expressions into their equivalent functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently `RenameTableExec` only handles an empty namespace for destination tables as the following current spec:\r\n\r\n(3.3.0 is picked up) https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.3.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/v2/RenameTableExec.scala#L48\r\n\r\n```\r\n# L48\r\n    val qualifiedNewIdent = if (newIdent.namespace.isEmpty) {\r\n      Identifier.of(oldIdent.namespace, newIdent.name)\r\n    } else newIdent\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis part doesn't handle the case where a destination table is specified catalog.db.table. If catalog.db.table is passed to `ALTER TABLE <src> RENAME TO <dst>` query, there's a difference of handling namespaces between source and destination tables. Specifically, source tables can be correctly handled as `[db]` for its namespace, but destination tables are handled as `[catalog, db]` for its namespace.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change provide handling destination names that include catalog name as `catalog.db.table`.  \r\nFor example, Apache Iceberg is expected to handle the destination table as catalog.db.table in the document; [https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-ddl/#alter-table--rename-to](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-ddl/#alter-table--rename-to.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Keep the compatibility with the current spec.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAn unit test is added. The test checks whether renaming table name is successful or not if dst for ALTER TABLE RENAME TO has catalog name as `ALTER TABLE src RENAME TO catalog.db.table`.\r\n\r\n(New) test results:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRun starting.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to port the following tests suites onto `checkError` to check valuable error parts instead of error messages:\r\n- JDBCWriteSuite\r\n- JDBCTableCatalogSuite\r\n- JdbcUtilsSuite\r\n- CreateTableAsSelectSuite\r\n- SparkScriptTransformationSuite\r\n- SQLViewSuite\r\n- InsertSuite\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMigration on `checkError()` will make the tests independent from the text of error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SQLViewSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBefore this PR, connect proto defines the UnresolvedRelation as\r\n```\r\n  message NamedTable {\r\n    repeated string parts = 1;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwhich asked clients to provide multiple name parts of the relation. For example, user could offer `a.b.c.d` as the table name. However, this actually asks clients to implement `CatalystSqlParser.parseMultipartIdentifier`.  The problem to clients is they cannot access the catalyst parser thus needs to re-invent the wheel. Another problem is clients might not be able to implement the parsing correctly.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the proto to \r\n```\r\n  message NamedTable {\r\n    string unparsed_identifier = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich only needs clients to provide the user's table name. Server side as it can access catalyst, can parse the identifier.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes on the Column identifier accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis proposal reduced the required work on the client side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR modifies the optimizer rule `OptimizeOneRowRelationSubquery` to always collapse projects and inline non-volatile expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-39699 made `CollpaseProjects` more conservative. This has impacted correlated subqueries that Spark used to be able to support. For example, Spark used to be able to execute this correlated subquery:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (\r\n  SELECT array_sort(a, (i, j) -> rank[i] - rank[j]) AS sorted\r\n  FROM (SELECT MAP('a', 1, 'b', 2) rank)\r\n) FROM t1\r\n```\r\nBut after SPARK-39699, it will throw an exception `Unexpected operator Join Inner` because the projects inside the subquery can no longer be collapsed. We should always inline expressions if possible to support a broader range of correlated subqueries and avoid adding expensive domain joins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. It will allow Spark to execute more types of correlated subqueries.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nextract the check insertion field cast methold so that we can do validate patition value at PartitioningUtils.normalizePartitionSpec\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nInsertion follow the behavior of config `spark.sql.storeAssignmentPolicy`, which will fail if the value can not cast to target data type by default. Alter partition should also follow it. For example:\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE t (c int) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY(p int);\r\n\r\n-- This DDL should fail but worked:\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION(p='aaa'); \r\n\r\n-- FAILED which follows spark.sql.storeAssignmentPolicy\r\nINSERT INTO t PARTITION(p='aaa') SELECT 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes,  the added partition value will follow the behavior of  `storeAssignmentPolicy`.\r\n\r\nTo restore the previous behavior, set spark.sql.legacy.skipPartitionSpecTypeValidation = true;\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the error message when referencing a \".\" separated attribute that does not exist in the table. For example,\r\n```scala\r\nSeq((0)).toDF(\"the.id\").select(\"the.id\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould throw an error with the invalid suggestion:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter\r\n with name `the`.`id` cannot be resolved. Did you mean one of the following? [`the`.`id`];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be showing `the.id` instead of `the`.`id`: \r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter\r\n with name `the`.`id` cannot be resolved. Did you mean one of the following? [`the.id`];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is due to to `toSQLId` function that parses the attribute name again, after it has already been qualified. The method splits the name by dots and qualifies each individual part which is incorrect.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in reporting attribute names for the `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION` error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the user should see the correct message now when the table contains columns with \".\" separators.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2022-10-14T07:08:16Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T08:17:05Z","closed_at":"2022-10-14T08:17:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dffc031410556167956d873e1b0172ce539da61a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c1e4561c3eb72c30f6fefe3cc4b451146a85274","head":{"label":"sadikovi:SPARK-39783","ref":"SPARK-39783","sha":"7c1e4561c3eb72c30f6fefe3cc4b451146a85274","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using the scalafmt.conf file as provided by the project repository to organize and optimize imports there is a case in which un-desired behavior appears.\r\n\r\nIf the import group does not fit on a single line, Scalafmt will by default try to bin-pack and then break out over mulitple lines.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.{UnresolvedAlias, UnresolvedAttribute, UnresolvedFunction, UnresolvedRelation, UnresolvedStar}\r\n\r\nwill become\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.{\r\n      UnresolvedAlias,\r\n      UnresolvedAttributed,\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn previous code reviews this has been marked as departing from the consistency of the Spark code base. This patch enables an option in Scalafmt to force the import group on a single line even if it exceeds the max line length.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!
