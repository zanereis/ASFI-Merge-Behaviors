This rule is loosely based on the SEI CERT rule *OBJ01-J Limit accessibility of fields*. ([#OBJ01-J](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/OBJ01-J.+Limit+accessibility+of+fields))\n-   Extend `SerializableIdiom` detector with new bug type: `SE_PREVENT_EXT_OBJ_OVERWRITE`. It's reported in case of the `readExternal()` method allows any caller to reset any value of an object\n-   New Detector `FindVulnerableSecurityCheckMethods` for new bug type `VSC_VULNERABLE_SECURITY_CHECK_METHODS`. This bug is reported whenever a non-final and non-private method of a non-final class performs a security check using the `java.lang.SecurityManager`. (See \\[SEI CERT MET03-J] (https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/MET03-J.+Methods+that+perform+a+security+check+must+be+declared+private+or+final))\n-   New function added to detector `SynchronizationOnSharedBuiltinConstant`to detect `DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_INTERNED_STRING` ([#&#8203;2266](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2266))\n-   Make TypeQualifierResolver recognize org.apache.avro.reflect.Nullable ([#&#8203;2066](https://togithub.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/pull/2066))\n-   New detector `FindArgumentAssertions` detecting bug `ASSERTION_OF_ARGUMENTS` in case of validation of arguments of public functions using assertions (See [MET01-J.

Description\r\n\r\nIn nutshell the problem was that that the loan cob catchup job was two days behind therefore it had to run two consecutive jobs which are executed sequentially. The testcase was polling the state of the job every 5 seconds to check if the inline cob finished or not. In same cases this request was made between the two job executions and at that point (indeed) no inline cob was running, so the testcase went to the verification, but the loan was not yet closed by the second job yet. \r\n\r\nRepro steps: decrease the wait interval to 10ms...\r\n\r\nThe improved solution waits until the COB is not running anymore and queries the GetOldestCOBProcessedLoanResponse to figure out the last processed COB date. If both are OK, then the test can proceed to the verification of the loan. \r\n\r\nIgnore if these details are present on the associated [Apache Fineract JIRA ticket](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1284).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [ ] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [ ] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/legacy-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Submission is not a \"code dump\".

Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass `--release 11` to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime. If you have feedback, please comment on [#&#8203;3803](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803).\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`ClosingStandardOutputStreams`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ClosingStandardOutputStreams): Prevents accidentally closing `System.{out,err}` with try-with-resources\n-   [`TruthContainsExactlyElementsInUsage`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TruthContainsExactlyElementsInUsage): `containsExactly` is preferred over `containsExactlyElementsIn` when creating new iterables\n-   [`UnnecessaryAsync`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnnecessaryAsync): detects unnecessary use of async primitives in local (and hence single-threaded) scopes\n-   [`ReturnAtTheEndOfVoidFunction`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ReturnAtTheEndOfVoidFunction): detects unnecessary `return` statements at the end of `void` functions\n-   [`MultimapKeys`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MultimapKeys): Suggests using `keySet()` instead of iterating over `Multimap.keys()`, which does not collapse duplicates\n\nBug fixes and improvements:\n\n-   Don't complain about literal IP addresses in `AddressSelection` (https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/44b65527debbc57892f21ca3ba458b16771e423e)\n-   Prevent SuggestedFixes#renameMethod from modifying return type declaration ([#&#8203;4043](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4043))\n-   Fix UnusedVariable false positives for private record parameters ([#&#8203;2713](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2713))\n-   When running in conservative mode, no longer assume that implementations of `Map.get`, etc. return `null` ([#&#8203;2910](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2910))\n-   CanIgnoreReturnValueSuggester: Support additional exempting method annotations ([#&#8203;4009](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4009))\n-   UnusedVariable: exclude junit5's `@RegisterExtension` ([#&#8203;3892](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3892))\n-   Support running all available patch checks ([#&#8203;947](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/947))\n-   Upgrade java-diff-utils 4.0 -> 4.12 ([#&#8203;4081](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4081))\n-   Flag unused Refaster template parameters ([#&#8203;4060](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4060))\n-   Support `@SuppressWarnings(\"all\")` ([#&#8203;4065](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4065))\n-   Prevent Refaster `UMemberSelect` from matching method parameters ([#&#8203;2456](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2456))\n-   MissingDefault : Don't require `// fall out` comments on expression switches ([#&#8203;2709](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2709))\n-   Skip UnnecessaryLambda findings for usages in enhanced for loops ([#&#8203;2518](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2518))\n-   Fix bug where nested MissingBraces violations' suggested fixes result in broken code ([#&#8203;3797](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3797))\n-   Add support for specifying `exemptPrefixes`/`exemptNames` for UnusedVariable via flags ([#&#8203;2753](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2753))\n-   UnusedMethod: Added exempting variable annotations ([#&#8203;2881](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2881))\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.21.1...v2.22.0\n\n### [`v2.21.1`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.21.1): Error Prone 2.21.1\n\nChanges:\n\n-   Handle overlapping ranges in suppressedRegions (fixes [#&#8203;4040](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4040))\n-   Add [` AddressSelection  `](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AddressSelection) to discourage APIs that convert a hostname to a single address\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.21.0...v2.21.1\n\n### [`v2.21.0`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.21.0): Error Prone 2.21.0\n\nNew Checkers:\n\n-   [`AttemptedNegativeZero`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AttemptedNegativeZero): Prevents accidental use of `-0`, which is the same as `0`.

If you aren’t using WireMock 2.35.0, upgrade to this version first\n2.  If you use WireMock Standalone, backup your configurations, logs and other information you might need in the future, just in case the - upgrade goes wrong\n3.  If you use the WireMock Webhooks Extension, delete the dependency on it and the downloads. Now the extension is a part of the WireMock core\n4.  If you use any WireMock extensions, private source or open source ones, ensure they are compatible with WireMock 3 by checking this [GitHub Issue](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323), documentation and the integration tests.  If you discover any incompatible extension, please raise a bug in \\[wiremock/wiremock/issues (https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues) or comment in [wiremock/wiremock #&#8203;2323](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323), We will triage and route it accordingly\n5.  If you use Java 8 on the instance, update to Java 11 or Java 17\n6.

WireMock Webhook Extension 3.0.0 JAR is broken [#&#8203;2342](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2342). Also, the 2.35.0 build of the extension is not compatible with WireMock 3.0.0 as reported in [#&#8203;2341](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2341). This extension cannot be reliably used until a new patch is released\n-   \\[ ] Some other WireMock 2 exceptions are not compatible with WireMock 3 and need an update. See the [WireMock 3 extension compatibility notes](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323) in [#&#8203;2323](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323)\n-   \\[x] **FIXED in 3.0.1** - `StopAction` in the old V1 Filter extension implementation was not working as expected - fixed by [@&#8203;Mahoney](https://togithub.com/Mahoney) in [#&#8203;2335](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2335)\n-   \\[x] **FIXED in 3.0.2** - Help printing fails in WireMock standalone - fixed by [@&#8203;tomasbjerre](https://togithub.com/tomasbjerre) in 3.0.2 [#&#8203;2351](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2351)\n\nThis list will be expanded when we find new issues\n\n#### 💥 Breaking changes\n\n-   Java 8 is no longer supported, WireMock will NOT work on this version anymore\n-   Upgrade from Jetty 9 to Jetty 11 ([Changelog](https://togithub.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases)) [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Change the Maven repository groupID to org.wiremock for all artifacts built from this repository: [wiremock](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock), [wiremock-standalone](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock-standalone), [wiremock-webhooks-extension](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock-webhooks-extension/) [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Change Artifact IDs of `wiremock-jre8` and `wiremock-jre8-standalone` to  `wiremock` and `wiremock-standalone` [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Change the standalone CLI entrypoint from `com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.standalone.WireMockServerRunner` to `wiremock.Run` ([166c3b3](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/commit/166c3b3586c57aece86a1b5744a1cb2d19c6f690)) [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Starting from WireMock **3.1.0**, the Webhooks extension is included into the main distribution, and hence enabled by default. Users should remove dependency on the extension when upgrading to this version\n-   Almost all Guava usages in public binary APIs were replaced by Java 11 equivalents. The rest will be removed in the WireMock 4 release in the future.

It is now entirely configured via startup options and customised via the extension interface so `ResponseTemplateTransformer` should no longer be constructed directly. 2.x code constructing `ResponseTemplateTransformer` will no longer compile so should be removed or migrated to the 3.x style - See [#&#8203;2349](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2349) for detail\n\nPlease note the the legacy recorder has now been deprecated ([7b8a7d](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/commit/7b8a7d351255342d8d22cb5217b6847cc8ddaa29). It will removed in WireMock 4 [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n\nPlease also note that some APIs remain in the Beta state, and there might be some breaking changes within major releases. We will be adding more annotations in the next release to make it explicit.\n\n#### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n-   Shadow additional packages in wiremock-standalone

2.23.0\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`DuplicateDateFormatField`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DuplicateDateFormatField)\n-   [`NonFinalStaticField`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/NonFinalStaticField)\n-   [`StringCharset`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/StringCharset)\n-   [`StringFormatWithLiteral`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/StringFormatWithLiteral)\n-   [`SuperEqualsIsObjectEquals`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/SuperEqualsIsObjectEquals)\n\nBug fixes and improvements: [#&#8203;3897](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3897), [#&#8203;4114](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4114),

[`v2.22.0`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.22.0): Error Prone 2.22.0\n\nWe are considering raising the minimum supported JDK from JDK 11 to JDK 17 in a future release of Error Prone, see [#&#8203;3803](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803). Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass `--release 11` to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime. If you have feedback, please comment on [#&#8203;3803](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803).\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`ClosingStandardOutputStreams`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ClosingStandardOutputStreams): Prevents accidentally closing `System.{out,err}` with try-with-resources\n-   [`TruthContainsExactlyElementsInUsage`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TruthContainsExactlyElementsInUsage): `containsExactly` is preferred over `containsExactlyElementsIn` when creating new iterables\n-   [`UnnecessaryAsync`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnnecessaryAsync): detects unnecessary use of async primitives in local (and hence single-threaded) scopes\n-   [`ReturnAtTheEndOfVoidFunction`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ReturnAtTheEndOfVoidFunction): detects unnecessary `return` statements at the end of `void` functions\n-   [`MultimapKeys`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MultimapKeys): Suggests using `keySet()` instead of iterating over `Multimap.keys()`, which does not collapse duplicates\n\nBug fixes and improvements:\n\n-   Don't complain about literal IP addresses in `AddressSelection` (https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/44b65527debbc57892f21ca3ba458b16771e423e)\n-   Prevent SuggestedFixes#renameMethod from modifying return type declaration ([#&#8203;4043](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4043))\n-   Fix UnusedVariable false positives for private record parameters ([#&#8203;2713](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2713))\n-   When running in conservative mode, no longer assume that implementations of `Map.get`, etc. return `null` ([#&#8203;2910](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2910))\n-   CanIgnoreReturnValueSuggester: Support additional exempting method annotations ([#&#8203;4009](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4009))\n-   UnusedVariable: exclude junit5's `@RegisterExtension` ([#&#8203;3892](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3892))\n-   Support running all available patch checks ([#&#8203;947](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/947))\n-   Upgrade java-diff-utils 4.0 -> 4.12 ([#&#8203;4081](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4081))\n-   Flag unused Refaster template parameters ([#&#8203;4060](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4060))\n-   Support `@SuppressWarnings(\"all\")` ([#&#8203;4065](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4065))\n-   Prevent Refaster `UMemberSelect` from matching method parameters ([#&#8203;2456](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2456))\n-   MissingDefault : Don't require `// fall out` comments on expression switches ([#&#8203;2709](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2709))\n-   Skip UnnecessaryLambda findings for usages in enhanced for loops ([#&#8203;2518](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2518))\n-   Fix bug where nested MissingBraces violations' suggested fixes result in broken code ([#&#8203;3797](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/3797))\n-   Add support for specifying `exemptPrefixes`/`exemptNames` for UnusedVariable via flags ([#&#8203;2753](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2753))\n-   UnusedMethod: Added exempting variable annotations ([#&#8203;2881](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/2881))\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.21.1...v2.22.0\n\n### [`v2.21.1`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.21.1): Error Prone 2.21.1\n\nChanges:\n\n-   Handle overlapping ranges in suppressedRegions (fixes [#&#8203;4040](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/issues/4040))\n-   Add [` AddressSelection  `](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AddressSelection) to discourage APIs that convert a hostname to a single address\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.21.0...v2.21.1\n\n### [`v2.21.0`](https://togithub.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.21.0): Error Prone 2.21.0\n\nNew Checkers:\n\n-   [`AttemptedNegativeZero`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AttemptedNegativeZero): Prevents accidental use of `-0`, which is the same as `0`.

Please be careful when updating, and see the Errata below\n\n#### Upgrade guide\n\nThis guide assumes you would be upgrading from WireMock 2.35.0 to 3.1.0\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Show steps</summary>\n\n1.  If you aren’t using WireMock 2.35.0, upgrade to this version first\n2.  If you use WireMock Standalone, backup your configurations, logs and other information you might need in the future, just in case the - upgrade goes wrong\n3.  If you use the WireMock Webhooks Extension, delete the dependency on it and the downloads. Now the extension is a part of the WireMock core\n4.  If you use any WireMock extensions, private source or open source ones, ensure they are compatible with WireMock 3 by checking this [GitHub Issue](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323), documentation and the integration tests.

WireMock Webhook Extension 3.0.0 JAR is broken [#&#8203;2342](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2342). Also, the 2.35.0 build of the extension is not compatible with WireMock 3.0.0 as reported in [#&#8203;2341](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2341). This extension cannot be reliably used until a new patch is released\n-   \\[ ] Some other WireMock 2 exceptions are not compatible with WireMock 3 and need an update. See the [WireMock 3 extension compatibility notes](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323) in [#&#8203;2323](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2323)\n-   \\[x] **FIXED in 3.0.1** - `StopAction` in the old V1 Filter extension implementation was not working as expected - fixed by [@&#8203;Mahoney](https://togithub.com/Mahoney) in [#&#8203;2335](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2335)\n-   \\[x] **FIXED in 3.0.2** - Help printing fails in WireMock standalone - fixed by [@&#8203;tomasbjerre](https://togithub.com/tomasbjerre) in 3.0.2 [#&#8203;2351](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2351)\n\nThis list will be expanded when we find new issues\n\n#### 💥 Breaking changes\n\n-   Java 8 is no longer supported, WireMock will NOT work on this version anymore\n-   Upgrade from Jetty 9 to Jetty 11 ([Changelog](https://togithub.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases)) [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Change the Maven repository groupID to org.wiremock for all artifacts built from this repository: [wiremock](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock), [wiremock-standalone](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock-standalone), [wiremock-webhooks-extension](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock-webhooks-extension/) [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Change Artifact IDs of `wiremock-jre8` and `wiremock-jre8-standalone` to  `wiremock` and `wiremock-standalone` [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Change the standalone CLI entrypoint from `com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.standalone.WireMockServerRunner` to `wiremock.Run` ([166c3b3](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/commit/166c3b3586c57aece86a1b5744a1cb2d19c6f690)) [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n-   Starting from WireMock **3.1.0**, the Webhooks extension is included into the main distribution, and hence enabled by default. Users should remove dependency on the extension when upgrading to this version\n-   Almost all Guava usages in public binary APIs were replaced by Java 11 equivalents. The rest will be removed in the WireMock 4 release in the future.

It is now entirely configured via startup options and customised via the extension interface so `ResponseTemplateTransformer` should no longer be constructed directly. 2.x code constructing `ResponseTemplateTransformer` will no longer compile so should be removed or migrated to the 3.x style - See [#&#8203;2349](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/issues/2349) for detail\n\nPlease note the the legacy recorder has now been deprecated ([7b8a7d](https://togithub.com/wiremock/wiremock/commit/7b8a7d351255342d8d22cb5217b6847cc8ddaa29). It will removed in WireMock 4 [@&#8203;tomakehurst](https://togithub.com/tomakehurst)\n\nPlease also note that some APIs remain in the Beta state, and there might be some breaking changes within major releases. We will be adding more annotations in the next release to make it explicit.\n\n#### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n-   Shadow additional packages in wiremock-standalone
