attributes of ``TaskInstance`` such as `operator` and `queue` are either not updated or only updated when when task is executed. \r\nThis causes some issues:\r\n- If a task is marked success or failed, the ``operator`` field is left as None. This causes bugs when some other code tries to use the ``operator`` field to find the name of the class.\r\n- When the `pool` or `queue` of a task is changed in the DAG definition, there is no way to re-run existing `TaskInstance` using the updated values. Clearing the `TaskInstance` does not update these attributes.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to copy ``TaskInstance`` from `Task` in a function `refresh_from_task()` consistently.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6704](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6704)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

This is done by examining the XCom data stored by ``SkipMixin.skip()`` or ``SkipMixin.skip_all_except()``.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is inspired by the author of [this blog](https://blog.diffractive.io/2018/08/07/replacement-shortcircuitoperator-for-airflow/).\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-5391](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5391)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

switching to `os.fork()` for the task runner, there is the possibility that exceptions queued by Sentry will not be emitted prior to the process exiting.\r\n\r\nThis fixes AIRFLOW-6569 by explicitly flushing pending exceptions prior to calling `os._exit()` within the forked task runner.\r\n\r\nThis is covered by existing unit tests within

change allows Airflow users to utilise their own custom Statsd client as discussed [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6530).\r\n\r\nMany companies have their own custom Statsd clients and this change should allow for easier adoption of Airflow by large corporations.\r\n\r\nExample usage based off of this change:\r\n\r\n1) User adds a module path to their airflow.cfg file next to the 'statsd_custom_client_path' key in the scheduler section of the config.\r\n\r\nAs such:\r\n`statsd_custom_client_path = company.statsdclient.customclient`\r\n\r\n2) Ensure the newly added client exists on the PYTHONPATH.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-6530](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6530)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n-
