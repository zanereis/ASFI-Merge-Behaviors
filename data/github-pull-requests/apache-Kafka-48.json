KRaft client uses an expiration service to complete FETCH requests that have timed out. This expiration service uses a different thread from the KRaft polling thread. This means that it is unsafe for the expiration service thread to call `tryCompleteFetchRequest`. `tryCompleteFetchRequest` reads and updates a lot of states that is assumed to be only be read and updated from the polling thread.\r\n\r\nThe KRaft client now does not call `tryCompleteFetchRequest` when the FETCH request has expired. It instead will send the FETCH response that was computed when the FETCH request was first handled.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a bug where the KRaft client was not sending the FETCH response immediately, if the response contained a diverging epoch or snapshot id.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

starting at [line 1085](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/streams/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/streams/integration/IQv2StoreIntegrationTest.java#L1085) in `IQv2StoreIntegrationTest.java`

upper.orElse(null));\r\n```\r\nbecause different combinations of `isPresent()` in the bounds is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

Implementation\r\nOn a high level this implementation introduces two new configurations `log.message.timestamp.before.max.ms` and `log.message.timestamp.after.max.ms` and  deprecates `log.message.timestamp.difference.max.ms`\r\n\r\nThe default value for all these three configs is maintained to be Long.MAX_VALUE for backward compatibility but with the newly added configurations we can have a finer control when validating message timestamps that are in the past and the future compared to the broker's timestamp.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\n- A message with past timestamp compared to the broker timestamp will be validated using `log.message.timestamp.before.max.ms`\r\n- A message with future timestamp compared to the broker timestamp will be validated using `log.message.timestamp.after.max.ms`\r\n- If these validations fail we return return Error code 32 (INVALID_TIMESTAMP) - Existing behavior no change in error message \r\n- We have deprecated `log.message.timestamp.difference.max.ms` and it is planned for removal in 4.0\r\n- To maintain backward compatibility if  the default value of `log.message.timestamp.before.max.ms` is not changed, we are assuming customer's are still using the deprecated config `log.message.timestamp.difference.max.ms` and validation is done using its value. This ensures that existing customers who have customized the value of `log.message.timestamp.difference.max.ms` will continue to see no change in behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\n- Unit test coverage\r\n- Functional Test cases\r\n    - Set no custom configuration and verify that default values are taking effect - verified through trace logs\r\n    - Set configs `log.message.timestamp.before.max.ms` and `log.message.timestamp.before.max.ms` in and validated that the Before and After validation works as expected and messages are rejected with the expected error message\r\n    - Dynamically overwritten `message.timestamp.after.max.ms` and `message.timestamp.before.max.ms` on a topic and verified that new configuration is taking effect.\r\n    - Set config `log.message.timestamp.difference.max.ms` and verified that it has precedence over `log.message.timestamp.before.max.ms` config - Backward compatibility test case\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-01T04:55:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T11:56:39Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T10:04:55Z","merged_at":"2023-08-24T10:04:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"25b128de81f826d0e0fe415acecf8b6d4cf837f4","assignee":{"login":"clolov","id":20223851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20223851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov","html_url":"https://github.com/clolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"clolov","id":20223851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjIzODUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20223851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov","html_url":"https://github.com/clolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

KRaft metadata transactions as specified in KIP-868.\r\n\r\nThis includes creating a new metadata version, IBP_3_6_IV1, which contains the three new records: AbortTransactionRecord, BeginTransactionRecord, EndTransactionRecord.\r\n\r\nMaintaining the various offsets and in-memory snapshots in QuorumController was getting too complex. Therefore, this PR splits that logic out into the LogReplayTracker class. This makes it possible to unit test events like Raft leader changes, which is difficult to do when the code is directly in

detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\nHello everyone, I am a Kafka user from China. Our company operates in public clouds overseas, such as AWS, Ali Cloud, and Huawei Cloud. We face a large amount of data exchange and business message delivery every day. Daily messages consume a significant amount of disk space. Purchasing the corresponding storage capacity on these cloud providers incurs substantial costs, especially for SSDs with ultra-high IOPS. High IOPS is very effective for disaster recovery, especially in the event of a sudden broker failure where storage space becomes full or memory space is exhausted leading to OOM kills. This high IOPS storage greatly improves data recovery efficiency, forcing us to adopt smaller storage specifications with high IO to save costs. Particularly, cloud providers only allow capacity expansion but not reduction.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have come up with a solution and would like to contribute it to the community for discussion. When we need to delete logs, I can purchase S3 or Minio storage from services like AWS and mount it to my brokers. When a log needs to be deleted, we can decide how it leaves the broker. The default is to delete it directly, while the move option moves it to S3. Since most of the deleted data is cold data that won't be used in the short term, this approach improves the retention period of historical data while maintaining good cost control.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse\r\nhttps://github.com/minio/minio\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask.\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

PR adds the following changes to the `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager`\r\n\r\n1. Added a guard in RemoteLogMetadataCache so that the incoming request can be served from the cache iff the corresponding user-topic-partition is initalized\r\n2. Improve error handling in ConsumerTask thread so that is not killed when there are errors in reading the internal topic\r\n3. ConsumerTask initialization should handle the case when there are no records to read\r\n\r\nand some other minor changes\r\n\r\nAdded Unit Tests for the changes\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Kamal Chandraprakash <kamal.chandraprakash@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

patch implements the OffsetFetch API in the new group coordinator.\r\n\r\nI found out that implementing the `RequireStable` flag is hard (to not say impossible) in the current model. For the context, the flag is here to ensure that an OffsetRequest request does not return stale offsets if there are pending offsets to be committed. In the scala code, we basically check the pending offsets data structure and if they are any pending offsets, we return the `UNSTABLE_OFFSET_COMMIT` error. This tells the consumer to retry.\r\n\r\nIn our new model, we don't have the pending offsets data structure. Instead, we use a timeline data structure to handle all the pending/uncommitted changes. Because of this we don't know whether offsets are pending for a particular group. Instead of doing this, I propose to not return the `UNSTABLE_OFFSET_COMMIT` error anymore. Instead, when `RequireStable` is set, we use a write operation to ensure that we read the latest offsets. If they are uncommitted offsets, the write operation ensures that the response is only return when they are committed. This gives a similar behaviour in the end.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not adds the MemberId and MemberEpoch fields to the request. This will be done in the next PR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13490.  I closed the original one due to rebase difficulties.\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\nImplemented wakeup() mechanism using a WakeupTrigger class to store the pending wakeup item, and when wakeup() is invoked, it checks whether there's an active task or a wakeup task.  \r\n- If there's an active task: the task will be completed exceptionally and the atomic reference will be freed up.\r\n- If there an wakedup task, which means wakeup() was invoked before a blocking call was issued.  Therefore, the current task will be completed exceptionally immediately.\r\n\r\nThis PR also addressed minor issues such as:\r\n1. Throwing WakeupException at the right place: As wakeups are thrown by completing an active future exceptionally.  The WakeupException is wrapped inside of the ExecutionException.\r\n2. mockConstruction is a thread-lock mock; therefore, we need to free up the reference before completing the test. Otherwise, other tests will continue using the thread-lock mock.","created_at":"2023-07-27T22:07:51Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T19:03:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-29T19:03:15Z","merged_at":"2023-08-29T19:03:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"945d21953e93409290a68dced0d366380866fb26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

patch does a few code cleanups in the group-coordinator module.\r\n- It renames `Coordinator` to `CoordinatorShard`;\r\n- It renames `ReplicatedGroupCoordinator` to `GroupCoordinatorShard`. I was never really happy with this name. The new name makes more sense to me;\r\n- It removes `TopicPartition` from the `GroupMetadataManager`. It was only used in log messages. The log context already includes it so we don't have to log it again.\r\n- It renames `assignors` to `consumerGroupAssignors`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

this PR, I have added a check in the _buildRemoteLogAuxState_ method of `ReplicaFetcherTierStateMachine` to check if the RLMM is initialized for the given `TopicPartition` before fetching `RemoteLogSegmentMetadata`. If it is uninitialized, we throw an error which will make the `ReplicaFetcher` to retry after some time.\r\n\r\nWithout this check, the `fetchRemoteLogSegmentMetadata` method in RLMM will block until the `RemoteLogMetadataCache` initalizes and this will prevent other ReplicaFetchers from running as well, also block handling of `LeaderAndIsrRequest` (They all share a common lock)\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13187\r\n- Original / abandoned PR for this issue is - https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11792.\r\n- ~~https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2601 is resolved in the current version of Mockito that we're using (`4.11.0`) so the workaround hack is no longer needed.~~ -> the issue still exists on newer JDKs, a different workaround hack is used (by modifying the testing-only constructor for `DistributedHerder`)\r\n- The current / new patch takes a slightly different approach from the original one. Using a combination of Mockito's [strict stubs](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.11.0/org/mockito/quality/Strictness.html#STRICT_STUBS) functionality and [verifyNoMoreInteractions](https://javadoc.io/static/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.11.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#verifyNoMoreInteractions(java.lang.Object...)), we get some nice properties - \r\n  - Any unused stubbings will lead to test failures\r\n  - Tests fail early when stubbed methods are invoked with different arguments\r\n  - Stubbed invocations are automatically verified and don't need explicit verification.\r\n-  The above properties allow us to make the test code significantly leaner and cleaner (as can be seen from the + / - SLOC in this diff).\r\n- One big caveat with this approach is that the number of invocations for stubbed methods isn't automatically verified for us since `Mockito` stubbings are applicable any number of times by default (unlike in `EasyMock` where the default is a single invocation being stubbed).\r\n- Hence, the older `EasyMock` way of stacking up expectations and then verifying them automatically took care of verifying the number of invocations for stubbed methods (assuming `anyTimes()` wasn't used in the expect calls).\r\n- While for a lot of cases this really isn't required (for instance, verifying the number of calls to `WorkerGroupMember::wakeup` in large tests that involve multiple calls to `DistributedHerder::tick`), there are some cases where it is crucial to the test's coverage and this patch attempts to retain that coverage wherever it seemed important by using the [times() verification mode](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/4.11.0/org/mockito/verification/VerificationMode.html) explicitly.\r\n- Only some minor refactoring was required for the `DistributedHerder` class itself - \r\n  - The visibility of the `herderExecutor` field was bumped up for this specific test - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ff390ab60a57100cc829be243ce525ac31523000/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerderTest.java#L3906\r\n  - The constructor used for testing was modified to use an array instead of varargs for the `uponShutdown` parameter in order to work around https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2601 here - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/938fee2b1fec52fa336f68118da120190bff4600/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L277\r\n\r\n###

face a problem with restarting of the tasks, sometimes it leads to resource leak. \r\n\r\nWe used the jdbc source connector and noticed an increasing of count of opened sessions on Vertica side. But this problem is applicable for all databases and possibly for all source connectors.\r\n\r\nOur case is the next: \r\n1) Run jdbc source connector (io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector) and set poll.interval.ms (86400000) > task.shutdown.graceful.timeout.ms (it's the property on Kafka-connect side, we set 10000)\r\n2) Send POST /connectors/<connector_name>/tasks/<task_number>/restart\r\nER: count of session is the same as before restart\r\nAR: count of session increases\r\n\r\nThe main problem is when org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.Worker#stopAndAwaitTasks(java.util.Collection<org.apache.kafka.connect.util.ConnectorTaskId>)  method is called it doesn't stop a source task itself. \r\nThe source task stops only if polling process stops on source task side. But if polling is continuing for a long time it leads to  resource occupation as a result it can lead to the fail on DB side. We suggest to stop source task explicitly \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

patch introduces the `SubscribedTopicDescriber` interface to the `group-coordinator` module and changes the necessary files to facilitate the assignors in being rack aware. Existing range assignor now has facilities to test for rack awareness in the future, whenever that is implemented.\r\nIn order to obtain and provide the rack information from the topic and cluster metadata to the assignors the following  modifications were made:-\r\n\r\n1. **SubcribedTopicDescribor** - Interface passed to the assignor to obtain topic and partition metadata.\r\n        - Assign function in PartitionAssignor interface now has two arguments, Assignment Spec and \r\n           SubscribedTopicDescriber.\r\n        - Removed the AssignmentTopicMetadata class and removed the topics attribute from the AssignmentSpec, all topic \r\n           metadata will now be provided by the SubscribedTopicDescriber.\r\n2. **SubcribedTopicMetadata** - Implementation of the interface above.\r\n3. Add partitionMetadata field to the ConsumerGroupPartitionMetadataValue.json, this will be empty if rack info doesn't exist.\r\n4. TopicMetadata has a new attribute Map<Integer, Set> partitionRackInfo - Map of partition Id to a set of its racks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew PR with all the previous commits squashed -\r\nLink to Old PR =

\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last stable version of plugin contains much dependency upgrades then bug fixing \r\nto read more about those changes please refer to the release notes :

PR aims to fix a bug, basically there is a mismatch between the Kafka users and the list tool output.\r\n\r\n\r\nKafka allows to create users with special characters that are encoded before storing them to ZK.\r\nLater they are decoded when they are requested by Kafka.\r\n\r\nIn our company we rely in the list users feature to check if the Kafka users exists, the problem is the users listed by kafa-configs.sh were not decoding the users and showing them with the string encoded.\r\n\r\nFor example if I want to create `myuser@myuser.com`\r\n\r\nCOMMAND\r\n```bash\r\n/etc/new_kafka/bin/kafka-configs.sh  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[iterations=4096,password=blabla],SCRAM-SHA-256=[password=blabla]' --entity-type users --entity-name myuser@myuser.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nOUTPUT\r\n```bash\r\nCompleted updating config for user myuser@myuser.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see the user is properly created but when we list it we see this:\r\n```bash\r\nkafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --entity-type users|grep myuser \r\n```\r\n\r\nOUTPUT\r\n```bash\r\nSCRAM credential configs for user-principal 'myuser%40myuser.com' are SCRAM-SHA-256=iterations=8192, SCRAM-SHA-512=iterations=4096 \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the problem is the describe is not decoding the users, in our case this is a problem as after creating the user we use this command to make sure the user exists fro future operations, for example password change.\r\n\r\nmore information in the [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15243)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST: After adding the patch users are properly listed:\r\n```bash\r\nkafka-configs.sh  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --alter --add-config 'SCRAM-SHA-256=[iterations=4096,password=blabla],SCRAM-SHA-256=[password=blabla]' --entity-type users --entity-name myuser@myuser.com\r\n\r\nCompleted updating config for user myuser@myuser.com.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW THE USER IS LISTED WITH THE REAL NAME\r\n```bash\r\nkafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --entity-type users|grep myuser@myuser.com\r\n\r\nSCRAM credential configs for user-principal 'myuser@myuser.com' are SCRAM-SHA-256=iterations=4096\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-25T17:20:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-18T01:50:24Z","closed_at":"2023-07-26T13:48:09Z","merged_at":"2023-07-26T13:48:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d81698ba4cb9c62185b0a50cc81ddea3047994d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4a1a4bd6ce6b6c9897b9733e4fdffda9218bbd1d","head":{"label":"sciclon2:KAFKA-15243","ref":"KAFKA-15243","sha":"4a1a4bd6ce6b6c9897b9733e4fdffda9218bbd1d","user":{"login":"sciclon2","id":74413315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDEzMzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74413315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2","html_url":"https://github.com/sciclon2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sciclon2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"8b027b6fefd46aade40abd125becc58dea02d6a3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

method is misleading, as it makes the caller assume that a given plugin class has only one supertype, when it may actually have multiple. Rather than documenting this limitation, or having this return an EnumSet (which duplicates the instanceof keyword), it is best to eliminate this function and rewrite all of the call-sites.\r\n\r\nThere were two main places that used this method:\r\n1. `AbstractHerder#connectorPluginConfig`. Here, it turns out to have been safe, because the config() method is the same for all of the plugins. Also the SinkConnector and SourceConnector superclasses are exclusive, so there is no problem with multiple interfaces in this method. The switch-case is replaced with an if-elseif-else ladder with instanceof checks.\r\n2. `PluginDesc#new` where the bug was noticed. Instead of calling PluginType.from on the instantiated class, we should instead use the PluginType based on which branch of execution we're on. If for example we're parsing `Converter`s to populate the `Set<PluginDesc<Converter>>` then we should use `PluginDesc.CONVERTER`. This turns out to duplicate the existing Class<T> klass argument to the `PluginScanner#getServiceLoaderPluginDesc` and `ReflectiveScanner#getPluginDesc` argument, so refactor these and change the log messages to use the type argument instead.\r\n\r\nExplaining why the rest of the diff exists and is so large:\r\n\r\nThere were also a lot of test call-sites for `PluginDesc#new`, some of which also depended on `ReflectiveScanner#versionFor(Class)` which i've been trying to eliminate. I took the opportunity to re-write all of those call-sites to provide explicit versions and types instead of inferring it from the classes. I also changed `ConnectorPluginsResourceTestConnector#version()` to emit the appVersion, rather than set up a new constant version string. I'll update the other UNDEFINED_VERSION cases with real versions in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nI found some test call-sites which were passing in invalid classes into the PluginDesc (and therefore, PluginType.from) triggering the `UNKNOWN` case. Since the `UNKNOWN` could only come from this function, I altered those call-sites to use SINK instead, and eliminated the now-unused `UNKNOWN` value.\r\n\r\nI also realized that we need to update the compareTo method, since with the new constructor implementation, the comparison may be inconsistent with the equals method. In particular, two PluginDesc with the same class, version, and loader but different types are already unequal, but should also have a nonzero comparison result. This required that locations are unique, so alter the location parsing logic to remove duplicates after making paths absolute.\r\n\r\nAlso, there were some tests which passed nulls into the PluginDesc constructor when they should be non-null in production. This broke when running the new compareTo implementation which relies on comparing the plugin locations. Add assertions to the PluginDesc constructor, and adjust the tests to compensate.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

For example, a connector to a relational database might\r\ncapture every change to a table.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these APIs, Kafka can be used for two broad classes of application:\r\n\r\n** Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data\r\nbetween systems or applications.\r\n\r\n** Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react\r\nto the streams of data.\r\n\r\n\r\nApache Kafka is in use at large and small companies worldwide, including\r\nCapital One, Goldman Sachs, ING, LinkedIn, Netflix, Pinterest, Rabobank,\r\nTarget, The New York Times, Uber, Yelp, and Zalando, among others.\r\n\r\nA big thank you for the following 107 contributors to this release!

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15238:\r\n\r\n> When Kafka Connect is run in distributed mode - if a sink connector's task is restarted (via a worker's REST API), the following sequence of steps will occur (on the DistributedHerder's thread):\r\n>\r\n> 1. The existing sink task will be stopped ([ref](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L1367))\r\n> 2. A new sink task will be started ([ref](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L1867C40-L1867C40))\r\n> 3. As a part of the above step, a new WorkerSinkTask will be instantiated ([ref](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/Worker.java#L656-L663))\r\n> 4. The DLQ reporter (see [KIP-298](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-298%3A+Error+Handling+in+Connect)) for the sink task is also instantiated and configured as a part of this ([ref](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/Worker.java#L1800))\r\n> 5. The DLQ reporter setup involves two synchronous admin client calls to list topics and create the DLQ topic if it isn't already created ([ref](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/errors/DeadLetterQueueReporter.java#L84-L87))\r\n>\r\n> All of these are occurring synchronously on the herder's tick thread - in this portion [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L457-L469) where external requests are run. If the admin client call in the DLQ reporter setup step blocks for some time (due to auth failures and retries or network issues or whatever other reason), this can cause the Connect worker to become non-functional (REST API requests will timeout) and even fall out of the Connect cluster and become a zombie (since the tick thread also drives group membership functions - see [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L403), [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/DistributedHerder.java#L535)).\r\n\r\n- This patch fixes the issue by moving the DLQ reporter setup from the `DistributedHerder`'s tick thread to the sink task's thread itself (in the [initializeAndStart](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4981fa939d588645401619bfc3e321dc523d10e7/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/WorkerTask.java#L202) phase). A `Supplier` is used to avoid passing a bunch of otherwise irrelevant parameters to the `WorkerSinkTask` (such as admin configs, producer configs etc.) and / or refactoring some of the `Worker` methods.\r\n- This way, any blocking in the admin client calls during DLQ setup will only affect the sink task for which the DLQ is being setup (by delaying its startup) instead of affecting the entire Connect worker.\r\n- In case the DLQ setup fails, the sink task's status will still be updated with the failure just like it would prior to this patch.\r\n- A small integration test is also added to verify the DLQ topic functionality. \r\n- Another thing to note is that no explicit timeout is being used for the blocking admin client calls which isn't ideal. We should probably add a reasonable timeout value (the default admin client timeout values are fairly large) for the overall `listTopics` + (potential) `createTopics` operation in either this patch or a separate one.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-24T07:24:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T13:11:32Z","closed_at":"2023-07-25T13:03:30Z","merged_at":"2023-07-25T13:03:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"08b3820d5e3994e137fa5ab917adc37a30910144","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/196860daae99ba373e2632a8cffb475b3bca74f0","head":{"label":"yashmayya:KAFKA-15238-dlq-setup-async","ref":"KAFKA-15238-dlq-setup-async","sha":"196860daae99ba373e2632a8cffb475b3bca74f0","user":{"login":"yashmayya","id":23502577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTAyNTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23502577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya","html_url":"https://github.com/yashmayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364165183,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQxNjUxODM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"yashmayya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yashmayya","id":23502577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTAyNTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23502577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya","html_url":"https://github.com/yashmayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashmayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yashmayya/kafka","description":"Mirror

a new client may result in a fatal failure if the bootstrap server cannot be resolved due to misconfiguration or transient network issues such as slow DNS. This is suboptimal because of the fact that it might take a long time for the address to become available at the DNS server, and users will need to continue to retry.  Also, the ConfigException exception type does not accurately reflect the root cause of the problem, which makes it hard to handle this failure case.  We think it is reasonable to allow users to have a grace period to retry if the address cannot be resolved immediately. Also, poisoning the clients during the construction can be obstructive; I think it is better to fail the client on its first attempt to connect to the network.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nChanging the `NetworkClient` constructor to accept a set of bootstrap configurations, which is then used for bootstrapping during the `NetworkClient.poll()` operation.  To avoid passing more parameters to the existing list, I wrapped the configurations into a `BootstrapConfiguration` class.\r\n\r\nOn the client side, bootstrapping are removed as the motivation of the KIP is to avoid bootstrapping during the instance construction.","created_at":"2023-07-19T23:25:20Z","updated_at":"2024-12-27T03:39:08Z","closed_at":"2024-12-27T03:39:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

Summary\r\nThis pull request aims to address sub-points 1 and 2 from

discussions in https://lists.apache.org/thread/kxd6fffq02thbpd0p5y4mfbs062g7jr6 I have implemented the remote log size calculations by sequentially iterating through the metadata which is available in cache. If/when the need arises for a more performant implementation this can be revisited.\r\n\r\nAdd a new method - `remoteLogSize` - to the interface `RemoteLogMetadataManager`.\r\n\r\nImplement `remoteLogSize` in `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManager`.\r\n\r\nExtend `TopicBasedRemoteLogMetadataManagerTest` to cover two scenarios (size calculation of no remote log; size calculation of a remote log).","created_at":"2023-07-19T13:20:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T05:40:38Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T05:40:38Z","merged_at":"2023-07-28T05:40:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"722b259961c39da83db254eea54c7b87249ab1ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

patch does a few things:\r\n1) It introduces version 9 of the OffsetCommit API. This new version has no schema changes but it can return a StaleMemberEpochException if the new consumer group protocol is used. Note the use of `\"latestVersionUnstable\": true` in the request schema. This means that this new version is not available yet unless activated.\r\n2) It renames the `generationId` field in the request to `GenerationIdOrMemberEpoch`. This is backward compatible change.\r\n3) It introduces the new StaleMemberEpochException error.\r\n4) It does a minor refactoring in OffsetCommitRequest class.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
