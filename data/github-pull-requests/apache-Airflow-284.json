sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2238\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    Prepare for the migration to commit directly to github - the PR tool only needs to know about github now. Tested in squash mode https://github.com/ashb/incubator-airflow/commit/437f95112060c6f23f8f8520a9e2341390407e11 here and non-squash https://github.com/ashb/incubator-airflow/commit/437f95112060c6f23f8f8520a9e2341390407e11\r\n\r\n    I also removed dead code and fixed the file to not have any PEP8 warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n    No unit tests, but did test as well as possible against my own fork.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2415\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you have an operator with a template fields argument, that is a dictionary, e.g.:\r\n`template_fields = ([dict_args])`\r\n\r\nAnd you populate that dictionary with a field that an integer in a DAG, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n...\r\ndict_args = {'ds': '{{ ds }}', num_times: 5}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen ariflow will give you the following error:\r\n`{base_task_runner.py:95} INFO - Subtask: airflow.exceptions.AirflowException: Type '<type 'int'>' used for parameter 'dict_args[num_times]' is not supported for templating`\r\n\r\nThis fix aims to resolves that issue by immediately resolving numbers without attempting to template them\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`tests/models.py:DagTest.test_render_template_field_macro`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2517\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn backfill, we can provide key-value pairs through CLI and those pairs can be accessed through macros. This is just like the way `trigger_dag -c` works [1].\r\n\r\nLet's walk through an example.\r\n\r\nIn the airflow CLI we specify a key-value pair.\r\n```\r\nairflow backfill hello_world -s 2018-02-01 -e 2018-02-08 -c '{\"text\": \"some text\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the DAG file, I have a `BashOperator` that contains a template command and I want \r\n{{ dag_run.conf.text }} resolves to the text I passed in CLI. \r\n```python\r\ntemplated_command = \"\"\"\r\n    echo \"ds = {{ ds }}\"\r\n    echo \"prev_ds = {{ macros.datetime.strftime(prev_execution_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\") }}\"\r\n    echo \"next_ds = {{ macros.datetime.strftime(next_execution_date, \"%Y-%m-%d\") }}\"\r\n    echo \"text_through_conf = {{ dag_run.conf.text }}\"\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nbash_operator = BashOperator(\r\n    task_id='bash_task',\r\n    bash_command=templated_command,\r\n    dag=dag\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nRendered Bash command in Airflow UI.\r\n<img width=\"1246\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-22 at 4 33 59 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6065051/40395666-04c41574-5dde-11e8-9ec2-c0312b7203e6.png\">\r\n\r\n[1] https://airflow.apache.org/cli.html#trigger_dag\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2463) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly to enable hive (e.g. through hive audit hook) to log task instance context( dag_id, task_id, dag_run_id and task instance execution_date) for hive queries. This would give users more audit and research power. For example:\r\n\r\n- When data in one table was polluted, people can find out what tasks using the table need to rerun.\r\n- Grouping hive queries by dag_id and task_id.\r\n- Figure out whether the DAG run of the task instance is a manual run, scheduled run or backfill run.\r\n\r\nThis change will make task instance context available in the following cases:\r\n\r\n- HiveServer2Hook() calls in Airflow official operators: as hive_conf\r\n- HiveCliHook() and HiveServer2Hook() calls in PythonOperator: as hive_conf\r\n- hive cli calls in BashOperator: as environment variable\r\n\r\nThe following cases are already covered without this change (with updated names):\r\n- HiveCliHook() calls in HiveOperator(): as hive_conf\r\n\r\nThe following cases are not cover even with this change:\r\n- beeline calls in BashOperator.\r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\nIf as environment variable, context would be available as `AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_ID`, `AIRFLOW_CTX_TASK_ID`, `AIRFLOW_CTX_EXECUTION_DATE`, `AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_RUN_ID`.\r\nIf as hvie_conf, as `airflow.ctx.dag_id`, `airflow.ctx.task_id`,  `airflow.ctx.execution_date`, `airflow.ctx.dag_run_id`. This is to follow the environment variable and hive conf naming convention.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n-- tests/operators/bash_operator.py\r\n-- tests/operators/python_operator.py:PythonOperatorTest.test_echo_env_variables\r\n-- tests/hooks/test_hive_hook.py: TestHiveCliHook.test_run_cli_with_hive_conf\r\n-- tests/hooks/test_hive_hook.py: TestHiveServer2Hook. test_get_results_with_hive_conf\r\n\r\nHiveServer2Hook uses impyla, which is compatible with at most thrift==0.9.3, but we are using thrift==0.11.0 in our CI. However we cannot just downgrade thrift because our new client package used in HiveCliHook, hmsclient, cannot work with thrift<=0.9.3. Thus the unit tests for HiveSever2Hook are removed and tested manually instead.\r\n\r\nThis logic has been running in Airbnb production for a week.\r\n\r\n- Manually tested with test DAG file: https://gist.github.com/yrqls21/a89e37b82b5fc58a2e189d8ee23e61e4\r\n\r\n`airflow test` output:\r\nhive_cli task:\r\n```\r\n[2018-05-17 02:22:19,103] {hive_hooks.py:243} INFO -

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2429\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  I remove BaseExecutor import from airflow.executors.__init__ as flake8 complain. It turns out that it is refered in tests.__init__. This causes travis to fails. Add back the import line.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nDocs-only change.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\nThis PR partially addresses [AIRFLOW-83](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-83).\r\n\r\nA related PR (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2962) exists with the MongoHook as well as an operator, but the status appears unclear given its complexity.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIntroduces the `airflow.contrib.hooks.mongo_hook.MongoHook`, which is a thin wrapper on top of [PyMongo's MongoClient](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/index.html).\r\n\r\nBy default, the `get_conn()` of this hook will check that the database connection is live, and the hook also proxies the MongoClient's `get_database()`. The liveness check can be disabled by passing the appropriate parameter to `get_conn(check_connection=False)`. By default the MongoClient is shared by all users of the hook, as PyMongo has its own connection pooling mechanism.\r\n\r\nWhen initialising MongoClient, the hook will use the connection settings to construct a [Mongo connection URI](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/). Connection strings logged by the hook mask the password.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: `tests.contrib.hooks.test_mongo_hook.TestMongoHook`, which tests URI construction as well as liveness check in `get_conn()`. Successful MongoClient connectivity isn't tested: given a valid URI construction, this is assumed to be PyMongo's responsibility.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2499\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, running unit tests is a difficult process. Airflow tests depend on many external services and other custom setup, which makes it hard for contributors to work on this codebase. CI builds have also been unreliable[0][1][2][3], and it is hard to reproduce the causes. Having contributors trying to emulate the build environment every time makes it easier to get to an \"it works on my machine\" sort of situation.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a dockerised version of the current build pipeline. This setup has a few advantages:\r\n\r\n* TravisCI tests are reproducible locally\r\n* The same build setup can be used to create a local development environment (there's a request for it [4])\r\n\r\n### Implementation details\r\n\r\n* I'm using Docker Compose for the container orchestration and configuration.\r\n* MySQL, PostgreSQL, OpenLDAP, krb5 and rabbitmq are now services running inside their own containers\r\n* I created a separate repo, called incubator-airflow-ci[5] (TravisCI build here[6]), where a base image with all dependencies is built. In this case, I'm following the same pattern the CouchDB[7] project follows\r\n* Hadoop, Hive and MiniCluster were moved to this base image\r\n* The current TravisCI pipeline lives here[8]\r\n\r\n### How to run locally\r\n\r\n* `docker-compose -f scripts/ci/docker-compose.yml run airflow-testing bash`\r\n* Then, inside the container,: `tox -e py35-backend_sqlite` or any other valid `TOX_ENV` value\r\n\r\n### Some observations\r\n\r\nThe whole environment setup on TravisCI (the setup before the tests are run) takes around 4 minutes. It is similar to the current version, but maybe some things can be optimised in the future by reducing the docker image size. Right now, the docker image size is hard to reduce, given we pre-install Hadoop, Hive and MiniCluster. You can check what contributes to the image size here[9]\r\n\r\nI also had to change a few tests and default connections that were pointing to localhost. Now docker-compose takes care of creating an actual DNS name for the service containers, so the tests now refer to them by that name. The DNS names are the same as the container name in the docker-compose.yml file.\r\n\r\n[0] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-671\r\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-968\r\n[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2157\r\n[3] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2272\r\n[4] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1042 \r\n[5] https://github.com/gerardo/incubator-airflow-ci\r\n[6] https://travis-ci.org/gerardo/incubator-airflow-ci\r\n[7] https://travis-ci.org/apache/couchdb-ci\r\n[8] https://travis-ci.org/gerardo/incubator-airflow\r\n[9] https://microbadger.com/images/gerardo/airflow-testing\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt modifies unit tests. There are no new ones but the modified ones need revision.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2498\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- The SFTP sensor is using SFTP hook and passing `sftp_conn_id` to `sftp_conn_id` parameter which doesn't exist. The solution would be to remove the parameter name, hence defaulting to first parameter which in this case would be `ftp_conn_id`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-21T08:55:12Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T23:18:00Z","closed_at":"2018-05-23T12:10:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2126cd0ed2631de4b6204ae970ce1f90441134ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/af9fb7e082b9686f20c560bdeec8914f92dac63d","head":{"label":"kaxil:AIRFLOW-2498","ref":"AIRFLOW-2498","sha":"af9fb7e082b9686f20c560bdeec8914f92dac63d","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2472\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nImplement MySqlHook.bulk_dump since the opposite\r\noperation bulk_load is already implemented.\r\nThis PR also addresses some flake8 warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded the following tests to tests.operators.operators.MySqlTest\r\n\r\n- test_mysql_hook_test_bulk_dump\r\n- test_mysql_hook_test_bulk_dump_mock\r\n\r\nThe former dumps a table into a real file, but it needs a certain MySQL setting and database user privilege. Travis doesn't provide them, so the latter is also added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2485\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Replace incorrect `this.log` keyword for logging of Qubole Sensor to `self.log`\r\nI am sure https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3297#issuecomment-385988083 was supposed to mean `self.log.info` instead of `this.log.info`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2483\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n- Replacing the `==None` with `is None`\r\n- PEP 8 explicitly states that \"comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not, never the equality operators.\"\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

This is relevant to branching operators, for example, as they rely on skipping downstream tasks: where such tasks have a SLA, they are prone to emitting false positive SLA miss e-mails.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nWe have tested this internally as a branch of v1.9.0, but not as part of master. No unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2477\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe original fix could be found at https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1914 which add unit for duration and landing_time for old UI. The unit doesn't show up in new UI. After the fix, the unit shows up correctly in the UI.\r\n<img width=\"1178\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-17 at 12 01 00 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3223098/40161518-df456c52-5965-11e8-81cf-5fa5583fa5c7.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1207\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-17 at 12 01 40 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3223098/40161528-eb61d7dc-5965-11e8-8d78-b3bab4b2a2f3.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1255\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-17 at 12 01 07 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3223098/40161534-eefe74ae-5965-11e8-9de8-be2e29ad7dd5.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-17 at 12 01 47 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3223098/40161541-f289d6ae-5965-11e8-995d-1ab4cf9ca67b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2475\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nA \"Go to triggered DAG\" button is added in the graph and tree view when opening a task instance and the TriggerDagRunOperator is used.\r\nI've added a `ui_fields` attribute to the BaseOperator for attributes to pass through to the UI. This way we can pass the target DAG id to the UI.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/40143208-205ded6e-595b-11e8-88eb-b76845731f49.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo test added, verified by opening UI, checking if button only displays when using the TriggerDagRunOperator, and clicking on button to verify correct URL.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-16T21:56:54Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T16:06:33Z","closed_at":"2019-01-25T16:06:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3443469bb754927c3beaf7c406da5a197986ff66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2466\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n    There is a bug in _change_state_for_tis_without_dagrun where the update is not filtered by task_id, this means that if any tasks in a dagrun match, all will be updated. The existing tests do not cover the case of multiple task instances in a single dag/dagrun.\r\n\r\n    I have updated the code to properly filter by task_id and I have updated the tests to consider the possibility of multiple task instances on a single dag/dagrun.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n    - fix to catch the missed case in tests/jobs.py:SchedulerJobTest.test_change_state_for_tis_without_dagrun\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-14T23:34:55Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T08:59:50Z","closed_at":"2018-05-30T08:59:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb3dc9645d67afab0bcd0a936a94319ccb413101","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3360/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3360/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3360/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/58f2b0ff93c75e633985306b90069ca09ddb6da5","head":{"label":"CloverHealth:AF2466","ref":"AF2466","sha":"58f2b0ff93c75e633985306b90069ca09ddb6da5","user":{"login":"CloverHealth","id":8988137,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg5ODgxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8988137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth","html_url":"https://github.com/CloverHealth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44642707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDY0MjcwNw==","name":"airflow","full_name":"CloverHealth/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CloverHealth","id":8988137,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg5ODgxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8988137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth","html_url":"https://github.com/CloverHealth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CloverHealth/airflow","description":"Airflow

Description\r\n- [x] When using `destination_object` while having a wildcard in `source_object`, the value of the former is prepended to the actual path the file is copied to. The original code is adding a `/` character after the prefix, assuming that the goal is to specify a \"folder\" which is not necessarily the case; that behaviour also results in `//` when prefix already includes a slash, which in GCS is not normalised to a single slash as is the case in POSIX. This PR removes this extra character and adds some optimisation to the code, as well as additional documentation and tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The included tests cover several scenarios when using wildcard in combination with `description_object`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] Example explaining the behaviour added to the docstring.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe were running into an issue with old images being run in our Airflow Kubernetes cluster. This is because by default, the imagePullPolicy is set to 'IfNotPresent'. Developers should be able to control this.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds a single parameter\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2452\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHiveCliHook.load_file has a parameter called\r\nfield_dict, which defines name-type pairs\r\nfor columns, must be OrderedDict so as to\r\nkeep columns' order, but it's undocumented.\r\nThis PR adds an note about that, and fixes\r\nHiveCliHook.load_df function which calls\r\nload_file internally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded new assertion to TestHiveCliHook.test_load_df.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses a bug discussed in recent comments comments on the following JIRA:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2016\r\n\r\nIn those comments I confirmed with the original submitter for that ticket, @DanSedov , that the existing code has a problem and that it is correctly addressed by this commit.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] This change moves the `template_fields` for the DataProc WorkflowTemplate operators out of the base operator and into the derived classes.  This is necessary because the derived classes only use subsets of the templated fields, and so when task instances are instantiated for them, errors are thrown for the fields that are missing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR is a small bug fix that will be difficult to test in unit tests, but I have tested it on our Airflow deployments and confirmed that it fixes the problem.  Prior to this commit, the WorkflowTemplate operators are not usable because of this bug.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [X] No new functionality is provided\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2449\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMySqlTest and PostgresTest in tests/operators/operators.py\r\nhave some unexecuted tests due to wrong naming convention.\r\nThis PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test since it's a fix for test itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2376\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFix the issue which airflow cli throws \"backports.configparser.NoSectionError: No section: u'hive'\" error.\r\nThe reason is because when user uses either run or backfill cli command, airflow tries to copy some of the confirguration(https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/utils/configuration.py#L34). Currently hive is one of section for copy, but if user's airflow.cfg doesn't have configuration for this section. It will throw the error described in the jira ticket. Since hive section is not required for core, just remove that.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-10T06:56:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T19:06:56Z","closed_at":"2018-05-14T08:36:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9b507f6f970ce0202b04ca765ab02fd71b314a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7d407c54ccd98638c094af41a5f48c60a855d847","head":{"label":"feng-tao:airflow-2376","ref":"airflow-2376","sha":"7d407c54ccd98638c094af41a5f48c60a855d847","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122814628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI4MTQ2Mjg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feng-tao/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2444\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe implementation for include_adhoc option in backfill is removed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1667/files. We should remove that option from cli as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-09T20:20:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T08:14:32Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T08:14:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"018f077a55efa0c5bcfe770af072d1ff3947307f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/80e1b57c2b18f014f2513597a52e176298c01423","head":{"label":"feng-tao:remove-unused-flag","ref":"remove-unused-flag","sha":"80e1b57c2b18f014f2513597a52e176298c01423","user":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":122814628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjI4MTQ2Mjg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"feng-tao/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao/airflow","description":"Apache

JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Jira [AIRFLOW-2442](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2442) and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe \"airflow run\" command creates a connection to the database and leaves it open (until killed by SQLALchemy later). The number of these connections can skyrocket whenever hundreds/thousands of tasks are launched simultaneously, and potentially hit the database connection limit.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in cli.py, the run() method first calls \r\n{code}settings.configure_orm(disable_connection_pool=True){code} correctly\r\nto use a NullPool, but then parses any custom configs and again calls {code}settings.configure_orm(){code}, thereby overriding the desired behavior with a QueuePool.\r\nThe QueuePool uses the default configs for SQL_ALCHEMY_POOL_SIZE (5 connections) and SQL_ALCHEMY_POOL_RECYCLE (1 hour). This means that while the task is running and the executor is sending heartbeats, the sleeping connection is idle until it is killed by SQLAlchemy.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Unit Tests. I ran unit tests on the head of master and there were 6 failures.\r\nI then ran unit tests with my patch and encountered the same errors that are unrelated to my change.\r\n\r\n```\r\n960 tests run in 813.349 seconds.\r\n6 FAILED, 129 errors, 24 skipped (801 tests passed)\r\n\r\n[fail] 0.03% tests.contrib.hooks.test_ssh_hook.SSHHookTest.test_tunnel: 0.2227s [fail] 0.02% tests.transplant_class.<locals>.C.test_cli_webserver_background: 0.1979s\r\n[fail] 0.02% tests.contrib.hooks.test_ssh_hook.SSHHookTest.test_ssh_connection: 0.1712s\r\n[fail] 0.01% tests.transplant_class.<locals>.C.test_cli_webserver_foreground: 0.1157s [fail] 0.00% tests.transplant_class.<locals>.C.test_overwrite_schema: 0.0329s\r\n[fail] 0.00% tests.utils.test_json.TestAirflowJsonEncoder.test_encode_raises: 0.0010s \r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] System Tests: I have a staging environment with an internal branch of Airflow that I used to verify the change in behavior. I ran a Stress Test DAG that launches about 10k tasks for several days and verified the behavior with and without my fix.\r\nNotice that with my fix, the number of open DB connections sharply decreases from 20k to < 250.\r\n![fixed_before_and_after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/225711/39836123-37b9bc38-5387-11e8-88c4-ef3b1fec672c.jpg)\r\n\r\nSample DAG Run log show success:\r\n```\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,698] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,698] {settings.py:147} DEBUG - settings.configure_orm(): Traceback:\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,699] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: ['  File \"/usr/local/bin/airflow\", line 28, in <module>\\n    args.func(args)\\n', '  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/bin/cli.py\", line 351, in run\\n    settings.configure_orm(disable_connection_pool=True)\\n', '  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/settings.py\", line 147, in configure_orm\\n    logging.debug(\"settings.configure_orm(): Traceback:\\\\n{}\".format(repr(traceback.format_stack())))\\n']\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,699] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,698] {settings.py:151} INFO - settings.configure_orm(): Using NullPool\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,700] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,700] {models.py:192} INFO - Filling up the DagBag from /srv/data/airflow-bronze/stress_test/100/dag.py\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,700] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,700] {models.py:423} INFO - Processing dag_folder as file\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,701] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,700] {models.py:251} INFO - Processing filepath /srv/data/airflow-bronze/stress_test/100/dag.py\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,701] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,701] {models.py:271} INFO - Processed file is not a zip file\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,701] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: [2018-05-08 18:59:27,701] {models.py:279} DEBUG - Importing /srv/data/airflow-bronze/stress_test/100/dag.py\r\n[2018-05-08 18:59:27,702] {base_task_runner.py:93} INFO - Subtask: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/utils/helpers.py:351: DeprecationWarning: Importing BashOperator directly from <module 'airflow.operators' from '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/operators/__init__.pyc'> has been deprecated.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2436\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFor initdb operation, database is not there yet, but cli_logger is trying to write audit log into database and currently logs error message (only error message but not fail).\r\nAs initdb is a one time bootstrap operation for Airflow, I think it's fine to remove cli_logger on initdb.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ncli_logger already has a test. Change is to remove from initdb operation and tested with sqllite.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`","created_at":"2018-05-08T14:25:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T08:16:18Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T08:16:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"298688ba67ea307185c01cdfeb77ce3be7f86e64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/03b5419193d5b78189c9b233f5a17d7ea1eb3c7d","head":{"label":"jinhyukchang:master","ref":"master","sha":"03b5419193d5b78189c9b233f5a17d7ea1eb3c7d","user":{"login":"jinhyukchang","id":14986757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTg2NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14986757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhyukchang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126496351,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY0OTYzNTE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"jinhyukchang/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinhyukchang","id":14986757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTg2NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14986757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhyukchang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhyukchang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinhyukchang/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2435\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdded launch_type to ECSOperator. Default value remains EC2\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIf someone can point me in the right direction for this, gladly.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T08:05:43Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T18:51:20Z","closed_at":"2018-05-14T18:51:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f5e0e498c1216f4e42e6031469c20ebcf5e5b25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/2ce57fb63323c3d837fd33aeacb8d8e830380194","head":{"label":"ThomasVdBerge:ecs-fargate","ref":"ecs-fargate","sha":"2ce57fb63323c3d837fd33aeacb8d8e830380194","user":{"login":"ThomasVdBerge","id":1204075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1204075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasVdBerge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132574645,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI1NzQ2NDU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"ThomasVdBerge/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ThomasVdBerge","id":1204075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1204075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasVdBerge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasVdBerge/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasVdBerge/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2434\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen processing DAG files, create multiple dagrun, when dagrun is less than max_active_runs。\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThe online test has been done and no problems have been found\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T07:18:31Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T22:38:53Z","closed_at":"2018-06-01T22:38:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cd31633b085d3ba8ee443f01aa162d4c2ed0841","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/70b4074859f67429b0fcf675570f215d85491d46","head":{"label":"mapengbo:feature/colse_session","ref":"feature/colse_session","sha":"70b4074859f67429b0fcf675570f215d85491d46","user":{"login":"mapengbo","id":14049080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQ5MDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14049080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo","html_url":"https://github.com/mapengbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132546723,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI1NDY3MjM=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mapengbo/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mapengbo","id":14049080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQ5MDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14049080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo","html_url":"https://github.com/mapengbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mapengbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mapengbo/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2412\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHiveCliHook.load_file doesn't actually execute\r\nLOAD DATA statement via beeline bundled with\r\nHive under 2.0 due to HIVE-10541.\r\nThis PR provides a workaround for this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following tests. In addition, I confirmed the problem described above is resolved using a real Hadoop cluster with Hive 1.2.1.\r\n\r\n- TestHiveCliHook.test_run_cli\r\n- TestHiveCliHook.test_load_file\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-08T01:09:42Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T10:26:07Z","closed_at":"2018-05-08T09:52:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"603195688e6806c9c4253900daa39480ea62cc1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7ec74bdc3ed6a08fb112badf277bdef28a6bc460","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-2412","ref":"AIRFLOW-2412","sha":"7ec74bdc3ed6a08fb112badf277bdef28a6bc460","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers, please accept my PR (as soon as CI finishes successfully).\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2427) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-2427\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2427\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI've added tests to `NamedHivePartitionSensor`. I've also added the ability to pass an hook when creating the sensor and to avoid passing the database name when passing the partition name.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  + `test_parse_partition_name_correct`\r\n  + `test_parse_partition_name_incorrect`\r\n  + `test_parse_partition_name_default`\r\n  + `test_poke_existing`\r\n  + `test_poke_non_existing`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2424\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn line with @Fokko's k8s testing. I think it adds value to have a \"dagrun_status\" endpoint so we can determine if a dag run with the k8s executor finishes completely. I have also added a test for whether a dag will finish correctly even if the airflow pod is deleted.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI added `test_dagrun_status` for the new endpoint and `test_integration_run_dag_with_scheduler_failure` for the k8s executor\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2402) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2402\r\n    - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFixing task log reading in RBAC UI, which is because [this PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3214) made change to `www/views.py` but not `www_rbac/views.py`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/www_rbac/test_views.py:TestLogViews.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-05T00:10:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T07:42:19Z","closed_at":"2018-05-29T19:47:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40da313476c910d884ed4a60ed960ceedd4ee68a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6cf93c3dd3ad30026f089bb42ef1e21d14799213","head":{"label":"KevinYang21:kevin_yang_fix_rbac_view","ref":"kevin_yang_fix_rbac_view","sha":"6cf93c3dd3ad30026f089bb42ef1e21d14799213","user":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":106481430,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDY0ODE0MzA=","name":"airflow","full_name":"KevinYang21/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KevinYang21","id":7818710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTg3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7818710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21","html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KevinYang21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KevinYang21/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2423\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR enables syncing DAGs from a common remote location in S3 without scheduler or web-server restart.  Syncing DAGs is useful while running Airflow on a distributed setup (like in mesos), where the hosts/containers running the scheduler and the web-server can change with time. Also, where scheduler and web-server restart is to be avoided for every DAG update/addition. This PR syncs DAGs periodically from S3 location with the local DAGs in scheduler and web-server. The newly added/updated DAG in S3 is reflected in the web-server and scheduler local directories, and added to the meta-store backend on every call of `collect_dags` \r\nIf `s3_dags_folder` property is defined in the airflow config, the '.py' files from S3 location are recursively scanned. The corresponding DAG file from S3 is downloaded only if its new or its last update timestamp is later than the local DAG file's last update timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested it locally, and using it with airflow deployment on mesos. Currently, there is no test for s3_hook which is required in this PR, due to which a test for S3 DAG sync is not added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-04T23:55:29Z","updated_at":"2019-01-28T05:59:44Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T21:13:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8847f453c07b1629c6252328910b26b7da39fa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0820f396167b06f7a82ca246c877bd89abac0ad0","head":{"label":"aditiverma:add-DAGs-without-restart","ref":"add-DAGs-without-restart","sha":"0820f396167b06f7a82ca246c877bd89abac0ad0","user":{"login":"aditiverma","id":3223214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma","html_url":"https://github.com/aditiverma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132199339,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzIxOTkzMzk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"aditiverma/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aditiverma","id":3223214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma","html_url":"https://github.com/aditiverma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditiverma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aditiverma/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2423\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR enables syncing DAGs from a common remote location in S3 without scheduler or web-server restart.  Syncing DAGs is useful while running Airflow on a distributed setup (like in mesos), where the hosts/containers running the scheduler and the web-server can change with time. Also, where scheduler and web-server restart is to be avoided for every DAG update/addition. This PR syncs DAGs periodically from S3 location with the local DAGs in scheduler and web-server. The newly added/updated DAG in S3 is reflected in the web-server and scheduler local directories, and added to the meta-store backend on every call of `collect_dags` \r\nIf `s3_dags_folder` property is defined in the airflow config, the '.py' files from S3 location are recursively scanned. The corresponding DAG file from S3 is downloaded only if its new or its last update timestamp is later than the local DAG file's last update timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested it locally, and using it with airflow deployment on mesos. Currently, there is no test for s3_hook which is required in this PR, due to which a test for S3 DAG sync is not added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n    - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-04T23:32:21Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T23:55:42Z","closed_at":"2018-05-04T23:55:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9613e3fc9b293bfa7bbffd7bea0fc0b8ea17d5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3317/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3317/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3317/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0820f396167b06f7a82ca246c877bd89abac0ad0","head":{"label":"BranchMetrics:add-DAGs-without-restart","ref":"add-DAGs-without-restart","sha":"0820f396167b06f7a82ca246c877bd89abac0ad0","user":{"login":"BranchMetrics","id":7772941,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc3NzI5NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7772941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics","html_url":"https://github.com/BranchMetrics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BranchMetrics/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"16bae5634df24132b37eb752fe816f51bf7e83ca","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache Airflow -
