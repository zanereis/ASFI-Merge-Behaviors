to [KAFKA-15818](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15818)\r\n\r\nThis is a bug in the AsyncKafkaConsumer poll loop that it does not send an event to the network thread to acknowledge user poll. This causes a few issues:\r\n1. Autocommit won't work without user setting the timer\r\n2. the member will just leave the group after rebalance timeout and never able to rejoin.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, a few subtle changes are made to address this issue\r\n1. Hook up poll event to the AsyncKafkaConsumer#poll. It is only fired once per invocation\r\n2. Upon entering staled state, we need to reset HeartbeatState otherwise we will get an invalid request\r\n3. We will clear and current assignment and remove all assigned partitions once the heartbeat is sent.  See changes in `onHeartbeatRequestSent` \r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n1. We will need to implement the callback invocation logic.  We didn't do it for this PR is because we want to limit to scope of the changes\r\n2. I think FencedException and UnknownMemberIDException: we will also need to reset the HeartbeatState.

Summary\r\nBasically when executing `kafka-leader-election.sh` the custom timeouts passed by the config file (--admin.config option) is not honoured. SO after [this investigation](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16015) I came across  with the issue.\r\n\r\nUsing the kafka-leader-election.sh I was getting random timeouts like these:\r\n```bash\r\necho \"HellError completing leader election (PREFERRED) for partition: sebatestemptytopic-4: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: The request timed out.\r\nError completing leader election (PREFERRED) for partition: __CruiseControlMetrics-3: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: The request timed out.\r\nError completing leader election (PREFERRED) for partition: __KafkaCruiseControlModelTrainingSamples-18: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: The request timed out.\r\nError completing leader election (PREFERRED) for partition: __KafkaCruiseControlPartitionMetricSamples-8: org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException: The request timed out.  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThese timeouts were raised from the client side as the controller always finished with all the Kafka leader elections.\r\nOne pattern I detected was always the timeouts were raised after about 15 seconds.\r\nSo i checked this command has an option to pass configurations\r\n```bash\r\nOption                                  Description\r\n------                                  -----------\r\n--admin.config <String: config file>    Configuration properties files to pass\r\n                                          to the admin client \r\n```\r\n\r\nI created the file in order to increment the values of request.timeout.ms  and default.api.timeout.ms. So even after increasing these values  I got the same result, timeouts were happening, like the new values were not having any effect. \r\n\r\nSo I checked the source code and I came across with a bug, no matter the value we pass to the timeouts the default values were ALWAYS overwriting them.\r\nThis is the code in the[ trunk branch](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/tools/LeaderElectionCommand.java#L102)\r\n```bash\r\n static void run(Duration timeoutMs, String... args) throws Exception {\r\n        LeaderElectionCommandOptions commandOptions = new LeaderElectionCommandOptions(args);\r\n\r\n        commandOptions.maybePrintHelpOrVersion();\r\n\r\n        commandOptions.validate();\r\n        ElectionType electionType = commandOptions.getElectionType();\r\n        Optional<Set<TopicPartition>> jsonFileTopicPartitions =\r\n            Optional.ofNullable(commandOptions.getPathToJsonFile())\r\n                .map(path -> parseReplicaElectionData(path));\r\n\r\n        Optional<String> topicOption = Optional.ofNullable(commandOptions.getTopic());\r\n        Optional<Integer> partitionOption = Optional.ofNullable(commandOptions.getPartition());\r\n        final Optional<Set<TopicPartition>> singleTopicPartition =\r\n            (topicOption.isPresent() && partitionOption.isPresent()) ?\r\n                Optional.of(Collections.singleton(new TopicPartition(topicOption.get(), partitionOption.get()))) :\r\n                Optional.empty();\r\n\r\n        /* Note: No need to look at --all-topic-partitions as we want this to be null if it is use.\r\n         * The validate function should be checking that this option is required if the --topic and --path-to-json-file\r\n         * are not specified.\r\n         */\r\n        Optional<Set<TopicPartition>> topicPartitions = jsonFileTopicPartitions.map(Optional::of).orElse(singleTopicPartition);\r\n\r\n        Properties props = new Properties();\r\n        if (commandOptions.hasAdminClientConfig()) {\r\n            props.putAll(Utils.loadProps(commandOptions.getAdminClientConfig()));\r\n        }\r\n        props.setProperty(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, commandOptions.getBootstrapServer());\r\n        props.setProperty(AdminClientConfig.DEFAULT_API_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG, Long.toString(timeoutMs.toMillis()));\r\n        props.setProperty(AdminClientConfig.REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG, Long.toString(timeoutMs.toMillis() / 2));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see the default timeout is 30 seconds, and the request timeout is 30/2 which validates the 15 seconds timeout.\r\nAlso we can see in the code how the custom values passed by the config file are overwritten by the defaults.\r\nThe proposal is easy, we need to use the defaults values only when the timeouts were not defined by the config file, for example like this:\r\n```bash\r\n      if (!props.containsKey(AdminClientConfig.DEFAULT_API_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG)) {\r\n          props.setProperty(AdminClientConfig.DEFAULT_API_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG, timeout.toMillis.toString)\r\n      }\r\n      if (!props.containsKey(AdminClientConfig.REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG)) {\r\n          props.setProperty(AdminClientConfig.REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG, (timeout.toMillis / 2).toString)\r\n      }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nI tested it and now I am able to modify the timeouts and make my application to catch the result of the command properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

start with this PR. I see how this PR can influence the test via the change in `TestUtils`. The bad part is that sometimes seems to kill the Gradle Executors completely.

a 5s limit* to the time spent in the processing loop before returning to poll while there is an active rebalance to avoid missing rebalance events, and introduce a 5s delay to the \"immediate\" followup rebalance triggered by Streams.\r\n\r\n*note, this is not a true limit and is technically more of a minimum than a maximum time spent processing, since depending on the number of iterations that Streams performs, it may process so many records that it exceeds this \"limit\" by a large amount before ever even checking it. However it should at least help the situation somewhat, and we can get smarter about the number of iterations allowed during a rebalance if need be, for example by computing an approximate \"time per iteration\" based on the current iterations and max poll limit (half the `max.poll.interval.ms` per the processing algorithm) and then working backwards from the active-rebalance target processing time limit to get an active-rebalance num

avoid creating lots of small KRaft batches during the ZK migration, this patch adds a mechanism to merge batches into sizes of at least 1000. This has the effect of reducing the number of batches sent to Raft which reduces the amount of time spent blocking. \r\n\r\nSince migrations use metadata transactions, the batch boundaries for migrated records are not significant. Even in light of that, this implementation does not break up existing batches. It will only combine them into a larger batch to meet the minimum size.

Example of such failure [here](https://ci-builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/Kafka%2Fkafka-pr/detail/PR-14925/11/tests/).\r\n\r\nAs a new cluster is created for each test anyway, calling `removeAllClientAcls()` does not seem necessary. This patch removes it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-13T19:24:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-19T07:48:15Z","closed_at":"2023-12-19T07:48:11Z","merged_at":"2023-12-19T07:48:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"35e2d3c1963a4234bf7f2d23e9925a3e7d1f55ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/0dfbeb8d52ddf31bb9a7811c7c923786a17ec231","head":{"label":"dajac:minor-fix-leak-in-auth-integration-tests","ref":"minor-fix-leak-in-auth-integration-tests","sha":"0dfbeb8d52ddf31bb9a7811c7c923786a17ec231","user":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40044750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA0NDc1MA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"dajac/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dajac/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch wires the handling of makers written by the transaction coordinator via the WriteTxnMarkers API. In the old group coordinator, the markers are written to the logs and the group coordinator is informed to materialize the changes as a second step if the writes were successful. This approach does not really work with the new group coordinator for mainly two reasons: 1) The second step would actually fail while the coordinator is loading and there is no guarantee that the loading has picked up the write or not; 2) It does not fit well with the new memory model where the state is snapshotted by offset. In both cases, it seems that having a single writer to the `__consumer_offsets` partitions is more robust and preferable.\r\n\r\nTests are missing at the moment. I will add them during the week.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

multiple addresses are available. This change is a follow-up to #9902. When re-resolving DNS after disconnecting, it is possible (likely, even) that we will resolve the same set of addresses in the same order, meaning we could attempt to reconnect to the same IP that we just disconnected from. In the case where we disconnected from the IP address because it has become unhealthy (due to a load balancer going down or a network routing layer restarting, for example), the client will need to time out before connecting to the next IP. This essentially unifies the behavior before and after KAFKA-12193: re-resolve after disconnecting while still progressing through the IP list.\r\n\r\nCherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/47e37772c7cd947b082817653bea087f0ab7e103\r\n\r\nReviewers: Lucas Brutschy <lbrutschy@confluent.io>, Andrew Schofield <aschofield@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

because the leader returned a successful response to FETCH and FETCH_SNAPSHOT doesn't mean that the followers were able to handle the response correctly.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine the case where the log end offset (LEO) is at 1000 and all of the followers are continuously fetching at offset 0 without ever increasing their fetch offset. This can happen if the followers encounter an error when processing the FETCH or FETCH_SNAPSHOT response.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `isFetchOffsetAdvanced` and `isFetchSnapshotPositionAdvanced` to fix this potential issue.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

defines the `offset.lag.max` configuration, which defines a target interval between offset syncs emitted to the offset syncs topics.\r\n\r\nThe actual number of offset syncs may be more frequent, if:\r\n1. The connector restarts and hasn't emitted an offset sync yet.\r\n2. The upstream topic has a gap in it (such as from a transaction marker)\r\n3. The downstream topic experiences a truncation\r\n\r\nAnd the actual number of offset syncs may be less frequent, if:\r\n1. The throttling semaphore delays the sync long enough that it can't be emitted before another sync takes it's place.\r\n\r\nThis is insufficient for finite-length and low-throughput topics, where re-reading `offset.lag.max` records is undesirable.\r\nIn these situations, the replication & offset translation mechanisms may be healthy for hours, and still a persistent lag is present.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds \"time-based\" offset syncs: The latest offset sync that could be emitted for a topic is emitted every `offset.flush.interval.ms`, which has a default setting of 60 seconds. This means that if a record is mirrored, between 0 and 60 seconds later the connector will attempt to emit an offset sync for that record. \r\n\r\nThis contributes N messages/minute to the offset syncs topic in addition to the existing sync throughput. These syncs will be fairly throttled within the existing budget set by the offset sync semaphore, so for MM2 clusters with high numbers of topics, this should still be a manageable sync volume.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

a similar approach to the existing [ConnectorRestartApiIntegrationTest suite](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/c062e5a1f91f44c721072a29b533304d58c487ab/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/integration/ConnectorRestartApiIntegrationTest.java#L83-L129), embedded Kafka clusters and embedded Connect clusters that use the same worker configs are reused across test cases.\r\n\r\nAccording to our Gradle Enterprise setup, this cuts the total runtime for the `OffsetsApiIntegrationTest` suite to less than a quarter of its current value:\r\n- [Test runs for this PR](https://ge.apache.org/scans/tests?search.tags=PR-14966&tests.container=org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.OffsetsApiIntegrationTest&tests.unstableOnly=false) average 5 minutes and 22 seconds\r\n- [Test runs on trunk](https://ge.apache.org/scans/tests?search.tags=trunk&tests.container=org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.OffsetsApiIntegrationTest&tests.unstableOnly=false) average 24 minutes and 22 seconds\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce possible interference across test cases, the name of the connector and the topic it interacts with for each case is derived from the name of the test case. In the same vein, overridden sink connector group IDs and source connector offsets topics are also derived from the name of the test case.\r\n\r\nAlthough the diff is a few hundred lines long, it mostly boils down to these simple changes:\r\n- Replace the `CONNECTOR_NAME` constant with the `connectorName` field\r\n- Replace the `TOPIC` constant with the `topic` field\r\n- Replace hardcoded overridden sink connector consumer group IDs and source connector offsets topics with names that now include the test case\r\n- Add an internal API to reuse `EmbeddedConnectCluster` instances (based on their worker configs) across tests, which also reuses their underlying `EmbeddedKafkaCluster` instances\r\n- Add cleanup logic at the end of each test to delete the test-specific connector, and fail the test if any other leaked connectors are found\r\n\r\nThe last point does mean that we may double the number of concurrently-running embedded Kafka and Connect clusters. With local testing, this was worth the tradeoff: test runtime decreased from 6 minutes and 17 seconds to 3 minutes and 27 seconds. However, it may still be worth exploring an improvement in the future where we order tests by the kind of embedded Connect cluster they require, and bring down any currently-running embedded Connect cluster before bringing up a new one.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, we may also consider applying this improvement to other existing integration test suites.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

on other PRs. \r\n\r\nAdd support for EOSv1:\r\n - to setup the Futures for task producers, we need to delegate creating the Futurs to `StreamThread` (we cannot do it within `clientInstanceIds()` but push into the main processing loop via `maybeGetClientInstanceIds()` to avoid race conditions with rebalancing\r\n - We also need to take care for rebalancing and changing tasks\r\n   - if we get new tasks, we just ignore it for now (what I think is not totally correct yet... -- not 100% sure right now what the best approach is)\r\n   - if we lose a task, we just clean it out by completing the future inside `StreamTask#close()` (in the end, the user facing call will always timeout anyway, but completing the `Futures` with `null` seem to be a good idea in

the new consumer, the commit request manager and the membership manager are separate components.
