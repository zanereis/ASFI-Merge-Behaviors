What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds protection against IOException (IOE) scenarios when reading the `BasicFileAttributes` of a file in the `deleteRecursivelyUsingJavaIO` method: it catches the IOE and returns null, and silently handles the scenario where `fileAttributes` is null in the subsequent logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the inode itself does not exist, it is impossible to read its `BasicFileAttributes`, and an IOException (IOE) will be thrown, which caused the failure of the MacOS daily test:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12622568770/job/35170636435\r\n\r\n```\r\n- JobArtifactSet uses resources from SparkContext *** FAILED ***\r\n  java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException:

...\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49347 aimed to fix the cleanup of symbolic links by moving the operation to read `BasicFileAttributes` before `!file.exists` to add a check for broken symbolic links. However, in Spark, there is a logic that first cleans up the potentially existing destination path before overwriting it. The target path being cleaned up may itself be a non-existent inode, such as:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/91f3fdd25852b43095dd5273358fc394ffd11b66/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkContext.scala#L1879-L1888\r\n\r\nTherefore, additional protection is needed for this scenario to maintain compatibility with the old behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch removes task serialization when scheduling tasks for local executor backend. The tasks are directly passed to the local executor to run.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark serializes tasks and attaches serialized tasks in task description before submitting tasks to executors. For remote executor backends, this is necessary. But for local executor backend, it runs in same JVM with master. It seems that task serialization for local executor backend is not necessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManual test local mode.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR change to use `Thread.interrupt()` instead of `Thread.stop()` to attempt to interrupt the execution of `TransformWithStateInPandasPythonPreInitRunner#daemonThread`. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, logic has been added in `TransformWithStateInPandasStateServer#run` to respond to the interrupt by setting the `CLOSED` state and exiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `Thread.stop` method in Java 21 directly throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`, which led to the failure of the Java 21 daily tests:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12511573912/job/34903859772\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12523542188/job/34933207012\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12592534465/job/35097321533\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75cef6d7-d66a-4652-b01d-38412d6db3b0)\r\n\r\nSo the primary purpose of this change is to restore the daily tests for Java 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Pass Java 21 GitHub Action test: https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/actions/runs/12606699142/job/35137180872\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5e8b08-d167-4f7a-959c-8ebe6e22f9bc)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2025-01-04T02:29:01Z","updated_at":"2025-01-05T14:11:42Z","closed_at":"2025-01-04T21:30:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f913e4f8aec74e39b7aa3e0bb3d52b2031327251","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24d170138246003a19f2e4893334a54446cc773b","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:java21-test-2","ref":"java21-test-2","sha":"24d170138246003a19f2e4893334a54446cc773b","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49234 changed the `setSchema` method of ParquetWriteSupport to add a shredding schema parameter. To avoid the risk of breaking libraries that call `setSchema`, this PR instead creates a separate `setShreddingSchema` method to set the shredding schema. If not called, shredding will not be used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid breaking API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the feature has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-03T18:23:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T02:33:07Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T02:33:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e286a7a3fd8c9b3b7c4372c04a278afadc5654e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a987292f9c998cc6dd79d08a030ea420c4e35655","head":{"label":"cashmand:fix_set_schema","ref":"fix_set_schema","sha":"a987292f9c998cc6dd79d08a030ea420c4e35655","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284 to make the CTE inline decision smarter.\r\n\r\nThis is a very complicated issue so we need to provide some background. A CTE relation can only be referenced by other CTE relations that are defined after it in the same `WithCTE` (sibling CTE relations can contain nested `WithCTE` that reference this CTE relation), or by the main query of this `WithCTE`. Following this definition, let's look at some examples.\r\n\r\nCase 0:\r\n```\r\nWITH\r\nt1 AS (...),\r\nt2 AS (...)\r\nSELECT t1\r\n```\r\n`t1` is referenced but `t2` is not. There is no connection between `t1` and `t2`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCase 1:\r\n```\r\nWITH\r\nt1 AS (...),\r\nt2 AS (SELECT * FROM t1)\r\n```\r\nThis is clear that `t2` references `t1`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\n```\r\nWITH\r\nt1 AS (...),\r\nt2 AS (\r\n  WITH\r\n    t3 AS (SELECT * FROM t1)\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis is also clear that `t3` references `t1`, and `t2` also references `t1` but indirectly via `t3`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCase 3:\r\n```\r\nWITH\r\nt1 AS (\r\n  WITH\r\n    t2 AS (...),\r\n    t3 AS (SELECT * t2)\r\n  SELECT t3\r\n)\r\n```\r\n`t3` references `t2`, but `t1` references no one. It contains the whole `WithCTE` that defines `t2` and `t3`, but \"contains\" is not \"reference\".\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs you can see, CTE reference has a lineage, which this PR uses to update the ref counts: A CTE relation keeps track of all the relations it references directly, so that when this CTE relation is optimized out, we can decrease the ref counts for the relations it references. However, the referenced CTE relations may come from outer CTEs, and we track the lineage of the reference up to the `WithCTE` that defines the being-referenced CTE relation. If any relation on the lineage is optimized out, we will trace down to the bottom-most CTE relation that triggers direct reference, and adjust the ref counts.\r\n\r\nFor the case 2 above, `t3`'s `outgoingRefs` contains `t1`, but `t2`'s `outgoingRefs` does not. Since `t1` is defined in the same `WithCTE` of `t2`, so the reference lineage is `t2` -> `t3` -> `t1`. `t2` will put `t3` into its `indirectOutgoingRefSources`. If `t2` is referenced but `t3` is not, we will still decrease the ref count of `t1`. If `t2` is not referenced but `t3` is, we will still decrease the ref count of `t1`, because we will find `t3` in `t2`'s `indirectOutgoingRefSources`. If neither of `t2` and `t3` is referenced, we will decrease the ref count of `t1` twice, but the second decrement will be noop as `t3` will clear its `outgoingRefs` after one decrement.\r\n\r\nFor the case 3 above, `t3`'s `outgoingRefs` contains `t2`, and that's all. If `t1` is not referenced, we don't update any ref count, but just remove `t1` from the main query plan. If `t3` is not referenced, we update ref count as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

Changes in ResolveWithCTE.scala to have the analyzer grok recursive anchors. Specifically we substitute CTERelationRef with UnionLoopRef, and Union with UnionLoop. We untangle the dead loop in resolving where recursive CTE reference is referring to an unresolved CTE definition, which itself cannot be resolved as one of its descendants is an unresolved CTE reference. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport for the recursive CTE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nProposed changes in this PR are no-op.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR supports external shuffle service enablement in local-cluster mode. Unlike the real cluster, where there is only one external shuffle service in each node, there could be multiple shuffle service in a local cluster. To support this, we have to use the dynamic port rather than the fixed port (`spark.shuffle.service.port`) to start the shuffle servieces. And so, worker would pass this dynamic port via a environment variable (`TESTING_EXTERNAL_SHUFFLE_SERVICE_PORT`) to the executor process since the fixed shuffle service port is no-longer valid. This also becomes an issue to `BlockManagerMaster`, which could also not use the fixed port anymore. So this PR adds a new RPC `GetShuffleServicePort` for retrieving the dynamic port from executor to driver. Another similar issue is that `DBProvider` uses the fixed persist file name in shuffle service. This PR changes it be unique by inserting a uuid under test mode only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis allows Spark developers to test features (e.g., shuffle data / rdd fetch via shuffle service) with the real external shuffle service, which is more close to the production environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated `ExternalShuffleServiceSuite` (removed the mock of the external shuffle service).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Change to use `Files.readAttributes(file.toPath(), BasicFileAttributes.class, LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS)` to read the `BasicFileAttributes` of the file. By specifying `LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS`, the attributes of the symbolic link itself are read, rather than those of the file it points to. This allows us to use `fileAttributes.isSymbolicLink()` to check if a file is a symbolic link.\r\n\r\n2. After the above change, it is no longer possible for `fileAttributes.isDirectory()` and `fileAttributes.isSymbolicLink()` to be true simultaneously. Therefore, when `fileAttributes.isDirectory()` is true, there is no need to check `!fileAttributes.isSymbolicLink()`.\r\n\r\n3. When `fileAttributes.isSymbolicLink()` is true, deletion behavior for the symbolic link has been added.\r\n\r\n4. When `!file.exists()` is true, an additional check for `!fileAttributes.isSymbolicLink()` has been added. This is because for a broken symbolic link, `file.exists()` will also return false, but in such cases, we should proceed with the cleanup.\r\n\r\n5. The previously handwritten `isSymlink` method in JavaUtils has been removed, as it is no longer needed after the above changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the cleanup logic for symbolic links in `JavaUtils.deleteRecursivelyUsingJavaIO` method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub

currently this function is used in both PS and non-PS modules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nActually, PS with Pandas < 2.2.0 has already been broken in master branch\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, doc-only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the connect server will, by default, tombstone all sessions that have either been released explicitly (through a `ReleaseSession` request) or cleaned up due to inactivity/idleness in periodic checks.\r\n\r\nTombstoning prevents clients from reconnecting with the same `userId` and `sessionId`. This mechanism ensures that clients do not accidentally end up with a 'fresh' server-side session, which may be disastrous/fatal as all previously held state is lost (e.g., Temporary views, temporary UDFs, modified configs, current catalog, etc.).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConsider a client that runs simple non-state dependant queries (e.g `select count from ...`), perhaps sparsely during the lifetime of the application. Such a client may prefer to opt out of tombstoning for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- Queries do not depend on any custom server-side state.\r\n- Modifying `userId`/`sessionId` on each reconnect may be inconvenient for tracking/observability purposes. \r\n- On resource-constrained servers, clients may want to minimize their memory footprint by explicitly releasing their state, especially when they believe their requests are sparsely spread out.\r\n  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way to allow clients to reconnect is to set `spark.connect.session.manager.closedSessionsTombstonesSize` to `0`. However, this is not ideal as it would allow all clients to reconnect, which as previously pointed out, may be dangerous.\r\n \r\nAs an improvement, allowing specific clients to explicitly signal/request the reconnection possibility addresses the needs mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nWhen the client releases a session with `allow_reconnect` set to `true`, a reconnection will lead to the server generation a fresh session and not result in an error like `[INVALID_HANDLE.SESSION_CLOSED] The handle 271dab46-a9a0-4458-ad3a-71442eaa9a21 is invalid. Session was closed. SQLSTATE: HY000`\r\n\r\nFull example (gRPC based):\r\n\r\n#### Default/`allow_reconnect` set to `false`\r\n\r\nCreate a session via a `Config` request:\r\n```gRPC\r\n{\r\n    \"operation\": {\r\n        \"get\": {\r\n            \"keys\": [\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"]\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"session_id\": \"271dab46-a9a0-4458-ad3a-71442eaa9a21\",\r\n    \"user_context\": {\r\n        \"user_id\": \"vicennial\",\r\n        \"user_name\": \"Akhil\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelease session via `ReleaseSession` request:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"session_id\": \"271dab46-a9a0-4458-ad3a-71442eaa9a21\",\r\n    \"user_context\": {\r\n        \"user_id\": \"vicennial\",\r\n        \"user_name\": \"Akhil\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"allow_reconnect\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetry the earlier config request, the error `[INVALID_HANDLE.SESSION_CLOSED] The handle 271dab46-a9a0-4458-ad3a-71442eaa9a21 is invalid. Session was closed. SQLSTATE: HY000` is hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Default/`allow_reconnect` set to `true`\r\nCreate a session via a `Config` request:\r\n```gRPC\r\n{\r\n    \"operation\": {\r\n        \"get\": {\r\n            \"keys\": [\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\"]\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"session_id\": \"ff1410b9-0a75-4634-820a-b46c14f30896\",\r\n    \"user_context\": {\r\n        \"user_id\": \"vicennial\",\r\n        \"user_name\": \"Akhil\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelease session via `ReleaseSession` request:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"session_id\": \"ff1410b9-0a75-4634-820a-b46c14f30896\",\r\n    \"user_context\": {\r\n        \"user_id\": \"vicennial\",\r\n        \"user_name\": \"Akhil\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"allow_reconnect\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetry the earlier config request, the request goes through and it can be noted the `server_side_session_id` in the response of the last config request is different from the first one as a new server side session was generated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRegisters a `java.lang.ref.Cleaner` for `ArtifactManager`. `ArtifactManager#cleanUpResources` is further made thread-safe and swallows FileSystem exceptions in order to let the remaining cleanup go through.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, an instance of ArtifactManager's resources isn't cleaned up automatically during its GC. Previously, Artifact Manager was only used in Spark Connect, where its lifetime was controlled by the Spark Connect Session which would manually call `ArtifactManager#cleanUpResources` when it itself is closed.\r\n\r\nWith the recent changes allowing the artifact manager to be used in 'Classic Spark', we should GC related resources when the SparkSession gets GCed (and thus, the ArtifactManager instance is no longer reachable)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-31T11:59:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T14:10:50Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T10:33:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3de1c0b7303fd1b2f41d5b66f8e244a027ea6e5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/570dbcfb9210c9c4eeb464986ed038791e2f294d","head":{"label":"vicennial:artifactGC","ref":"artifactGC","sha":"570dbcfb9210c9c4eeb464986ed038791e2f294d","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnable casting to/from char/varchar.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `cast` does not work correctly. It always casts to `StringType`. This PR enables casting to `CharType` and `VarcharType`. This only applies when `spark.sql.preserveCharVarcharTypeInfo` is set to `true`. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. \r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in:\r\n- `CharVarcharTestSuite`\r\n- `CastSuiteBase`\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo. \r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-31T10:58:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-12T20:39:44Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T13:26:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3cd3d800d555db2f6fdfd78daef2445749589f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dbebe153896c261eecbff88c1561dce1480a69be","head":{"label":"jovanm-db:char_varchar_cast","ref":"char_varchar_cast","sha":"dbebe153896c261eecbff88c1561dce1480a69be","user":{"login":"jovanm-db","id":184946754,"node_id":"U_kgDOCwYQQg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184946754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/jovanm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":873523318,"node_id":"R_kgDONBDodg","name":"spark","full_name":"jovanm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jovanm-db","id":184946754,"node_id":"U_kgDOCwYQQg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184946754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/jovanm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jovanm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jovanm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects the `isRowEncoderSupported` logic of `encoderFor` method. Now when the flag is off, `encoderFor` method will not return an `UnboundRowEncoder` but instead throws an exception. To get back to the old behaviour, used one of the following two method instead:\r\n\r\n- `encoderFor(..., isRowEncoderSupported = true)`\r\n- `encoderForWithRowEncoderSupport(...)`\r\n\r\nTo avoid breaking existing use cases, this PR changes some calls of `encoderFor` to `encoderForWithRowEncoderSupport` when the input type involves generic `T`, since `T` can be a `Row`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCode cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This method is used internally.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-31T10:40:39Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T19:37:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a43faf1fe5b3288a6a36d1a9f235893e2069c97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f357c611af3a0f6aa342854384eb4a7c2a9d1e3f","head":{"label":"xupefei:no-row-encoder","ref":"no-row-encoder","sha":"f357c611af3a0f6aa342854384eb4a7c2a9d1e3f","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a magic value `builtin`(and sets it to the default value) for `spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, `spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog` is optional and has `None` as the default value. When `spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=a.bad.catalog.impl` is wrongly set in `spark-defaults.conf`, the user has no way to overwrite it in `spark-submit`.\r\n\r\nNote that, explicitly setting it to `o.a.s.sql.execution.datasources.v2.V2SessionCatalog` does not work either, because `V2SessionCatalog` does not have a zero-args constructor.\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n  --conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.V2SessionCatalog \\\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix the above issue, similar to what we did for `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars`, just use \"builtin\" to represent the built-in `V2SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo change for default behavior, and users are allowed to use  `spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=builtin` to set `spark_catalog` as the built-in `V2SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nCode in UTs like\r\n```\r\n// unset this config to use the default v2 session catalog.\r\nspark.conf.unset(V2_SESSION_CATALOG_IMPLEMENTATION.key)\r\n```\r\nare replaced with\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(V2_SESSION_CATALOG_IMPLEMENTATION, \"builtin\")\r\n```\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-30T07:50:16Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T03:29:46Z","closed_at":"2025-01-06T03:28:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"922d70ee3d8f8116df27e2b8c94e6f3b2c809cbc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4491c38c609094c70659ec64b2683c11d8c1dd9","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-50700","ref":"SPARK-50700","sha":"e4491c38c609094c70659ec64b2683c11d8c1dd9","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes RPAD and LPAD functions translatable across connectors. Individual connectors can now support them via their dialects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen trying to compare CHAR(...) and a literal, Spark injects a RPAD function to make the CHAR parameter the same length. This behaviour is per ANSI standard.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that RPAD is not only an unsupported, but an untranslatable function. This prevents CHAR + literal comparison pushdown.\r\n\r\nSolution is to support RPAD pushdowns and implement it when needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR only introduces the ability to support the RPAD pushdown.

Optionally, we could rename `ForeachWriterPacket` to something more general for both cases.\r\n\r\nIn `SparkConnectPlanner` / `StreamingForeachBatchHelper`\r\n- Use the encoder passed from the client to recover the Dataset[T] object to properly call the foreachBatch function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout the fix, Scala foreachBatch will fail or give wrong results when the input dataset is not a DataFrame.\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple reproduction:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nspark.range(10).write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/tmp/test\")\r\n\r\nval q = spark.readStream.format(\"parquet\").schema(\"id LONG\").load(\"/tmp/test\").as[java.lang.Long].writeStream.foreachBatch((ds: Dataset[java.lang.Long], batchId: Long) => println(ds.collect().map(_.asInstanceOf[Long]).sum)).start()\r\n\r\nThread.sleep(1000)\r\nq.stop()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above should output 45 in the foreachBatch function. Without the fix, the code will fail because the foreachBatch function will be called with a DataFrame object instead of Dataset[java.lang.Long].\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR includes fixes to the Spark Connect client (we add the encoder to the foreachBatch function during serialization) around the foreachBatch API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Run end-to-end test with spark-shell (with spark connect server and client running in connect mode).\r\n2. New / updated unit tests that would have failed without the fix.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-27T15:23:14Z","updated_at":"2024-12-28T07:21:03Z","closed_at":"2024-12-28T07:21:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"821a0b9303ed4eb8b0ef315d453c01d2b57b0259","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `UnsafeProjection` for `LocalRelation` rows instead of `ComparableLocalRelation`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`UnsafeRow.equals` compares the whole byte sequence under it, so it's a convenient way to compare all kind of row values, including `ArrayBasedMapData`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReopening the [PR ](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47031)done by [Ronserruya](https://github.com/Ronserruya)  and addidng small changes.\r\n\r\nAdded the option to provide a dict to `pyspark.sql.functions.lit` in order to create a map\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to create a map in pyspark.\r\nCurrently, it is only possible via `create_map` which requires a sequence of key,value,key,value...\r\nScala already supports such functionality using `typedLit`\r\n\r\nA [similar PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37722) was done in the past to add similar functionality for the creating of an array using a list, so I tried to follow all the changes done there as well.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, docstring of `lit` was edited, and new functionality was added\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\nF.lit({\"a\":1})\r\n# pyspark.errors.exceptions.captured.SparkRuntimeException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.LITERAL_TYPE] The feature is not supported: Literal for '{asd=2}' of class java.util.HashMap.\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\nF.lit({\"a\":1, \"b\": 2})\r\n# Column<'map(a, 1, b, 2)'>\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests + unittest in CI\r\n\r\n## Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-12-27T12:31:56Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T10:06:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45e7be55d3f77c28bd4152c10ab015077ba9d1ed","head":{"label":"skanderboudawara:dev_sbu_SPARK-48665","ref":"dev_sbu_SPARK-48665","sha":"45e7be55d3f77c28bd4152c10ab015077ba9d1ed","user":{"login":"skanderboudawara","id":108568261,"node_id":"U_kgDOBniexQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108568261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara","html_url":"https://github.com/skanderboudawara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":908967190,"node_id":"R_kgDONi29Fg","name":"spark","full_name":"skanderboudawara/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skanderboudawara","id":108568261,"node_id":"U_kgDOBniexQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108568261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara","html_url":"https://github.com/skanderboudawara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skanderboudawara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skanderboudawara/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to optimize the logic to get stack traces for DataFrameQueryContext by avoid using `inspect.getframeinfo` that is slow.\r\n\r\n```\r\n     8000    0.019    0.000    0.976    0.000 inspect.py:1658()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe main overhead is from `inspect.getframeinfo` so this PR directly uses the frames from `inspect.currentframe`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt improves the performance of `DataFrameQueryContext`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport cProfile\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\r\n\r\n\r\ndef foo():\r\n    for _ in range(1000):\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdded deallocation of internal array which is redundant in certain hash to sort aggregation fallback scenarios\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnder memory pressure, allocation of new internal structures is oom-prone. So, it is better to get rid of all the redundant structures at that point to reduce the risk. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnsafeKVExternalSuite spilling tests have been adjusted to the reduced spilled memory introduced by the change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a retry of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49054 that avoids hacky monkey patch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- This disables DataFrameQueryContext for `pyspark.sql.functions` too\r\n- It avoids circular import in pyspark-connect package.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after this followup, `spark.python.sql.dataFrameDebugging.enabled` also works with `pyspark.sql.functions.*`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran profilers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport cProfile\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\r\n\r\n\r\ndef foo():\r\n    for _ in range(1000):\r\n        col(\"id\")\r\n\r\n\r\ncProfile.run('foo()',

ownership and also expose internal/non-internal key metrics correctly.\r\nWith this change, we have the following:\r\n- encoder is only responsible for managing encoding based on type such as noPrefix, prefix, range etc\r\n- the onus of maintaining virtual col families is now with the underlying DB layer\r\n- this layer can now also expose metrics for internal as well as non-internal column families\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting Unit tests and added unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe version of Guava being used by Spark is 33.3.1 now, so this pr cleans up the outdated check rules from `dev/checkstyle.xml` and `scalastyle-config.xml`\r\n-  The current version of Guava no longer has the `Objects.toStringHelper` method, so this check rule is no longer needed\r\n- CVE-2020-8908 has been fixed after version 32.0.0, so the related check is no longer needed\r\n- CVE-2023-2976 has been fixed after version 32.0.0, so the related check is no longer needed\r\n- CVE-2018-10237 has been fixed after version 24.1.1, so the related check is no longer needed\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up outdated style check rules related to Guava\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass Github Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

spark.conf[\"spark.sql.optimizer.runtime.rowLevelOperationGroupFilter.enabled\"].desc()\r\n\"Enables runtime group filtering for group-based row-level operations. Data sources that replace groups of data (e.g. files, partitions) may prune entire groups using provided data source filters when planning a row-level operation scan. However, such filtering is limited as not all expressions can be converted into data source filters and some expressions can only be evaluated by Spark (e.g. subqueries). Since rewriting groups is expensive, Spark can execute a query at runtime to find what records match the condition of the row-level operation. The information about matching records will be passed back to the row-level operation scan, allowing data sources to discard groups that don't have to be rewritten.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.conf.spark.sql.optimizer.runtime.rowLevelOperationGroupFilter.enabled.version()\r\n'3.4.0'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide Pythonic ways of setting options. This is also supported in pandas as a reference (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/options.html).\r\n\r\nThis should be pretty useful for interactive shell users in a way that they do not have

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe mostly use the `Cast` expression to implement the cast, but we need some custom logic for certain type combinations. We already have special handling for `long/decimal -> timestamp` in `VariantGet.cast`, so we should do the same thing in `ScalarCastHelper` to ensure consistency. `ScalarCastHelper` also needs special handling for `decimal -> string` to strip any trailing zeros.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo ensure that cast on shredded variant has the same semantics as cast on unshredded variant.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. They would fail without the change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-12-25T22:43:45Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T07:24:30Z","closed_at":"2024-12-26T07:24:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a76a7f49a77ecd71392ff1b454c12ffc4df61f65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9fafdfa878af3658e6e204a24ab3d44696a11071","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:fix_shredded_cast","ref":"fix_shredded_cast","sha":"9fafdfa878af3658e6e204a24ab3d44696a11071","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf a SparkContext fails during initialization (for example, due to invalid Spark configs), the driver’s RpcEnv may have already started but never gets stopped, because SparkContext’s _env field is still null and _env.stop() is not invoked in the catch block. As a result, the RPC server port remains bound indefinitely in that process. This PR adds logic to ensure that if the RPC server is partially created and a SparkContext constructor error occurs, we properly shut down the RpcEnv so it does not remain open.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Fixes a resource leak where an RPC port remains bound if SparkContext’s initialization fails.\r\n- Ensures consistent cleanup in error scenarios, preventing indefinite port binding for a failed SparkContext.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Internal fix only; no visible API changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- WIP\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-25T21:13:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T14:53:43Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96887ee00b4e8b6f422a7adc5f2ca05103f0ca8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ac8861cad3e9115fbc080d1a53852c51cc7e07b","head":{"label":"soumasish:SPARK-48334","ref":"SPARK-48334","sha":"3ac8861cad3e9115fbc080d1a53852c51cc7e07b","user":{"login":"soumasish","id":8686095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODYwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8686095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish","html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146815011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY4MTUwMTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"soumasish/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"soumasish","id":8686095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODYwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8686095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish","html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soumasish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/soumasish/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR the signature of `TimestampAdd` function was changed from `IntegerType` to `LongType` for quantity parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow long types to be passed to timestamp_add function. Currently passing anything larger then `Int32.MaxValue` will cause a cast overflow exception. There is no need to restrict this method to only in32 values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the following query passes:\r\n```sql\r\nselect\r\n  timestampadd(\r\n    millisecond,\r\n    1733011227403,\r\n    timestamp '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'\r\n  )\r\n```\r\nAbove query now returns `2024-12-01T00:00:27.000+00:00` instead of throwing a cast exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSubstitute `LocalRelation` with `ComparableLocalRelation` in `NormalizePlan`.\r\n\r\n`ComparableLocalRelation` has `Seq[Seq[Expression]]` instead of `Seq[InternalRow]`. The conversion happens through `Literal`s.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`LocalRelation`'s data field is incomparable if it contains maps, because `ArrayBasedMapData` doesn't define `equals`: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13847\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is to compare logical plans in the single-pass Analyzer.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\ncopilot.nvim.","created_at":"2024-12-24T23:02:11Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T02:52:07Z","closed_at":"2024-12-26T02:52:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24c15924cda1fd08b22d6e0f8ec233babf0c187c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da832dad6b1601eb31595005dd72fa93715b9a60","head":{"label":"vladimirg-db:vladimirg-db/normalize-local-relation","ref":"vladimirg-db/normalize-local-relation","sha":"da832dad6b1601eb31595005dd72fa93715b9a60","user":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":833519707,"node_id":"R_kgDOMa6AWw","name":"spark","full_name":"vladimirg-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPer request from this comment, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48355/files#r1866546734, we will put `None` in the `stateUniqueIds` of `CommitMetadata` when in V1. So now the logic is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In V1, `CommitMetadata.stateUniqueIds = None` for all stateful and stateless queries\r\n2. In V2, `CommitMetadata.stateUniqueIds = Some(Map.empty)` for stateless queries\r\n3. In V2, `CommitMetadata.stateUniqueIds = Some(<non-empty-map>)` for stateful queries\r\n\r\nAlso removed the legacy test as a side effect\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces stateful schema evolution for the TransformWithState operator when Avro is used.\r\nWe modified the StateStoreColumnFamilySchema and the StateSchemaV3 file to keep track of the key schema and value schema id in order to support versioning and lookups of schemas across query restarts.\r\nThe AvroStateEncoder now takes a StateSchemaProvider, which allows it to look up all of the active schemas in the StateStore for a given column family, allowing it to pass reader and writer schemas to the AvroEncoder class.\r\nWe have also added changes so that the StateDataSource can read from these rows with schema ID\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSchema evolution is a critical feature for stateful stream processing applications that need to handle changing data schemas over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes - this change allows stateful schema evolution that was not previously possible for the TransformWithState operator.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit and Integration tests in RocksDBStateStoreSuite and TransformWithStateSuite\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe change improves warning logging in the CacheManager by:\r\n1. Adds logical plan info to the existing warning messages.\r\n2. Logs warning message in case an attempt is made to remove data from the cache, but data is not present.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe change helps to identify incorrect calls to `Dataset.persist()` and `Dataset.unpersist()` as in \r\n```\r\nDataset<Row> dataset = ...\r\nDataset<Row> dataset1 = dataset.withColumn(...);\r\nDataset<Row> dataset2 = dataset1.withColumn(...);\r\ndataset.persist(); // OK\r\ndataset1.persist(); // OK\r\ndataset.persist(); // currently logs warning without logical plan details\r\ndataset.unpersist(); // OK\r\ndataset.unpersist(); // no warning\r\ndataset2.unpersist(); // no warning, the actual call should be on dataset1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers may see warning messages like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n23.12.2024 19:15:03.840 WARN  [pool-30-thread-1] org.apache.spark.sql.execution.CacheManager - An attempt was made to cache data even though the data had already been cached. Please un-cache data or clear cache first.\r\nLogical plan:\r\nRelation [i#0] JDBCRelation(test_table) [numPartitions=1]\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n23.12.2024 19:15:04.207 WARN  [pool-30-thread-1] org.apache.spark.sql.execution.CacheManager - Data has not been previously cached or it was removed from the cache already.\r\nLogical plan:\r\nProject [i#0, i#0 AS year#6]\r\n+- Relation [i#0] JDBCRelation(test_table) [numPartitions=1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe change modifies warning log messages.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-23T19:32:27Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T13:19:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89792f78303032bab50ccbce6406bcef7fc94af0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49276/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49276/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49276/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6d02c38b720e25ac7c6c53a75674b894f05684b","head":{"label":"vrozov:Warning","ref":"Warning","sha":"c6d02c38b720e25ac7c6c53a75674b894f05684b","user":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":899688964,"node_id":"R_kgDONaAqBA","name":"spark","full_name":"vrozov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vrozov","id":12200381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjAwMzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12200381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov","html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vrozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vrozov/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new Protobuf field `is_internal` to `UnresolvedFunction` message. This field is used to carry the info on whether an `UnresolvedFunction` is calling an internal function (using the `Column#internalFn` API), so that the Connect server could act appropriately:\r\n\r\n- If `true`, then (inside Catalyst) mark the function as internal.\r\n- If `false`, then mark the function as external (public or user-defined).\r\n- (Current behaviour) If not set, then look it up in the internal registry: mark as \"internal\" if found, \"external\" otherwise.\r\n\r\nTODO: [SPARK-50658](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-50658): apply the same change to the Spark Connect Python client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTidy up the code and make our first-party Connect client adhere to the best practices.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test is added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nCopilot helped generate protobuf comments and repeated test codes.","created_at":"2024-12-23T16:25:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T08:15:36Z","closed_at":"2025-01-03T08:15:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a774d23bef5a8e38754d29e6c8832d4ee526f66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9a810aab816358567d8ce0ac9691cd6acc4fc47e","head":{"label":"xupefei:internal-fn","ref":"internal-fn","sha":"9a810aab816358567d8ce0ac9691cd6acc4fc47e","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn some test cases added by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48880, `changelogReader.closeIfNeeded()` is called before `assert(entries.size == expectedEntries.size)`, while `entries` are defined as `entries = changelogReader.toSeq`, which triggers the read. \r\n\r\nSo the logic is\r\n```\r\nentries = changelogReader.toSeq\r\nchangelogReader.closeIfNeeded()\r\nassert(entries.size == expectedEntries.size)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is fine in most cases, but we find out that in certain environments, the `toSeq` is lazily evaluated; therefore, not until the `assert`, the actual read won't be triggered. To be extra safe, change the order of the above logic to be the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nentries = changelogReader.toSeq\r\nassert(entries.size == expectedEntries.size)\r\nchangelogReader.closeIfNeeded()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTest case improvement\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a problem that Spark always had. See the following section for the scenario when the problem occurs.\r\n\r\n When cancel a job, some tasks may be still running. \r\nThe reason is that when `DAGScheduler#handleTaskCompletion` encounters FetchFailed, `markStageAsFinished` will be called to remove the stage in `DAGScheduler#runningStages` (see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7cd5c4a1d1eb56fa92c10696bdbd8450d357b128/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L2059) and don't `killAllTaskAttempts`.\r\nBut `DAGScheduler#cancelRunningIndependentStages` only find `runningStages`, this will leave zombie shuffle tasks, occupying cluster resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAssume a job is stage1-> stage2, when FetchFailed occurs during the stage 2, the stage1 and stage2  will resubmit (stage2 may still have some tasks running even if stage2 is resubmitted , this is as expected, because these tasks may eventually succeed and avoid retry)\r\n\r\nBut during the execution of the stage1-retry , if the SQL is canceled, the tasks in stage1 and stage1-retry can all be killed, but the tasks previously running in stage2 are still running and can't be killed. These tasks can greatly affect cluster stability and occupy resources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixing the inconsistent behavior of casts between different collations. Currently, we are allowed to do casts between them in dataframe API but not in the SQL API. I propose allowing casts in SQL as well (we are already allowing them for complex types anyways).\r\n\r\nAlso, this means changing the behavior or `CAST(x AS STRING)` which was previously not altering the collation of `x`, and will now change it to the default collation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make collation casts between the dataframe and SQL api consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests for the dataframe API which we didn't have before and also updated the existing tests for the SQL API to match the new behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
