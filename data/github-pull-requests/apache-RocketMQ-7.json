Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\nFixes #7730.\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the suggestion in [Garret Wilson's blog](https://www.garretwilson.com/blog/2023/06/14/improve-maven-bom-pattern) on how to structure repositories containing a BOM artifact:\r\n\r\n * the `rocketmq-all` POM file is moved to `parent/pom.xml` and the `relativePath` attributes of all the other artifacts are updated,\r\n * a new `rocketmq-bom` artifact is created as parent POM for `rocketmq-all`. It contains:\r\n     - all the common metadata about the project (description, URL, mailing lists, developer list, license and issue management),\r\n     - it manages the version of all `rocketmq-*` artifacts in **this** repo and also `rocketmq-proto`,\r\n * since the URL inheritance model described in [Maven Model Builder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.9.6/maven-model-builder/) doesn't make sense for RocketMQ (e.g. the URL of each module is `https://rocketmq.org` not `https://rocketmq.org/rocketmq-all/rocketmq-common`), all the `child.*.inherit.append.path` options have been set to `false`.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nThe change was tested with a `mvn verify` step and also by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn help:effective-pom\r\n```\r\n\r\nto check that the metadata of each artifact is correct.","created_at":"2024-01-08T08:54:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T00:09:40Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"062e566b633ef325bed00ce6a21bcd828b558f44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/7732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/7732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/10cfe28cc2db04ed4c57553bf5cc94775b34ad56","head":{"label":"ppkarwasz:rocketmq-bom","ref":"rocketmq-bom","sha":"10cfe28cc2db04ed4c57553bf5cc94775b34ad56","user":{"login":"ppkarwasz","id":12533274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMzMjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12533274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz","html_url":"https://github.com/ppkarwasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":739296073,"node_id":"R_kgDOLBDDSQ","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"ppkarwasz/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ppkarwasz","id":12533274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTMzMjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12533274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz","html_url":"https://github.com/ppkarwasz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppkarwasz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ppkarwasz/rocketmq","description":"Apache

Standardized IP whitelist control: The enhanced ACL design provides a more standardized IP whitelist control mechanism. It effectively restricts user requests to specific IP sources and blocks access from untrusted IP addresses.\r\n2. Scalable ACL configuration and authentication mechanism: The improved design allows for easy extension and implementation of ACL-related logic. Users can conveniently customize and expand ACL configurations to meet their specific requirements. Additionally, the ACL design includes access control for control-related interfaces, enhancing the overall security of the system.\r\n3. Effective separation of user and permission management: The optimized design successfully achieves a clear separation between user authentication and permission management, establishing explicit responsibilities and boundaries for each. This enhancement significantly improves the security of the system. Additionally, User passwords should be stored in a non-plaintext format., effectively reducing the risk of password leaks.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nbroker

[com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm](https://github.com/square/okio) from 3.0.0 to 3.4.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/square/okio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Version 3.4.0</h2>\n<p><em>2023-07-07</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New: Adapt a Java NIO FileSystem (<code>java.nio.file.FileSystem</code>) as an Okio FileSystem using\n<code>fileSystem.asOkioFileSystem()</code>.</li>\n<li>New: Adapt Android’s <code>AssetManager</code> as an Okio FileSystem using <code>AssetFileSystem</code>. This is in the\nnew <code>okio-assetfilesystem</code> module. Android applications should prefer this over\n<code>FileSystem.RESOURCES</code> as it’s faster to load.</li>\n<li>Fix: Don't crash decoding GZIP files when the optional extra data (<code>XLEN</code>) is 32 KiB or larger.</li>\n<li>Fix: Resolve symlinks in <code>FakeFileSystem.canonicalize()</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix: Report the correct <code>createdAtMillis</code> in <code>NodeJsFileSystem</code> file metadata. We were\nincorrectly using <code>ctimeMs</code>, where <code>c</code> means <em>changed</em>, not <em>created</em>.</li>\n<li>Fix: <code>UnsafeCursor</code> is now <code>Closeable</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 3.3.0</h2>\n<p><em>2023-01-07</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Don't leak resources when <code>use {}</code> is used with a non-local return. We introduced this\nperformance and stability bug by not considering that non-local returns execute neither the\n<code>return</code> nor <code>catch</code> control flows.</li>\n<li>Fix: Use a sealed interface for <code>BufferedSink</code> and <code>BufferedSource</code>. These were never intended\nfor end-users to implement, and we're happy that Kotlin now allows us to express that in our API.</li>\n<li>New: Change internal locks from <code>synchronized</code> to <code>ReentrantLock</code> and <code>Condition</code>. We expect this\nto improve help when using Okio with Java virtual threads ([Project Loom][loom]).</li>\n<li>Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.8.0][kotlin_1_8_0].</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 3.2.0</h2>\n<p><em>2022-06-26</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix: Configure the multiplatform artifact (<code>com.squareup.okio:okio:3.x.x</code>) to depend on the\nJVM artifact (<code>com.squareup.okio:okio-jvm:3.x.x</code>) for Maven builds. This should work-around an\nissue where Maven doesn't interpret Gradle metadata.</li>\n<li>Fix: Change <code>CipherSource</code> and <code>CipherSink</code> to recover if the cipher doesn't support streaming.\nThis should work around a crash with AES/GCM ciphers on Android.</li>\n<li>New: Enable compatibility with non-hierarchical projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 3.1.0</h2>\n<p><em>2022-04-19</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.6.20][kotlin_1_6_20].</li>\n<li>New: Support [Hierarchical project structure][hierarchical_projects]. If you're using Okio in a\nmultiplatform project please upgrade your project to Kotlin 1.6.20 (or newer) to take advantage\nof this. With hierarchical projects it's easier to use properties like <code>FileSystem.SYSTEM</code> that</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
