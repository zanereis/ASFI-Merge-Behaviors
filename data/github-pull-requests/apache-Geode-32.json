Instead\r\nI turned to the \"decode\" package that's used by\r\nAnalyzeSerializablesTestBase and refactored that into a Rule that can be\r\nused by any test to load its module's class files in partially\r\ndecompiled form.  I added a couple of query methods to CompiledClass to\r\nsearch for uses of InetAddress and InetSocketAddress.getAddress().\r\n\r\nThe InetAddress test turned up 74 violations.  I removed some of these\r\nby getting rid of unnecessary code or moving it to LocalHostUtil and\r\ncategorized the other violations and moved them into a \"sanctioned\" list\r\nthat we should work on making as small as possible.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

base commits for this PR have already been approved and passed PR checks.  This revision reverts the removal of the SocketCreator InetAddress->hostname cache as it severely impacted Benchmark performance in CI runs.  Removal of that cache wasn't part of the charter for this PR, and reinstating it has no impact on the standardization of use of HostAndPort for creating connections.\r\n\r\nI have not reverted a number of places that used SocketCreator to get the hostname for localhost.  Those all go to LocalHostUtil and access the same InetAddress, which will have a cached hostname and won't affect performance.\r\n\r\nI've run Benchmark tests against the impacted tests on this branch and results show that performance is no longer affected.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

As of yet, no local reproduction of the issue is available, but work is ongoing to provide a test that can be used to debug the issue.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the hangs caused by this commit, it should be noted that no additional tests were checked in to validate the change, as required in the \"For all changes\" checklist that accompanies every PR.

Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

PR builds on the work originally submitted by Greg Green in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/geode/pull/404. Also acknowledgements to Galen\r\nO'Sullivan for addressing locking issues in that PR.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the storage model of Redis hashes and sets from one\r\nregion per each Redis key to a single hash region and single set region.\r\nThe Redis key is now also the region key and the data is stored in a Map\r\nand Set respectively in the region. Currently, the backing values do not\r\nimplement Delta changes, however this will be a future optimization.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the inability of Redis keys to contain other characters\r\ncommonly used, such as colons (':').\r\n\r\n- Add `RedisLockService` which manages a lock per key within a single\r\n  JVM. Locks are held in a WeakHasMap to allow for automatic cleanup\r\n  (prior PR work, using a pure ConcurrentHashMap, ended up leaking\r\n  memory since there is no straight-forward way to clean up unused\r\n  keys/locks).\r\n- Add new tests including concurrency tests for hashes and sets\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Greg Green <ggreen@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Ray Ingles <ringles@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Sarah Abbey <sabbey@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: John Hutchison <jhutchison@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Murtuza Boxwala <mboxwala@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Prasath Durairaj <prasathd@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Jens Deppe <jdeppe@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

reinstates the test (removes Ignore annotation) and fixes the underlying problems...\r\n\r\n    To fix the \"hang\" I reduced the locator-wait-time (seconds, not millis) in the test\r\n\r\n    I also made several other changes to fix the underlying failure:\r\n      1) add a synchronization to the services restart thread so only one\r\n      thread is active at a time\r\n      2) shut down membership cleanup executor and avoid creating multiple\r\n      TcpServer executors on auto-reconnect\r\n      3) remove setting the locator as a dependent of the\r\n      InternalDistributedSystem.  This was causing locator.stop() to be\r\n      invoked multiple times (as Dale noticed in his analysis)\r\n      4) when stopping a locator for auto-reconnect wait for it to stop in\r\n      order to avoid creating multiple restart threads when there are\r\n      cascading failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
