PR includes both updating the rat exclusion, and importing the latest changes from apache/beam-site. The import is necessary as license headers are added in https://github.com/apache/beam-site/pull/481\r\n\r\nComing up with the set of exclusions was done by examining how other Apache projects add license headers for various file types. In particular, [Apache Zepplin](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs) seemed to be a good example, and in other cases doing a [search across Apache GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22See+the+License+for+the+specific+language+governing+permissions%22+user%3Aapache+extension%3Ayml&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=).\r\n\r\nFor this PR, it is sufficient to review only `build.gradle` as other changes are simply imported from apache/beam-site. The code import follows the same process from #5641\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

have a lot of emails coming from Jenkins. There are some technical reasons why we don't really want to email:\r\n\r\n - new jobs with notifications accidentally email *everyone who has ever contributed* when they start off red\r\n - merges of web site, feature branches, etc, often end up emailing everyone\r\n - many commits are not relevant to the particular failure; we shouldn't scrape all commits\r\n - as job count scales up, email is the wrong way to manage their greenness\r\n - there are others who are being emailed for no discernable reasons, probably a misconfiguration issue\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

annotations are a mess. We want to eventually deprecate our own\r\nusage of FindBugs, but we still need to deal with the annotations\r\nbecause our dependencies (notable byte-buddy) use the annotations\r\nwithout providing the dependency. This causes compile warnings such as:\r\n\r\n  byte-buddy-1.8.11.jar(/net/bytebuddy/description/type/TypeList.class):\r\n  warning: Cannot find annotation method 'value()' in type 'SuppressFBWarnings':\r\n  class file for edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings not found\r\n\r\nTo fix these warnings, we need to include a findbugs-annotations\r\ndependency during compile which includes the SuppressFBWarnings\r\nannotation. The dependency options we currently have are:\r\n\r\n * com.google.code.findbugs:annotations:3.0.1\r\n   * Includes @SuppressFBWarnings, but licensed under LGPL\r\n * com.github.stephenc.findbugs:findbugs-annotations:1.3.9-1\r\n   * Licensed under Apache 2.0, but doesn't include @SuppressFBWarnings\r\n\r\nIt is ok to use LGPL components during the build, as long as\r\nthey don't make it into the distribution. See:\r\n * https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#prohibited\r\n * https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#optional\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

you can only `SET` pipeline options. It is convenient to provide them by default in the JDBC URI.\r\n\r\nAlternatives considered: JVM system properties in a reserved namespace like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeamsql.jdbc.pipelineoptions.key1=value1\r\nbeamsql.jdbc.pipelineoptions.key2=value2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that is global to JDBC. We could also support it or other `Properties` based approaches but I don't see a pressing need.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

adds support for `CREATE TABLE TYPE text TBLPROPERTIES '{\"format\": \"lines\"}'` to read raw lines without any sort of CSV format involved. The rabbit hole went a bit deep.\r\n\r\n - You use `{\"format\": \"csv\"}` to read CSV and set e.g. `\"csvFormat\":\"Excel\"` to do what you used to do with `format`.\r\n - Because the new options for `\"format\"` are disjoint from the old ones, I added a backwards compatibility.\r\n - I added end-to-end tests of reading and writing these variations.\r\n - I deleted tests that didn't seem to add any value.\r\n - That showed a bug where we have always been writing CSV with extra newlines, so I fixed that via added feature to TextIO\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

change includes both a registrar for the runner and the runner options. The runner registrar allows users to specify the runner by the short class name by command line (i.e., `PortableRunner`) and the options registrar allows users to specify properties of `PortablePipelineOptions` on the command line. Without the options registrars, users need to explicitly register `PortablePipelineOptions` within their pipelines and recompile in order to use these options.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

RowCoder had to iterate over the schema to determine how encode/decode Row objects. This PR adds functionality to dynamically generate a Coder class per schema that hard codes the proper encoding strategy. Simple microbenchmarks (not included in this PR) show that this new strategy is 30-40% faster for moderate schemas, and the difference is expected to be larger for complex schemas.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR allows RowCoder to bypass the validation steps when building a Row, as it's assumed that these steps were performed before encoding the Row.\r\n\r\nR:@

being more confident about various code that manipulates the pipeline, e.g. fusion code, SDF expansion, etc.\r\n\r\nDidn't add explicit tests for the validation code - it will be implicitly tested by

Any false positives will be caught by a respective pipeline, false negatives will be caught at runtime.\r\n\r\n(piggybacked here: deleted unused and empty ReferenceRunner class - the proper name for that concept is PortableRunner.
