the VM and interpreter did not support constructors as first-class objects.  For example, the following code snippet would not compile:\r\n```\r\ndef @main[A]() -> (fn(A, List[A]) -> List[A]) {\r\n  Cons\r\n}\r\n```\r\n.  The eta expansion pass in this PR remedies this problem by wrapping the constructor in a function, like so:\r\n```\r\ndef @main[A]() -> (fn(A, List[A]) -> List[A]) {\r\n  fn (%x: A, %xs: List[A]) -> List[A] {\r\n    Cons(%x, %xs)  \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n.  There was an existing eta expansion pass, but it was not recursive and only operated on global variables.  The new pass is configurable, so you can choose to expand constructors, global variables, or both.\r\n\r\nAlso included are the following minor changes:\r\n\r\n- Fix `LambdaLift` pass so it closes over free type variables.\r\n- Fix `LambdaLift` pass so it reuses lifted functions that are alpha equal.\r\n- Fix pretty printing of constructors to be context-sensitive (e.g., print `Cons(A, List[A])` in a type definition but only print `Cons` when in an expr).\r\n- Rename `Module::HasDef` to `Module::ContainGlobalTypeVar` to match the analogous `Module::ContainGlobalVar` method.\r\n- Change prelude definitions to use first-class constructors where applicable.\r\n\r\nCC @jroesch @MarisaKirisame @icemelon9

opt_level for legalize is set at 0 currently. We did this because we wanted to ensure that QNN (or dialects) can run there legalize functions before starting the Relay passes.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should have legalize opt_level atleast 1. The main reason is that if there is a graph that is just Relay (no dialect), we will run Legalize function for it. This is against the opt_level=0 expectation, where no performance optimization should be done. It means that Dialects will now have to run at least at opt_level=1, but I think that is a reasonable trade-off.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @zhiics @tqchen

PR is a sizable expansion to the relay frontend for Onnx. It includes new operators that allow BERT models using both opset-8 and opset-10 to be converted and run.\r\n\r\nHere is a breakdown of all significant changes included in this PR.\r\n\r\n- Newer opsets of ONNX support quite a bit of dynamism in inputs. This manifests in some operations having expressions when the relay equivalent requires hard values. To handle these cases, I use the infer_values function from the tensorflow frontend. To reduce code reuse, I have moved this function to common.py.\r\n- I've added an extension to infer_values (infer_values_simulated). This function allows value inference even when not all inputs are defined by creating a dummy version with random values. This is needed in some cases when the value of the inputs doesn't effect the value of a shape tensor. It is very similar to what we used in the current Reshape converter.\r\n- Added a check to see if a MatMul operation is actually a batch_matmul and then convert it appropriately. Also added tests for batch_matmul.\r\n-  Simplified opset v5 reshape by calling into infer_value_simulated.\r\n- Added opset v10 slice conversion and tests.\r\n- Added OneHot operation and tests.\r\n- Added ConstantOfShape operation and tests.\r\n- Removed ConstantFill operation as it has been deprecated for quite some time and replaced with the ConstantOfShape operation. The way we handled ConstantFill was not ideal since it was basically special-cased. Now that we have ConstantOfShape support it doesn't make sense to keep it around.\r\n- Added Unstack support to Split (Onnx uses Split for both regular split and unstack).\r\n- Added tile opset v6 and tests.\r\n- Added an opset override option to from_onnx. This is very useful for writing tests for different versions of an operator.\r\n\r\nAlthough I personally have confirmed these changes allow BERT to be imported and run, I haven't added it to the onnx frontend tests as it is very slow. If reviewers think its worth increasing test time for then I'd be happy to add it.\r\n\r\nNote that my implementation of ConstantOfShape does overlap with #4135 however there are some slight differences. For example I implement it using relay.full instead of relay.tile and \r\nI do not use a special case for it in the initial node parsing. If the reviewers prefer the other version of ConstantOfShape, I'd be happy to remove my implementation from this PR.","created_at":"2019-10-24T18:55:12Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:55:51Z","closed_at":"2019-10-30T18:24:47Z","merged_at":"2019-10-30T18:24:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"156aa5900ab04d9176cd333bb7d1ce10dce19faa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

Automatic quantization leads to in8xint8 conv. However, Intel machines needs uint8xint8 convolution to use VNNI instructions.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a legalization capability for Intel x86 machines. If the conv is int8xint8, this PR converts int8 input to uint8 by adding 128. And at the end, it subtracts an offset to account for that addition of 128.\r\n\r\nI tested this on cascade-lake machine for Resnet50v1.

people would like asserts to disappear when optimizing a graph, and we don't (yet) support an assert op (pending https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/3911 ), so this change is just translating a TF assert op to a no-op. Later on, it would be nice to give the option to preserve asserts and there is a todo in the code to this effect.\r\n\r\nThis requires support for no-ops, which is anyway needed since calling tf.assert() will actually yield a large sub-graph that contains, among other things, a tf.no_op op. What I wanted to do was to translate this as an empty tuple, but this has an error case if the op is the only op in a function, yielding a function that returns an empty tuple. Turns out that the runtime system doesn't handle that case for the ffi (I'm getting infinite recursion and other errors beyond that). So I'm converting it currently to a constant 0 scalar, which has no uses so it's dead code and therefore actually a correct no-op, except in the error case above where it's the only node in a function, which will now return an int instead of an empty tuple - that's the work-around. I'm open for suggestions on this. Seems to me that empty tuples should be supported, though not clear if that belongs in this change. There is a todo in the code to resolve this.","created_at":"2019-10-22T00:08:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T20:53:44Z","closed_at":"2019-10-23T20:53:04Z","merged_at":"2019-10-23T20:53:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"c147a31ddea3ba675b72185dd066e52e739b278d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

current implementation of vm `LoadConst` instruction attempts to call `CopyTo` method to allocate memory on device for each invocation. This is not problematic for execution on CPU as the constant pool always stores the allocated objects. However, this is very expensive when we perform inference on GPU as `CopyTo` needs to allocate device memory every time.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a runtime time constant pool to cache the allocated device memory and reuse it whenever possible. For example, the memory will be setup during warmup and inference will not allocate new device memory any more. It reduces the inference time of MXNet ResNet-50 V1 from 57ms to 16+ms on P2. \r\n\r\ncc @wweic @icemelon9 @jroesch @tqchen

PR has done the following:\r\n* Enable HWCN layout for conv2d in Relay.\r\n\r\nNow we can assign HWCN layout when creating a conv2d op using Relay:\r\n\r\n```\r\nout = relay.nn.conv2d(data, weight, ..., data_layout='HWCN', kernel_layout='HWIO')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAutoTVM can also extract the conv2d tasks with HWCN layout. It can be integrated into the layout conversion pass in the future.\r\n\r\n* Make the TOPI schedule of conv2d HWCN on CUDA tunable.\r\n\r\nThe tunable schedule is based on the original one and the original config is now the fallback, so it won't change the performance if users do not use AutoTVM. Here are the performance results on p3 of some conv2d workloads with different batch sizes. The scalability is defined as `(Throughput A / Throughput B) / (Batch Size A / Batch Size B)`, so 1 means prefer scale. Note that if the config space is less than 2,000 then we stopped after exploring the whole space. We can see from the results that the tuned schedule achieves on average 3.5x speedup and 0.98 scalability.\r\n\r\n\r\nN | C | H | W | O | KH | KW | Stride | Padding | Space | Default (GFLOP/s) |

 This PR removes the original node system, and make node as a subclass of Object.\r\n  This is a major refactor towards a better unified runtime object system, see RFC #4116 \r\n\r\n  List of changes in the refactor:\r\n    \r\n  - We now hide data_ field, use Downcast explicitly to get a sub-class object.\r\n  - Removed the node system FFI in python.\r\n  - Removed the node C API, instead use PackedFunc for list and get attrs.\r\n  - Change relay::Op::set_attr_type_key(attr_key_name) to relay::Op::set_attr_type<AttrType>().\r\n      - This change was necessary because of the new Object registration mechanism.\r\n      - Subsequent changes to the op registrations\r\n      - The change revealed a few previous problems that is now fixed.\r\n  - Patched up a few missing node type registration.\r\n      - Now we will raise an error if we register object that is not registered.\r\n  - The original node.h and container.h are kept in the same location.\r\n  - Calling convention: kObjectHandle now equals the old kNodeHandle, kNodeHandle is removed.\r\n  - IRFunctor now dispatches on ObjectRef.\r\n  - Update to the new type checking API: is_type, derived_from are replaced by IsInstance.\r\n  - Removed .hash member function, instead use C++ convention hasher

implements the first stage of an offline AutoTVM cache, somewhat like an offline TopHub. Auto-tuning can be performed in 'jobs' which are a series of sequentially tuned tasks. Data describing the platform on which the job was performed + when it took place can also be saved into the library.\r\n    \r\nThis is initial infrastructure to allow for more advanced management of the auto-tuning process. It includes a mechanism to skip tasks that are already tuned in the library.\r\n    \r\nFor further information, see the tutorial: 'tutorials/autotvm/tune_with_config_library.py'.\r\n\r\nRFC is here:

Runtime uses CPU Affinity by default.\r\nIt simply sets thread0 to use core0, thread1 to use core1, etc.\r\nLets say we have 8 cores box.\r\nUser runs two TVM instances and sets number of threads to be 4. \r\n`export TVM_NUM_THREADS=4`\r\nBoth TVM runtimes will use and share cores 0,1,2,3. Cores 4,5,6,7 will not be used.\r\nAs a result runtime performance will be 2 times slower.\r\nI think CPU Affinity should not be enables by default. Most of the users are not aware of CPU Affinity in TVM.\r\nIf we disable CPU Affinity before running the test above then OS maps TVM runtime threads to particular cores itself. As a result each TVM runtime will gets its own 4 cores and all 8 available cores on the box will be utilized.\r\nAs a result two TVM runtimes will run in parallel without stepping on each other.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables CPU Affinity by default.\r\nTo enable CPU Affinity user needs explicitly set `TVM_BIND_THREADS` to be `1`","created_at":"2019-10-18T01:13:28Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T16:35:03Z","closed_at":"2019-10-24T16:35:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb574b9f5c845a9e047b99287251beb3e4ce2c52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4145/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4145/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4145/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/99f2b75e76da8360c4df72d55b12eac5ff3cdaa7","head":{"label":"apivovarov:affinity","ref":"affinity","sha":"99f2b75e76da8360c4df72d55b12eac5ff3cdaa7","user":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147742342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDc3NDIzNDI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"apivovarov/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apivovarov","id":218087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODA4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov","html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apivovarov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apivovarov/tvm","description":"Open

autotvm, users can extract tuning tasks from models that are imported from relay.testing or other frameworks like tensorflow, however, current task extraction execution path contains unnecessary building of relay module into binary code. This PR is to optimize such an execution path and to save task extraction time.\r\n\r\nIt essentially exposes another interface from inside RelayBuildModule class, \"optimize\", that generates an optimized relay module (optimizing by FuseOps pass is essential). This output module can be fed to GraphRuntimeCodegen that goes through relay AST and detects corresponding tuning tasks while doing so. The new execution path eliminates the unnecessary tvm::build call, which takes a lot of time, without affecting the original task extraction goal.\r\n\r\nExperiments of extracting tuning tasks from relay.testing models:\r\n\r\nmodel | before(s) | after(s) | speedup\r\n--- | --- | --- | ---\r\nresnet-18 | 137.04 | 15.61 | 8.78x\r\nresnet-34 | 137.11 | 15.74 | 8.71x\r\nresnet-50 | 250.77 | 21.88 |

PR is to change the default rounding from TONEAREST to UPWARD. QNN ops are converted to a sequence of Relay operator while compilation. TONEAREST rounding leads to many more relay operators as shown here \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/11a3a777ec78ad81ce12a940d07521870f546ad1/src/relay/qnn/util.cc#L113-L124\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a case for the **default** rounding option to be UPWARD.\r\n\r\nI ran all [TFLite hosted Inception Quantized models](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/hosted_models#quantized_models) on a Cascade Lake machine with these two rounding options. I am giving the comparison numbers that show that UPWARD rounding is overall better alternative.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n### Accuracy Comparison\r\nAccuracy is same regardless of the rounding choice. Tested over 50k images with pre-processing.\r\n\r\nModel | Upward | Tonearest\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nInception V1 | 69.592/89.456 | 69.592/89.456\r\nInception V2 | 73.332/91.328 | 73.332/91.328\r\nInception V3 | 77.306/93.618 | 77.306/93.618\r\nInception V4 | 79.55/94.196 | 79.55/94.196\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Latency Comparison\r\nBecause TONEAREST leads to many more operators, the observed latency is higher.\r\n\r\nModel | Upward (ms) | Tonearest (ms)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nInception V1 | 2.13497 | 2.97504\r\nInception V2 | 8.96444 | 11.89356\r\nInception V3 | 6.11635 | 9.13942\r\nInception V4 | 12.24914 | 16.80568\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compilation Time Comparison\r\nToNearest has very high compilation time. Though not included, it blows up drastically for mobilenet V1.\r\n\r\nModel | Upward (seconds) | Tonearest (seconds)\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nInception V1 | 80 | 113\r\nInception V2 | 53 | 55\r\nInception V3 | 67 | 80\r\nInception V4 | 64 | 75\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n### Memory Footprint\r\n\r\nThough I don't have numbers for that yet. @shoubhik also pointed out that memory footprint for the params increased with TONEAREST. This is mostly because TONEAREST introduces some more constants in the network, and they are in `int64`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nBackground about QNN rounding choices\r\nhttps://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/11a3a777ec78ad81ce12a940d07521870f546ad1/include/tvm/relay/qnn/attrs.h#L52-L61\r\n\r\n**The point is that TONEAREST and UPWARD differ at only negative mid values (like -1.5, -2.5 and so on). This difference is invisible in end-to-end accuracy.**\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n### What does other frameworks do?\r\nEvery toolchain has their own favorite rounding choice. There is no widely chosen in-production standard AFAIK.\r\n\r\n* TFLite - Chooses ARM based rounding. It works back from ARM assembly instructions, and very close to TONEAREST, but not exactly TONEAREST.\r\n* MKLDNN - RoundNearestEven as per MKLDNN doc. This is not TONEAREST rounding.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote that this PR is only changing the default value, one can still choose any rounding option if one wants. This is for TVM user, who does not want to worry about different roundings.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @jackwish @vinx13 @FrozenGene @u99127 @zhiics @yzhliu

PR introduces a new object protocol to unify the node and object.\r\nWe also updated the existing runtime::vm code to make use of the new system.\r\n\r\nUpdate to the node will be done in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n- Remove object-related code in json serializer as that code logic was not complete\r\n  and we have a separate serializer for VM, can revisit later. \r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\n\r\n- Object: the container class, like Node\r\n- ObjectPtr: the intrusive pointer\r\n- ObjectRef: the reference class\r\n\r\n## Improvement over Node and old Object System\r\n\r\n- Support both static and dynamic type_index(tag)\r\n- Optimize IsInstance check when class have final attribute\r\n- Make use of static type index range for sub-class checking if

It looks like that there are two translation units registering `module._Enabled` respectively in the same registry, and `override=False` leads to error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  what():  [05:35:49] /home/ubuntu/unison/mxnet4/gpu/3rdparty/tvm/src/runtime/registry.cc:79: Check failed: override: Global PackedFunc module._Enabled is already registered\r\nStack trace:\r\n  [bt] (0) /home/ubuntu/unison/mxnet4/gpu/3rdparty/tvm/build/libtvm.so(tvm::runtime::Registry::Register(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, bool)+0x47b) [0x7f1a00dfe3db]\r\n```\r\nThe MXNet PR that can be used to reproduce the problem: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16414. In my case, it only happens when built with CUDA enabled. Pure CPU build is fine.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @yzhliu

2.0 is now the stable release and breaks a few operations (different names, attributes, namespaces, etc). TF 1.x still evolves a little bit (1.15 coming), and the user community is likely to expect 1.x to still be supported.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the TF tutorial, as well as the TF frontend to Relay, so as to address #4101 . It is also the first part in supporting TF2.x completely.\r\n\r\nNote for CR:\r\n* Individual commits contain errors and wrong contents, fixed in the end result. I hope we can squash the whole thing at merge time to hide my hesitation and early misunderstanding of the code base.\r\n* There is no new test. I do not see test coverage on the kind of change made here (basically in `tests/python/frontend/tensorflow/test_forward.py` around line 1103), so I guess it is more valuable for the community to get a fixed tutorial sooner. I am looking at how to test such change effectively, though, so may push something before the CR is completed (or require to complete).\r\n* For some reason the [linter](https://docs.tvm.ai/contribute/pull_request.html) does not work for me. I am trying different container versions, but no avail on Darwin for now.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe following is the original contents for this PR, but way too broad. The target to support TF2.0 is tracked with issue #4102 \r\n\r\n*This PR is WIP (read \"not working yet\"), as suggested by @srkreddy1238 to get started with TF 2 support*\r\n\r\nTF 2.0 is now the stable release and breaks a few operations (different names, attributes, namespaces, etc). TF 1.x still evolves a little bit (1.15 coming), and the user community is likely to expect 1.x to still be supported.\r\n\r\nHere is a *very early* attempt at supporting TF 2.0, still compatible with TF 1.x, based on a first target: Get the TF tutorial back on track. There will be more to do.\r\n\r\n- [x] Get the tutorial to run with TF 2.0.\r\n- [] Support operations at the intersection of TF 2.0 and TVM 0.6 (i.e. no new operation from TF yet).\r\n- [] Add test coverage against new APIs that have to be supported (e.g. `resize` has a new attribute, and no choice but to add it).","created_at":"2019-10-11T08:45:16Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T23:52:36Z","closed_at":"2019-11-12T23:52:25Z","merged_at":"2019-11-12T23:52:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"e541c75863775f9011a658a36b86f084133bfbb7","assignee":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

`VirtualMachine` object currently contains both bytecode related information (e.g. constant pool, primitive names, etc) and VM specific data (e.g. pc, ip etc) which looks very heavy. It also makes serialization and deserialization work at the VM level although many of the VM internal data are not needed.\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts the bytecode and library related data out of the virtual machine and creates a separate vm Executable structure to hold such information. Therefore, VM becomes a thin runtime that operates on the executable. The VM compiler, serializer, and deserializer therefore only need to work on the Executable as well. For example, VM compiler compiles a Relay program and produces an Executable instead of a Virtual Machine which contains many uninitialized states.
