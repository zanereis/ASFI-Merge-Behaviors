change wants to support detect non-bijective iteration sum like `h + kh` or `4 * i + j, j in [0, 6)` etc. Previously they would not pass `DetectIterMap` either in bijective or surjective mode.\r\n\r\nIIUC, one of the `DetectIterMap`'s main concentration is on iteration bindings which can perfectly split/fuse from loop index vars, however, there are also a wider range of applications on memory access indices analysis and non-perfect tilings. Thus it would be great that certain index patterns could also get supported. For example,\r\n- `h + kh`:  an index pattern common in stride=1 convolution or poolings.\r\n-  `4 * co + ci`, `ci`'s extent is larger than `co`'s scale:  typically occurs in overlapped input tiles.\r\n\r\nCurrently they are not supported in `TryFuseIters` routine of `DetectIterMap`, since scales are strictly checked here. If we have `4 * co + ci`, the `ci`'s extent must be 4 to match next iter(`co`)'s scale. The PR try to relax it in surjective mode.\r\n\r\nFor example, the iteration sequence of `4 * co + ci` (`co` in [0, 3), `ci` in [0, 5)) could be:\r\n\r\n `0, 1, 2, 3, 4;   4, 5, 6, 7, 8;   8, 9, 10, 11, 12`\r\n\r\nThus it is \"surjective\" on range [0, 3 * 4 + 1) = [0, 13).\r\n\r\nFor the existing cases, the effects seems to be:\r\n1. Some cases which expect failure now pass, mainly because block's affine flag depends on the surjective-ness check.\r\n2. The split primitive testcases create many `i + j` patterns, they now get handled differently, which affects expected block binding expression.\r\n3. Due to (2), two of the basic meta-schedule case's expected block binding expression also changed.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-08T09:20:16Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T23:38:42Z","closed_at":"2022-07-19T14:45:11Z","merged_at":"2022-07-19T14:45:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e7a2ad9568a79fb775c0ca9d09a3fa2f51f792f","assignee":{"login":"spectrometerHBH","id":32121147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32121147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH","html_url":"https://github.com/spectrometerHBH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"spectrometerHBH","id":32121147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTIxMTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32121147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH","html_url":"https://github.com/spectrometerHBH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectrometerHBH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/52ea3ca731b4b0c5d86a5f5c44e49baeb098f743","head":{"label":"wrongtest-intellif:support_overlapped_itersum","ref":"support_overlapped_itersum","sha":"52ea3ca731b4b0c5d86a5f5c44e49baeb098f743","user":{"login":"wrongtest-intellif","id":7600935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/wrongtest-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270636227,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA2MzYyMjc=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"wrongtest-intellif/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wrongtest-intellif","id":7600935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7600935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif","html_url":"https://github.com/wrongtest-intellif","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrongtest-intellif/repos","even

added.","created_at":"2022-07-07T21:42:55Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T17:25:56Z","closed_at":"2022-07-08T17:25:56Z","merged_at":"2022-07-08T17:25:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"684a8381608f0978ea91539af7c9d3c2f6e85eaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12035/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12035/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12035/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fca726cb5e681d32f119237073bc42d655248410","head":{"label":"zxybazh:bugfix/2022-07-06/fix-datatype-issue","ref":"bugfix/2022-07-06/fix-datatype-issue","sha":"fca726cb5e681d32f119237073bc42d655248410","user":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":337237632,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzcyMzc2MzI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"zxybazh/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxybazh","id":3203174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDMxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh","html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxybazh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxybazh/tvm","description":"Open

the `ci.py` script would execute all C++ unit tests in the `\"build\"` directory, regardless of the docker image being used.  This change allows a caller to specify the build directory to be used by `task_cpp_unittest.sh`, either by the command line or by using the same `TVM_BUILD_PATH environment variable as used by the top-level Makefile, and passes this argument from `ci.py`.  To preserve the existing behavior for the pre-commit CI, if no argument is passed and if the `TVM_BUILD_PATH` is undefined, `task_cpp_unittest.sh` defaults to the `\"build\"` directory.\r\n\r\nPython unit tests executed through `ci.py` used the `TVM_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, and were not similarly affected.\n\ncc @Mousius @areusch

This line https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12007/commits/7805d6fb113c9a68dd4628bb136416349f211ca2#diff-c3bb97b7e813244d6dae39925cc10bb9d50e8b7a280556b423068b3705f9f114R363 fixes it.\r\n\r\nIn short, there should be no layout rewriting here since no conv etc. are used. But when the pass is checking resize1d, the previous code do not pass consistent layouts for the argument `old_in_layouts` for the two calls of `ResizeInferCorrectLayout` (the first time NCH from `old_in`https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ef08c36294dc7c90f9d4536948507eca515012bd/src/relay/transforms/transform_layout.h#L341, second time NCW from `old_in_2`https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/ef08c36294dc7c90f9d4536948507eca515012bd/src/relay/transforms/transform_layout.h#L363), misleading the optimizer into thinking that the layout has changed and hence an ill-formed layout_transform is inserted.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the naming based on suggestions from @masahi in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10118, as well as adds several comments and logging statements to help people understand. (Hope this helps you understand that change better too @masahi

strategy.)\r\n\r\nCollage uses a small 'combinator library' of PartitionRule to decribe how candidate partitions can be extracted from a model for measurement and comparison. This introduces most of that machinery, however we defer the all important 'CombinerPartitionRule' for the next PR. Thus the rules at this stage can only express the sorts of DFPattern-based rules we find in most BYOC integrations, and cannot describe rules more traditionally associated with operator fusion.","created_at":"2022-07-01T21:21:13Z","updated_at":"2022-07-12T17:37:01Z","closed_at":"2022-07-12T16:46:33Z","merged_at":"2022-07-12T16:46:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1706a933e93737f66e6589941f878e922d38197","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/06446ce30c1546b17c729d9853863a71711c34cf","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-collage-partition-rule","ref":"mbs-collage-partition-rule","sha":"06446ce30c1546b17c729d9853863a71711c34cf","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

This does for the TensorRT integration what #11631 did for the CUTLASS integration. See https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/byoc-how-backwards-compatible-does-the-tensorrt-partition-for-tensorrt-function-need-to-be/12957 for discussion.\r\n\r\n- All compilation options are captured within the attributes of a Target of   kind \"tensorrt\" (instead of the \"relay.ext.tensorrt.options\" attribute in PassContext). This means all BYOC configurations options needed by Collage can be captured uniformly by a list-of-Targets. It also means RPC boundaries (as used internally at OctoML) only need to worry about maintaining the fidelity of the Target instance(s) rather than reaching into the PassContex.\r\n\r\n   The API is now:\r\n   ```\r\n     host_target = tvm.target.Target(\"llvm\")\r\n     cuda_target = tvm.target.Target(\"cuda\", host=host_target) \r\n     trt_target = tvm.target.Target(\"tensorrt -use_fp16=True\", host=host_target)\r\n     mod = tensorrt.partition_for_tensorrt(mod, params=params, target=trt_target)\r\n     runtime_mod = build(mod, target=[cuda_target, trt_target])\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n- Compilation is switched from function-at-a-time (relying on the TECompiler) to IRModule-at-a-time (using the RelayToTIR target-specific hook mechanism). Though not strictly necessary for Collage I want to check the path is now clear to   deprecate the support for BYOC in TEComplier.\r\n- Get all the TensorRT tests going again, except for a few I've disabled with x-link to a new issue #11765. CAUTION: The TensorRT runtime is not supported in CI so many of these tests are just cosmetic. \r\n- While trying to track down a 'free(): invalid pointer' error in test_tensorrt_int8_exp.py made the TensorRT allocs/frees more robust, but turns out it unrelated issue #9362 (thanks Masa). No harm leaving these changes in though.","created_at":"2022-06-30T22:17:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-01T22:56:39Z","closed_at":"2022-07-01T22:09:07Z","merged_at":"2022-07-01T22:09:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2a14a6880ee2e4520f3e9a55accb258e8725e65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11979/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11979/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11979/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c8e10c96d94d66dd8faace8546822dd8a4768bda","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-collage-trt-refresh","ref":"mbs-collage-trt-refresh","sha":"c8e10c96d94d66dd8faace8546822dd8a4768bda","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

a compilation unit includes `<tvm/ir/expr.h>`, but does not include `<tvm/tir/op.h>`, the operator overloads for `ObjectRef` are declared, but the operator overloads for `PrimExpr` are not.  In this case, any use of `expr_a == expr_b` would use `ObjectRef`'s implementation and compare reference equality of the two expressions, rather than returning a `PrimExpr` that represents the comparison.  By having the operator overloads in the `<tvm/ir/expr.h>` header file, directly adjacent to the `PrimExpr` declaration, the correct overload must be available whenever the `PrimExpr` can be used.\r\n\r\nEven though this would only impact `operator==`, `operator!=`, and `operator<`, the three operators defined for `ObjectRef`, this PR moves all operator overloads to `expr.h` for consistency.\r\n\r\nThe named version of the operators (e.g. `tvm::add`) do not have overloaded variants, and so they are intentionally kept in `<tvm/tir/op.h>`.","created_at":"2022-06-30T19:47:31Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T15:11:39Z","closed_at":"2022-07-18T16:03:55Z","merged_at":"2022-07-18T16:03:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c7aaace4355c67403be563de3059d34fb8e29f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR factors extracts functionality of `BufferDomainTouched` out into `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer` and `IntSetAnalyzer`.  It is broken up into the following sequence of changes, each in a separate commit for ease of review.\r\n\r\n- Allow binding of `Var` in `IntSetAnalyzer`, similar to the other four subanalyzers in `arith::Analyzer`.\r\n- Updated `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer` to mimic `IRMutatorWithAnalyzer`, to allow subclassing when implementing other visitors.\r\n- Moved `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer` to `tvm::arith` namespace.  This is in keeping with its location in `src/arith` directory, and further mimics `IRMutatorWithAnalyzer`\r\n- Updated `BufferDomainTouched` to use `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer`.  This used the earlier changes to allow subclasses of `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer`, and to expose binding/constraints to `IntSetAnalyzer`.\r\n\r\nAll tests of `BufferDomainTouched` in `test_arith_domain_touched.py` and all tests of `DomainTouchedAccessMap` in `test_tir_te_extern_primfunc.py` are all passing
