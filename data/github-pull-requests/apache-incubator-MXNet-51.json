for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nExtend existing Java code to support Module for general inference\r\n@andrewfayres @nswamy @yzhliu\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-10-16T04:02:03Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:08:54Z","closed_at":"2018-11-12T21:56:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97805908a417b7c4df67a6134649233064d3be03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher-order gradient of sin,cos,negative,mul, tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Need to support more

Description ##\r\ndd a single test that scans all registered operators and checks for a registered FGradient. This will help with the developing support for higher order gradients. Currently the test fails because many of the operators do not have an FGradient. \r\n\r\npart of #10002 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items

Description ##\r\nThis is a PR to add a index_copy() tensor operator, which will be used in the DGL project.\r\n\r\n`output = mx.nd.contrib.index_copy(old_tensor, index, new_tensor)`\r\n\r\nThis op copies the elements of a `new_tensor` into the `old_tensor` by \r\nselecting the indices in the order given in `index`. The output will be a new tensor \r\ncontains the rest elements of old tensor and the copied elements of new tensor. \r\nFor example, if `index[i] == j`, then the `i`th row of `new_tensor` is copied to the \r\n`j`th row of output.\r\n\r\nThe `index` must be a vector and it must have the same size with the `0`th dimimention of \r\n`new_tensor`. Also, the `0`th dimimention of old_tensor must `>=` the `0`th dimimention of \r\n`new_tensor`, or an error will be raised.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nx = mx.nd.zeros((5,3))\r\nt = mx.nd.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\r\nindex = mx.nd.array([0,4,2])\r\n\r\nmx.nd.contrib.index_copy(x, index, t)\r\n\r\n[[1. 2. 3.]\r\n [0. 0. 0.]\r\n [7. 8. 9.]\r\n [0. 0. 0.]\r\n [4. 5. 6.]]\r\n<NDArray 5x3 @cpu(0)>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add index_copy-inl.h, index_copy.cc, and index_copy.cu for index_copy operator.\r\n- [x] Add test_index_copy() in Python

is a PR to add a index_copy() tensor operator, which will be used in the DGL project.\r\n\r\n`output = mx.nd.contrib.index_copy(old_tensor, index, new_tensor)`\r\n\r\nThis op copies the elements of a `new_tensor` into the `old_tensor` by \r\nselecting the indices in the order given in `index`. The output will be a new tensor \r\ncontains the rest elements of old tensor and the copied elements of new tensor. \r\nFor example, if `index[i] == j`, then the `i`th row of `new_tensor` is copied to the \r\n`j`th row of output.\r\n\r\nThe `index` must be a vector and it must have the same size with the `0`th dimimention of \r\n`new_tensor`. Also, the `0`th dimimention of old_tensor must `>=` the `0`th dimimention of \r\n`new_tensor`, or an error will be raised.\r\n\r\nExamples::\r\n\r\nx = mx.nd.zeros((5,3))\r\nt = mx.nd.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\r\nindex = mx.nd.array([0,4,2])\r\n\r\nmx.nd.contrib.index_copy(x, index, t)\r\n\r\n[[1. 2. 3.]\r\n [0. 0. 0.]\r\n [7. 8. 9.]\r\n [0. 0. 0.]\r\n [4. 5. 6.]]\r\n<NDArray 5x3 @cpu(0)>\r\n\r\nNote that, so far we don't need the backward function for this operator.","created_at":"2018-10-12T13:14:51Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T13:21:30Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T13:21:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ac8084dd8be85521c3f00ea7b71259d975c9d1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b3bbd4bd57b0755af44b80375cd74d24c72e44da","head":{"label":"aksnzhy:master","ref":"master","sha":"b3bbd4bd57b0755af44b80375cd74d24c72e44da","user":{"login":"aksnzhy","id":22660103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjYwMTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22660103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy","html_url":"https://github.com/aksnzhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aksnzhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"06bf600a7547463b5d390974e4f7fdcf3f968e4c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis is a PR to add MKL-DNN Quantization Examples and README based on subgraph feature. #12530 \r\n@zheng-da, @azai91, @reminisce, @TaoLv, @pengzhao-intel\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Improve image-classification quantization script to support more models converted from Gluon-CV.\r\n- [x] Improve init_param function to support min, max node in quantized graph. Test case has been added and passed.\r\n- [x] Improve image-classification inference script to support dummy data inference.\r\n- [x] Improve SSD evaluate script to support specific num_batch and dry run.\r\n- [x] Add quantization script for SSD-VGG16 and improve its benchmark script to support quantized SSD.\r\n- [x] Add quantization README in which take ResNet50-v1, SSD-VGG16 and Squeezenet1.0 as examples and give brief introduction to quantize a custom symbol.\r\n- [x] Add subgraph instruction in MKLDNN_README and Performance page.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Performance will be show

Description ##\r\n* fixes issue - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12795\r\n* Problem: If we have multiple inputs passed to the same block, then output symbol will have same name leading to conflicts. \r\n* Solution: append input symbol name to the block prefix, making output names to be unique per input symbol.\r\n\r\nExample code of having 2 inputs to same block. The same Dense block is applied twice (2 inputs). Without this change, both a and b will have same name.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyBlock(mx.gluon.HybridBlock):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        with

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the MXNet's use of cudnnFind() to address a few issues:\r\n    1. With the gluon imperative style, cudnnFind() is called during forward(), and so might have its timings perturbed by other GPU activity (including potentially other cudnnFind() calls).\r\n    2. With some cuda drivers versions, care is needed to ensure that the large I/O and workspace cudaMallocs() performed by cudnnFind() are immediately released and available to MXNet.\r\n    3. cudnnFind() makes both conv I/O and workspace allocations that must be covered by the GPU global memory headroom defined by MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_RESERVE.  Per issue #12662, large convolutions can result in out-of-memory errors, even when MXNet's storage allocator has free memory in its pool.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these issues, providing the following benefits:\r\n    1. Consistent algo choice for a given convolution type in a model, both for instances in the same GPU and in other GPUs in a multi-GPU training setting.\r\n    2. Consistent algo choice from run to run, based on eliminating sources of interference of the cudnnFind() timing process.\r\n    3. Consistent model global memory footprint, both because of the consistent algo choice (algo's can have markedly different workspace requirements) and changes to MXNet's use of cudaMalloc.\r\n    4. Increased training performance based on being able to consistently run with models that approach the GPU's full global memory footprint.\r\n    5.  Adds a unittest for and solves issue #12662.\r\n\r\nNow specifically, the PR makes the following changes/additions:\r\n    1. Merges the cudnn algo registry separate Find() and Register() methods into a single FindOrElseRegister() call protected by a mutex.  Before, there was a window of time between when a thread found no algo entry and when it registered a new entry.  This window could allow a different thread to call cudnnFind() on the same convolution type, getting a different answer.  FindOrElseRegister() takes a callback that determines the algo via cudnnFind() and makes access to the cudnn algo registry effectively atomic.  The callbacks provided with cudnn_convolution and cudnn_deconvolution also grab the storage allocator's mutex to quiet the GPU activity from other threads during the running of cudnnFind().\r\n    2. Changes MXNet's storage allocator to round large allocations to a multiple of 2MB.  This value ensures that small permanent allocations that might have shared a cuda memory allocation slab with a prior large allocation don't prevent the reclaiming of that slab area.\r\n    3. Includes use of the MXNet storage allocator's Alloc() and DirectFree() API to coax a convolution's I/O storage needs away from MXNet's storage allocator prior to calling cudnnFind().\r\n\r\nThe first commit introduces a unittest that demonstrates issue #12662 in the current codebase.  In order to make the test adaptable to GPUs of varying global memory, a C-level API was brought out to the python API by introducing mx.context.gpu_memory_info(dev_id).  Follow-up commits supply the fix and the rest of the PR. \r\n\r\nHopefully Interested parties: @KellenSunderland @piiswrong @eric-haibin-lin @zheng-da\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\nThe following command was run on an 8-GPU system to demonstrate the new consistency of global memory footprint:\r\n```\r\npython /opt/mxnet/example/image-classification/train_imagenet.py --gpu 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 --batch-size 256 --num-epochs 1 --data-train /data/iman-val-recordio-352/train.rec --disp-batches 10 --network inception-v3 --data-nthreads 32 --image-shape 3,299,299\r\n```\r\nTwo nvidia-smi outputs are shown.  The first is before the PR (showing footprints in the range of 5GB to 8GB), while the second is after (showing consistent 5GB footprints with < 1% variation).\r\n\r\nBefore PR:\r\n```\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| NVIDIA-SMI 410.45                 Driver Version: 410.45                    |\r\n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Description ##\r\nContinues https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12446. Fixes fixes the flaky topk test reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12358 , https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12310. The \"misalignment error\" was triggered because we had not aligned the pointers.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] fix topk, tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- We need to add a helper function for allocating temp-storage with multiple dtypes + shapes.\r\n- We should pay attention to the memory alignment in the future.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-11T16:13:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T17:38:31Z","closed_at":"2018-10-18T17:38:31Z","merged_at":"2018-10-18T17:38:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ebbf944ff8bfbf66b214910d32f1b4cdd1d190d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis fixes #12783, by assigning *all* nodes in `hybrid_forward` a unique `name`. Some operations were in fact performed without attaching the appropriate (time) prefix to the name, which makes serialized graphs non-deserializable.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Fixed `hybrid_forward` of `mxnet.gluon.rnn.RNNCell` to account for time prefix\r\n- [ ] Fixed `hybrid_forward` of `mxnet.gluon.rnn.LSTMCell` to account for time prefix\r\n- [ ] Fixed `hybrid_forward` of `mxnet.gluon.rnn.GRUCell` to account for time prefix\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTests have not been added to verify the correctness of the fixed `hybrid_forward`, as already existing tests should suffice.\r\n\r\nHowever, from this issue it appears that proper serialization/deserialization tests are missing for `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`,

Description ##\r\nFixes #8850.\r\n\r\nRecent updates introduced new functions whose declarations were expanded by the amalgamation script, but left out the definition because the expansion list did not include all necessary header files.\r\n\r\nThe fix for now is to \r\n- deal with ambiguous `complex.h`.\r\n- include the missing header files in the expansion list.\r\n\r\nso that amalgamation can be compiled without errors.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this

Description ##\r\nOn using the example script “example\\gluon\\dcgan.py”,  it is noticed the loss and metrics of netG and netD are not straight-forward to evaluate the quality of the generated images. (the absolute value of the metrics/loss fluctuate outstandingly, and there is no stable trends can be observed).\r\n\r\nAccording to the paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) and a tensorflow implementation [openai/improved-gan](https://github.com/openai/improved-gan) “inception score” is a methedodoly to evaluate the image quality generate by DCGAN. Via this PR, I implemented the inception score for DCGAN by using the pre-trained CNN model provided by gluon model zoo. The test result is expected.\r\n\r\nreference to #12612 \r\n@pengzhao-intel @juliusshufan\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add inception_score.py as inception_score calculation module\r\n- [x] Modify dcgan.py to make it easy to call each functions, including the inception_score function\r\n- [x] Add the results(generated pics and inception_score curve chart)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-11T01:22:32Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T01:03:13Z","closed_at":"2018-10-21T18:39:19Z","merged_at":"2018-10-21T18:39:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"013748300a1182f30d80442c7f3b3164b49af25a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":718413113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg0MTMxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Example","name":"Example","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n* Fix 1st part of the issue - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12713 \r\n* In dist mode, update_on_kvstore was getting overridden based on async/sparse weight, grad only. In this fix we handle - \"dist_device_sync\" and not ignoring kvstore_params i.e, kvstore_params['update_on_kvstore'] value.\r\n* Add test case for the same.\r\n* Credits @eric-haibin-lin - https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet/commit/856b5034e57633d888fcc1e3d82b8703945511ce\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Fix update_on_kvstore flag setting bug in Gluon trainer in dist mode.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Test cases are passing.\r\n- [TODO] Run segmentation example in distributed mode to verify the fix in real-world case.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\nThis PR aims to add more CNN models to benchmark scripts like squeezenet and mobilenet and make it more user-friendly. Also add a CNN benchmark script for gluon.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add 'inception-v4', 'inception-resnet-v2', 'mobilenet', 'densenet121', 'squeezenet1.1' to benchmark_score.py\r\n- [x] Add '--network' to script for specific and run all models by default to keep same with before.\r\n- [x] Add '--batch-size' to script for specific and run [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32] by default to keep same with before.\r\n- [x] Add script for gluon to benchmark more CNN models.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- 'densenet121', 'squeezenet1.1' in benchmark_score are converted from gluon in order to cover more cases.\r\n- These models are benefit a lot from #12530\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @juliusshufan

Please merge the previous one first and then this one.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, Java NDArray were introduced as well as a brand new Builder Operators. Deprecated operators were removed from Java API Macros. Please see the unit test for more information.\r\n@andrewfayres  @nswamy @yzhliu @gigasquid \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks for @zachgk @piyushghai for guidance and support on Java new API!\r\n\r\n## Checklist

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nAdds the Java friendly version of some of the core classes that will be used for the Java Inference API. Also adds very basic unit tests for them. The purpose of which is to test that the wrapper is actually callable from Java. Testing of the Scala implementation of the wrapped class is left to the Scala testing.\r\n\r\nAlso increased the max limit on line length in our styletest config. The existing 100 limit is very easy to hit (our own style config file actually goes over this but it doesn't check itself).\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-08T15:36:20Z","updated_at":"2018-10-09T21:30:00Z","closed_at":"2018-10-09T21:28:34Z","merged_at":"2018-10-09T21:28:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcbac41bce5c183186482aa7ae3d2675c28e2737","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nMKLDNN by default caches mkldnn memory and primitives to performance reasons. The cache looks uses input shape as a key. However, when models accept variable size inputs, the cache constantly grows and is not cleared. A flag is added MXNET_MKLDNN_CACHE_ENABLED that will disable this.\r\n\r\nIn a future PR, we can clear the cache automatically if it growths a certain length.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Add flag (MXNET_MKLDNN_CACHE_ENABLED) to disable cache.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-05T22:32:54Z","updated_at":"2018-11-22T19:50:45Z","closed_at":"2018-11-22T19:50:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db3f65f1d7eef07f7f896cd3b6da6a7451749b7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12019 fallback was implemented to support non MKLDNN operators. A tag was added to each MKLDNN operator to check if it needed to be converted. A flag was not added to all operators which caused a regression.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] add TIsMKLDNN to flatten and elementwise_add\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-04T23:08:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T01:16:40Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T01:16:40Z","merged_at":"2018-10-10T01:16:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddddede24ee558a8b1f69713ad195cd7d37665c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-04T17:02:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-21T04:03:06Z","closed_at":"2018-10-21T04:03:06Z","merged_at":"2018-10-21T04:03:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"d8c73755be8d6e8257db2cd3ff62aed019cfca96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdding DepthToSpace, SpaceToDepth operators to ONNX import/export\r\n\r\nv2: Added tests for SpaceToDepth. \r\nv3: Updated the test for SpaceToDepth - removed hard coded input/output. Since ONNX export test executed import, export, import, maintaining the custom test only in mxnet_export_test.py.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added DepthToSpace, SpaceToDepth operator import/export\r\n- Added

PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nmxnet-mkldnn on mac requires that openmp be enabled (else performance is degraded). There are currently instructions specifying that the Makefile needs to be modified to address this; however, that is not a good user experience. \r\n\r\nthe issue is that mac by default does not include openmp by default and therefore a guard was added to prevent users from trying to build with this. the developer should instead not build with openmp enabled on mac and the Makefile should not attempt to catch this (the user may falsely believe they are using openmp when they are not).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Update MKLDNN readme docs\r\n- [x] remove guard that prevents openmp from being enabled on mac\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-02T19:10:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T16:30:40Z","closed_at":"2018-10-16T16:30:40Z","merged_at":"2018-10-16T16:30:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"5961dce0f790a0002de37b4cc19d8167cbaedc82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR is an extension of this PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12721\r\nPlease merge the previous one first and then this one\r\nadding two examples: `charRNN` and `Object detector`.\r\n@piyushghai @andrewfayres @nswamy @yzhliu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-02T18:46:29Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:08:56Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T16:34:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8b8eabbceffa5e16ff6bba9158ba8ac64b94935","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdded a base wrapper class to benchmark Scala Inference examples. The class runs single inference and batch inference calls and emits the the inference time taken in easy to consume metrics :  p50, p99 and average. \r\n\r\nThere is also an attached README indicating the usage, as well as an example ```ImageClassifierExample``` using Resnet-152 to show how the tool can be used. \r\nA simple run of the benchmark class with the provided ```run_image_inference_bm.sh``` produces the following sample output when run locally on a MacBook Pro : \r\n\r\n```\r\n[main] INFO org.apache.mxnetexamples.benchmark.CLIParserBase - \r\nsingle_inference_p99 1663, single_inference_p50 729, single_inference_average 755.170000\r\n...        \r\nINFO org.apache.mxnetexamples.benchmark.CLIParserBase - \r\nbatch_inference_p99 4241, batch_inference_p50 4241, batch_inference_average 4241.000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore examples around this tool are under development and will be contributed soon by @lanking520 ( Thanks for helping out on this! ) \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-10-02T18:22:58Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T20:03:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-05T20:03:12Z","merged_at":"2018-10-05T20:03:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"e93af41a6f02e902b94576f7efda47f380ce9919","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ca55904d3f39d261702812b39b0f89c35a1e4ee3","head":{"label":"piyushghai:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca55904d3f39d261702812b39b0f89c35a1e4ee3","user":{"login":"piyushghai","id":7931019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzEwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7931019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai","html_url":"https://github.com/piyushghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138212977,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzgyMTI5Nzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"piyushghai/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"piyushghai","id":7931019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzEwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7931019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai","html_url":"https://github.com/piyushghai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piyushghai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/piyushghai/incubator

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12645 changed the default of linking dynamically agains gpertfools and jemalloc to static linking. This breaks the build on machines where jemalloc is available for static linking, but incompatible with the mxnet library due to missing position-independent code (-fPIC) support.

setting is used for python egg or wheel files to indicate what packages are required during the installation.\r\nDefault numpy version on ubuntu 18 is 1.15.2.

Description ##\r\nSpeed up travis builds to avoid timeouts.  This PR removes some redundant build tasks and removes some slow tests  to try and decrease the number of TravisCI timeouts that would otherwise  occur on large PRs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this
