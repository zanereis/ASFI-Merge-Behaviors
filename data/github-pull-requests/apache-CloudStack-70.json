PR contains the refactor of the LibvirtComputingResource. The motivation behind this effort is to increase maintainability and testability of the code.\n\nThe LibvirtComputingResource went from 5.5k to 3.3k lines of code. The unit tests went from 300 to 5050 lines of code, covering 23.3% of the whole KVM plugin (instead of the previous 4%).\n\nAll the code extracted from the LibvirtComputingResource has 64.8% coverage.\n\nThis has already been rebased and built. I'm creating the PR now but will test it against a KVM hypervisor before it gets pushed towards the Master branch.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","created_at":"2015-05-06T17:42:21Z","updated_at":"2015-05-18T07:55:23Z","closed_at":"2015-05-13T09:35:55Z","merged_at":"2015-05-13T09:35:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"7af39ee6e65a346ef2c4d407e1e2f4f3cbad724c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/f575206ad4348fb7fc0fe312a1e797bac23d011b","head":{"label":"schubergphilis:refactor/libvirt_resource","ref":"refactor/libvirt_resource","sha":"f575206ad4348fb7fc0fe312a1e797bac23d011b","user":{"login":"schubergphilis","id":864482,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg2NDQ4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/864482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis","html_url":"https://github.com/schubergphilis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5af7c352aa7b2fe35eb3fc59b23df85fe1a18501","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

PR #211 introduced changes where the abstract investigator testIpAddress()\nwould return other Status, which previously only returned null, Up or Down. In\nthis patch we introduce a new Status \"Unknown\" that replaces null's semantics.\n\nThe important changes #211 introduced was the debugging statements as semantically\nthe changes would work same as the consumers of testIpAddress() method only used\nif returned values were Up or Down and in other cases (null, Alert etc) it would\nsimply continue to loop through the resources being

a full cluster is down or unreachable,\nCloudStack currently reports everything the\nsame as the last known state, which is usually\nUp. When it cannot reach a host and cannot\nreach another host in the same cluster either,\nit returns null and says \"I don't know\". This\nprevents it from reporting the problem. Now,\nwe return an Alert or Disconnected state so\nproper action can be taken.\n\nAlso logging was added, so we know what part\nof the code put it to Alert or Disconnected.\n\nWhen the host is available again, it goes\nfrom Alert state back to Up and CloudStack\nstarts HA work to recover the VMs. I tested\nit on 4.6/master and it works fine now.\n\nAs this is a nasty bug, we might want to fix\nthis also in 4.5 and 4.4.\n\nThanks to @dahn and @snuf for their\nhelp solving this issue.\n","created_at":"2015-04-29T12:41:51Z","updated_at":"2015-05-01T14:57:16Z","closed_at":"2015-04-29T13:01:03Z","merged_at":"2015-04-29T13:01:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"f71e937dd0b4bf2d5cf21c2f408b17a98b7f14a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/78e095e64b2344a49e96a7939ca6edd3b36d93dd","head":{"label":"remibergsma:investigator_null_state_fix","ref":"investigator_null_state_fix","sha":"78e095e64b2344a49e96a7939ca6edd3b36d93dd","user":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33662311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzY2MjMxMQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"remibergsma/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"remibergsma","id":1630096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzAwOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1630096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma","html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remibergsma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/remibergsma/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

the tests are skipped through setUpClass, the statement \"raise unittest.SkipTest()\" is used. This is seen as exception in the logs. To avoid this, alternatively we can set class level variable in setUpClass and read this variable value in a custom decorator. Decorator will skip or run test cases accordingly.\n\nThis patch demonstrates that, when test is run on a hypervisor on which the feature is not supported, we set \"hypervisorNotSupported\" variable to True and pass this variable as argument to the decorator.\nDecorator gets the value of this attribute, examines it, if it's true, skips the test case, or else runs the test case as it is.\n\nAlso the expensive steps in setUpClass are run only if hypervisor is supported.\n\nMiscellaneous changes:\n1.

fixes the issue of Security Groups not working in case of XenServer 6.5;\n- Uses nethash ipset data-structure to store CIDRs (efficient than iphash and\n  avoids overflow errors in case users add /8 /4 ingress/egress cidrs)\n- Support for ipset versions both on 6.2 and 6.5, both have different outputs. This\n  fixes the issue of destroy_network_rules_for_vm failing\n- Implements defensive filtering of list, instead of popping last item without\n  checking if it's None or empty\n- Greps using names that are 'quoted' to avoid bash errors\n- Before setting up new network rule, tries to clean and remove old ipset entry\n- Idents, whitespace and naming fixes\n\nPS.

rules were loaded in `iptables-persistent` service during boot.  So the first try was to save them where `iptables-persistent` reads them in /etc/iptables/rules.v4 / .v6.\n\nThe problem was, that the service `cloud-early-config` resets  /etc/iptables/rules.v4 / .v6 to the setup state. So even if you save iptables rules, they were overwritten during boot.\n\nThat is why a fix was made in 2fad87d to workaround the problem.\n\nI reverted the workaround and made sure /etc/iptables/rules.v4 / .v6. won't get overwritten by  `cloud-early-config`\n\nSigned-off-by: Rene Moser

Reducing complexity of function \"verifyVCenterPortGroups\". Earlier it had two for loops, now it has only one. The parameter zone_list has been replaced with \"zone\" because we map a VCenter to a zone and not multiple zones.\n2. Correcting the logic used to generate expected port group names for public traffic. The port group with network rate as defined in \"network.throttling.rate\" is created only when a VM is deployed and its network uses a public IP from public IP range dedicated to public traffic.\n3. Adding a wrapper function for verifying guest traffic port groups which creates vcenter connection object and calls verifyVCenterPortGroups function with GUEST_TRAFFIC as parameter. This function is very handy and can be called from any networking test case with only a single line call. This separates the additional logic from test case and moves it to this wrapper function.\n\nThe code has been tested against multiple types of Vmware deployments including mixture tagged and untagged traffic types and mixed switches (SVS and DVS).\n","created_at":"2015-04-11T09:16:53Z","updated_at":"2015-05-22T10:12:49Z","closed_at":"2015-04-14T05:57:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e65b4263146c9ddf64ac9e3a771c9f3d88e5f734","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/06fa6b3da3fa246fdb18dd0264210c9991fb4786","head":{"label":"gauravaradhye:8375","ref":"8375","sha":"06fa6b3da3fa246fdb18dd0264210c9991fb4786","user":{"login":"gauravaradhye","id":4161170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjExNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4161170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye","html_url":"https://github.com/gauravaradhye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":31648314,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTY0ODMxNA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"gauravaradhye/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gauravaradhye","id":4161170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjExNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4161170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye","html_url":"https://github.com/gauravaradhye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gauravaradhye/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gauravaradhye/cloudstack","description":"Mirror
