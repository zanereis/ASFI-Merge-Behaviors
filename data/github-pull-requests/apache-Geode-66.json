test was using the singletons just to confirm the cache had been shutdown. It was easy to change that test to not confirm the singleton was null but to instead ask if the test's cache was closed.\r\n\r\nThe other test was testing DataType which is product code that is only used by tests to inspect what is stored in offheap memory. The test was mocking the singleton methods because the product DataType was using the singleton to decode a serialized PDX. I changed DataType to just do less decoding of pdx. Now it will just say it was a pdx and give you the type

for GEODE-1758**\r\n\r\nThe pull request contains two different commits on purpose:\r\n\r\n- The first one includes all JUnit tests for the `TypeUtils` class, basically to make sure that the changes won't break existing behavior nor introduce new bugs.\r\n- The second one is the actual refactoring of the `TypeUtils` class without major modifications to the original tests, basically to make sure everything still works as expected.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following

adds a new PoolFactory setting allowing subscription connections to\r\ntime out and initiate failover to a backup server.  The new setting is\r\nsetSubscriptionTimeoutMultiplier:\r\n\r\n _A server has an inactivity monitor that ensures a message is sent to a client at least once a_\r\n _minute (60,000 milliseconds). If a subscription timeout multipler is set in the client it_\r\n _enables timing out of the subscription feed with failover to another server._\r\n\r\n _A value of zero (the default) disables timeouts_\r\n\r\n _A value of one will time out the server connection after one of its ping intervals (not_\r\n _recommended)_\r\n\r\n _A value of two or more will time out the server connection after that many ping intervals have_\r\n _elapsed_\r\n\r\nThe client/server handshake is modified for clients having version 1.5 or\r\nlater.  The server sends its ping-interval setting to the client.  The client\r\nthen uses this and the multiplier to establish a read-timeout in the\r\nCacheClientUpdater subscription processor.\r\n\r\nTwo tests are added to ensure that 1) the Message method that allows a\r\nread to timeout functions correctly and 2) the CacheClientUpdater\r\ncorrectly receives the multiplier setting.\r\n\r\n@upthewaterspout @PivotalSarge @galen-pivotal @WireBaron \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
