is continuous development of [original pull request](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3283) made by [nxmbriggs404](https://github.com/nxmbriggs404).**\r\n\r\nI am using Kafka primary on Windows platform; but [KAFKA-1194](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194) affects all Kafka versions on Windows and makes it unusable without restarts. There are several pull requests available to fix this problem but most of them are outdated. [Nxmbriggs404 pull request](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3283) is the most recent of them. Unfortunately, there is no further discussion and progress on forementioned pull request, so I created a new one.\r\n\r\nPull request contains the most recent merge of **apache/kafka** **trunk** branch into [original pull request](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3283) made by [nxmbriggs404](https://github.com/nxmbriggs404) with all related tests and code part adaptations.\r\n\r\nThe only major change is in the `LogManager.scala` file within `asyncDelete`. I had to change operations order for `removedLog` from\r\n\r\n1. Rename directory (atomic move) \r\n2. Make checkpoint log for offsets and recovery\r\n3. Mark for deletion\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n1. Make checkpoint log for offsets and recovery\r\n2. Close `FileChannel` to avoid `AccessDeniedException` on Windows\r\n3. Rename directory (atomic move)\r\n4. Mark for deletion\r\n\r\nNew order allows `LogManagerTest.testFileReferencesAfterAsyncDelete` to succeed on Windows.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am running long live test with all of the changes mentioned above. It seems to function as expected: log retention works. Setup is very simple - one broker.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- `LogCleanerTest.testRecoveryAfterCrash` fails\r\n\r\nThere is potentially more broken parts on Windows... than the original bug\r\n\r\nI think most Windows users would really like to see the old [KAFKA-1194](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194) issue being closed.

client instead of the one shipped with Java. That allows to keep the SSL configuration for Server and Client be in single place (both use the Jetty `SslContextFactory`). It also has much richer configuration than the JDK client (it is easier to configure things such as supported cipher suites etc.).\r\n- The `RestServer` class has been broker into 3 parts. `RestServer` contains the server it self. `RestClient` contains the HTTP client used for forwarding requests etc. and `SSLUtils` contain some helper classes for configuring SSL. One of the reasons for this was Findbugs complaining about the class complexity.\r\n- A new method `valuesWithPrefixAllOrNothing` has been added to `AbstractConfig` to make it easier to handle the situation that we want to use either only the prefixed SSL options or only the non-prefixed.

Connect Service in system tests to start asynchronously. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, allow for three startup conditions: \r\n1. No condition - start async and return immediately. \r\n2. Semi-async - start immediately after plugins have been discovered successfully. \r\n3. Sync - start returns after the worker has completed startup. This is the current mode, but its condition is improved by checking that the port of Connect's REST interface is open, rather than that a log line has appeared in the logs. \r\n\r\nAn associated

is a bug fix that is composed of two parts:\r\n\r\n1. The major part is, for all operators that is generating a KTable, we should construct its value getter based on whether the KTable itself is materialized.\r\n1.a If yes, then query the materialized store directly for value getter.\r\n1.b If not, then hand over to its parents value getter (recursively) and apply the computation to return.\r\n\r\n2. The minor part is, in KStreamImpl, when joining with a table, we should connect with table's `valueGetterSupplier().storeNames()`, not the `internalStoreName()` as the latter always assume that the KTable is materialized, but that is not always true.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-13T01:22:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-25T00:04:11Z","closed_at":"2018-01-18T21:14:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe6cc1e46eee673e492398849894724411f7e113","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/0161fe9ecfc6cdda9de04210bdec7c92fb5f6466","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K6398-KTableValueGetter","ref":"K6398-KTableValueGetter","sha":"0161fe9ecfc6cdda9de04210bdec7c92fb5f6466","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR is an initial attempt to evenly distribute tasks with heavy processing across clients using a somewhat naive approach.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is by making sure each task is not comprised entirely of the same `topicGroupId`s, \r\nthen if there is one sub-topology doing heavy processing and another sub-topology that is relatively light, the processing load is somewhat evenly distributed.\r\n\r\nThis process only looks at active tasks; standby tasks are not given this consideration as we can end up in a state where clients have the same task assignments i.e [aT1, sT2]

this patch, simple consumer groups which only use Kafka for offset storage will be viewable using the `--list` option. In addition, this patch fixes a bug in the offset loading logic which caused us to lose the protocol type of empty groups on coordinator failover. I also did some cleanup of the various consumer group command test cases.\r\n\r\nFor testing, I have added new integration tests which cover listing and describing simple consumer groups. I also added unit tests to cover loading empty groups with assertions on the protocol type.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n\r\n

already had findbugs running and it looks like sufficient warnings should cause errors. This PR does a few things. First, it changes to generating xml reports (which CI likes) by default. We already seem to have the Jenkins plugins setup to consume these, so we should immediately start seeing the output on Jenkins. This seems better than the current html default since most devs probably aren't looking at the html reports unless they are specifically looking at findbugs issues. Second, it explicitly sets the report level we want to trigger failures on.\r\n\r\nI think we were already failing the build based on the current settings, we just didn't have any high-level warnings. But this sets us up not to only fail the builds but also have some visibility via jenkins reports.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

This [dead code alert](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/kafka/snapshot/6abe9363dbc8d7295055865233071ef51dce1f3a/files/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/trogdor/rest/RestExceptionMapper.java?sort=name&dir=ASC&mode=heatmap&excluded=false#xbfc4f8e26024a8f4:1) where `InvalidTypeIdException` indirectly extends `JsonMappingException`. The flagged condition with the type test appears after the type test for the latter and thus makes its body dead. I opted to change the order of the tests. Please let me know if this is the intended behavior.\r\n\r\n2. The second commit addresses this [out-of-bounds alert](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/kafka/snapshot/6abe9363dbc8d7295055865233071ef51dce1f3a/files/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/security/kerberos/KerberosRule.java?sort=name&dir=ASC&mode=heatmap&excluded=false#x40b686b508503559:1).\r\n\r\nMore alerts can be found [here](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/apache/kafka/alerts/). Note that my colleague Aditya Sharad addressed some of those in the now outdated #2939.\r\n\r\n@mjsax I don't know any committers here, apart from you, so maybe you could have a look?

is something I did after my working hours, I would ask people reviewing this do the same, don't take time for this during your work hours.\r\n\r\nI try to keep such a PR as limited as possible, for clarity of reading.\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis PR is focussed on finding all places in the code where regular expressions are used dynamically and converting them to use statically compiled `Pattern` objects instead.\r\n\r\nThis prevents the regular expression from having to be compiled every single time it is used.\r\n\r\nAn explanation with code example can be seen here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1721778\r\n\r\nThe refactoring was done by going into the source code of String.java and Pattern.java. The code now seen here does it exactly that way I found it in the Oracle JDK source code zip file that's provided along with the install.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

a log entry is appended to a Kafka topic using `KafkaLog4jAppender`, the producer.send operation may block waiting for metadata. This can result in deadlocks in a couple of scenarios if a log entry from the producer network thread is also at a log level that results in the entry being appended to a Kafka topic.\r\n1. Producer's network thread will attempt to send data to a Kafka topic and this is unsafe since producer.send may block waiting for metadata, causing a deadlock since the thread will not process the metadata request/response.\r\n2. `KafkaLog4jAppender#append` is invoked while holding the lock of the logger. So the thread waiting for metadata in the initial send will be holding the logger lock. If the producer network thread has.a log entry that needs to be appended, it will attempt to acquire the logger lock and deadlock.\r\n\r\nThis is a temporary workaround to avoid deadlocks in system tests by setting log level to WARN for `Metadata` in `VerifiableLog4jAppender`.

Fix zk session state and session change rate metric names: type\r\nshould be SessionExpireListener instead of KafkaHealthCheck. Test\r\nverifying the fix was included.\r\n- Handle missing controller in controlled shutdown in the same way as if\r\nthe broker is not registered (i.e. retry after backoff).\r\n- Restructure BrokerInfo to reduce duplication. It now contains a\r\nBroker instance and the JSON serde is done in BrokerIdZNode\r\nsince `Broker` does not contain all the fields.\r\n- Remove dead code from `ZooKeeperClient.initialize` and remove\r\nredundant `close` calls.\r\n- Move ACL handling and persistent paths definition from ZkUtils to\r\nZkData (and call ZkData from ZkUtils).\r\n- Remove ZooKeeperClientWrapper and ZooKeeperClientMetrics from\r\nZkUtils (avoids metrics clash if third party users create a ZkUtils\r\ninstance in the same process as the broker).\r\n- Introduce factory method in KafkaZkClient that creates\r\nZooKeeperClient and remove metric name defaults from\r\nZooKeeperClient.\r\n- Fix a few instances where ZooKeeperClient was not closed in tests.\r\n- Update a few TestUtils methods to use KafkaZkClient instead of\r\nZkUtils.\r\n- Add test verifying SessionState metric.\r\n- Various clean-ups.\r\n\r\nTesting: mostly relying on existing tests, but added a couple\r\nof new tests as mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n\r\n

structure is immutable so it is possible to cache `hashCode` of a `Node` instance as it's done in the `TopicPartition` class.\r\nFaced with the producer performance degradation in case of high load and large number of brokers (100), topics (150) and partitions (350). Made several diagnostic records with the java flight recorder and found that the method `HashSet::contains` in [`RecordAccumulator::ready`](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/RecordAccumulator.java#L423) takes about 40% of the whole time of the application. It is caused by re-calculating a hash code of a [leader](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/RecordAccumulator.java#L433) (`Node` instance) for every [batch entry](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/internals/RecordAccumulator.java#L429). The cached hash code solved this issue and the corresponding time of `HashSet::contains` in `RecordAccumulator::ready` decreased to ~2%.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-21T16:51:01Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T22:11:00Z","closed_at":"2018-02-15T22:11:00Z","merged_at":"2018-02-15T22:11:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"004ef6b04bbc0ce0ebfc1cad42656559b043bcb2","assignee":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/milestones/1/labels","id":2994128,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjk5NDEyOA==","number":1,"title":"1.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"open","created_at":"2017-12-22T01:23:19Z","updated_at":"2024-10-17T03:05:33Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/78410f9a2ebb6cf912e005441f719ac185faac2c","head":{"label":"esevastyanov:node-hash","ref":"node-hash","sha":"78410f9a2ebb6cf912e005441f719ac185faac2c","user":{"login":"esevastyanov","id":1766814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjY4MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1766814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/esevastyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esevastyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":11498

the coordinator is marked unknown, we explicitly disconnect its connection and cancel pending requests. Currently the disconnect happens before the coordinator state is set to null, which means that callbacks which inspect the coordinator state will see it still as active. If there are offset commit requests which need to be cancelled, each request callback will inspect the coordinator state and attempt to mark the coordinator dead again. In the worst case, if there are many pending offset commit requests that need to be cancelled, this can cause a stack overflow. To fix the problem, we need to set the coordinator to null prior to cancelling pending requests.\r\n\r\nI have added a test case which reproduced the stack overflow with many pending offset commits. I have also added a basic test case to verify that callbacks for in-flight or unsent requests see the coordinator as unknown which prevents them from attempting to resend.\r\n\r\nNote that I have also included some minor cleanups which I noticed along the way.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

doesn't allow you to specify both a store name and the key/value serdes. If you specify the name using `#as`, then the serdes are implied/inferred to be for `Serde<Object>` and it becomes ugly to use `#withKeySerde`, `#withValueSerde`, etc. This overload of `Materialized#with` allows both the store name *and* the specific Serdes desired to be specified in one go.\r\n\r\nI've updated `MaterializedTest` with the expected new behaviour as well as the old
