Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

ValidatesRunner test suite has gotten obscenely slow due to the number of ValidatesRunner tests. There are currently over 250, and each one takes at least 3 minutes to run on Dataflow. Many of them don't actually need to be run on every worker, and this test converts them to `@NeedsRunner` tests instead.\r\n\r\nGradle also parallelizes tests differently, parallelizing at the test class level rather than per test case. As a result, the largest test class will be a bottleneck for the overall execution. This PR splits up large `@ValidatesRunner` test classes into scenario-based subclasses.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

creates a `release` task that emulates the workflow to create release candidates. The workflow for this is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Create environment variables. Supposing that we're preparing the 2.5.0 release:\r\nRELEASE=2.5.0\r\nNEXT_VERSION=2.6.0\r\nCANDIDATE=1\r\nBRANCH=release-${RELEASE}\r\n\r\n# Create a release branch\r\ngit branch ${BRANCH}\r\n\r\n# Now change the version in existing gradle files, and Python files\r\nsed -i 's/'$RELEASE'/'${NEXT_VERSION}'/g' build_rules.gradle\r\nsed -i 's/'$RELEASE'/'${NEXT_VERSION}'/g' gradle.properties\r\nsed -i 's/'$RELEASE'/'${NEXT_VERSION}'/g' sdks/python/apache_beam/version.py\r\n\r\n# Save changes in master branch\r\ngit add gradle.properties build_rules.gradle sdks/python/apache_beam/version.py\r\ngit commit -m \"Moving to ${NEXT_VERSION}-SNAPSHOT on master branch.\"\r\n\r\n# RELEASE TASK\r\n# In the release branch, run the release task\r\ngit checkout ${BRANCH}\r\n./gradlew release -Prelease.newVersion=${RELEASE}-SNAPSHOT \\\r\n                  -Prelease.releaseVersion=${RELEASE}-RC${CANDIDATE} \\\r\n                  -Prelease.useAutomaticVersion=true --info --no-daemon\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe release task must be performed each time a new Release Candidate is created, and once one is approved, then it's just necessary to add a new tag for the release:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit tag ${RELEASE} ${RELEASE}-RC${CANDIDATE}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe release task does the following:\r\n- Checks that no commits / updates are needed to the code\r\n- Checks that project has no SNAPSHOT dependencies\r\n- Runs build\r\n- Changes version in gradle.properties to remove `-SNAPSHOT`\r\n- Performs a commit\r\n- Adds a tag like so: `v${RELEASE}-RC${CANDIDATE}`\r\n- Changes version in gradle.properties back to contain `-SNAPSHOT`\r\n- Performs a commit","created_at":"2018-04-19T18:36:34Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T20:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T19:59:50Z","merged_at":"2018-04-25T19:59:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"b195516a51d9a7599612d810306d2ec6bec31b01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1f0e56d2fac1a6e29df06a294fe4b5a3541eca1d","head":{"label":"pabloem:gradle-release-branch","ref":"gradle-release-branch","sha":"1f0e56d2fac1a6e29df06a294fe4b5a3541eca1d","user":{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69611732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTYxMTczMg==","name":"beam","full_name":"pabloem/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pabloem","id":1301740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE3NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1301740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem","html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pabloem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pabloem/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `./gradlew build` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-19T17:31:42Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T23:16:03Z","closed_at":"2018-05-01T20:41:27Z","merged_at":"2018-05-01T20:41:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"643e3da528b7147c1e56023ac4868ad254c6cdaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f6d7c21f1701b6c0e30b0aefe474eeebac2acdd8","head":{"label":"swegner:findbugs_cleanup","ref":"findbugs_cleanup","sha":"f6d7c21f1701b6c0e30b0aefe474eeebac2acdd8","user":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52832170,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgzMjE3MA==","name":"beam","full_name":"swegner/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swegner","id":674021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDAyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner","html_url":"https://github.com/swegner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swegner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swegner/beam","description":"Mirror

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-19T15:58:33Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T22:59:31Z","closed_at":"2018-04-24T22:59:31Z","merged_at":"2018-04-24T22:59:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"cae963a810224ba6ce6c9623ee70fbaa57de9c11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4adf454f14a436efe07738f5aabf01c0ee03196a","head":{"label":"tgroh:bundle_collection_type","ref":"bundle_collection_type","sha":"4adf454f14a436efe07738f5aabf01c0ee03196a","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-19T01:16:19Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T03:56:18Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T03:56:17Z","merged_at":"2018-04-20T03:56:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"3eacf8b8d7301d1bd4db17874a31caf3b9949526","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f0c5d4c4fec37fb2a911889fe60480cc5e729440","head":{"label":"tgroh:rm_committed_bundle_proliferation","ref":"rm_committed_bundle_proliferation","sha":"f0c5d4c4fec37fb2a911889fe60480cc5e729440","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-18T23:34:54Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T18:13:56Z","closed_at":"2018-09-03T18:13:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65f5ac122bdea0cfe67538ff3bc0d076b509b7be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5176/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5176/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5176/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/8e5bd957d7419b8750e222952fe784f4ea039cf2","head":{"label":"huygaa11:globally","ref":"globally","sha":"8e5bd957d7419b8750e222952fe784f4ea039cf2","user":{"login":"huygaa11","id":4435399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzUzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4435399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11","html_url":"https://github.com/huygaa11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112401010,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTI0MDEwMTA=","name":"beam","full_name":"huygaa11/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huygaa11","id":4435399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzUzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4435399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11","html_url":"https://github.com/huygaa11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huygaa11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huygaa11/beam","description":"Apache

and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

[x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-18T18:25:39Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T19:25:58Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T19:25:58Z","merged_at":"2018-04-18T19:25:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0c5477112962caf4fe12a0083803ef0aac95d0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/28678ceb5ca7a5ece58ff16e154014ceacb3cac2","head":{"label":"udim:list-fixup","ref":"list-fixup","sha":"28678ceb5ca7a5ece58ff16e154014ceacb3cac2","user":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105834738,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MzQ3Mzg=","name":"beam","full_name":"udim/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/udim/beam","description":"Mirror

using DBInputFormat to fetch data from RDBMS, Beam parallelises the process by using LIMIT and OFFSET clauses of SQL query to fetch different ranges of records (as a split) by different workers. By default, RDBMS doesn't guarantee predicted order of results and for the same query it can be different every time. So, it can cause duplicates or missing of some rows in final result.\r\nTo guarantee the same order and proper split of results the client must order them by one or more keys (either PRIMARY or UNIQUE). It can be done by setting configuration option in Hadoop configuration.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-17T22:29:13Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T23:21:56Z","closed_at":"2018-04-17T23:21:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"386be26a2d58b8a502cfb9022451618155ec414b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3e804a0b75dfefe0e0351e399a48502ae38d1379","head":{"label":"tvalentyn:patch-9","ref":"patch-9","sha":"3e804a0b75dfefe0e0351e399a48502ae38d1379","user":{"login":"tvalentyn","id":9408864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDg4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9408864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn","html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":81976592,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTk3NjU5Mg==","name":"beam","full_name":"tvalentyn/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tvalentyn","id":9408864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MDg4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9408864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn","html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tvalentyn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tvalentyn/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-17T00:18:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T03:06:54Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T22:09:39Z","merged_at":"2018-04-25T22:09:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"5bb482f536e75bfacac91a546ab3db843dd2a25e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/5d5c052e890fb8af4bb9cd1a152300542feba0a2","head":{"label":"bsidhom:portable-runner-shim","ref":"portable-runner-shim","sha":"5d5c052e890fb8af4bb9cd1a152300542feba0a2","user":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110900797,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA5MDA3OTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"bsidhom/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom/beam","description":"Mirror

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-16T20:46:05Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T16:02:20Z","closed_at":"2018-05-01T16:02:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d9af5af4cd0c6a910cdb407c4343e5f24fcd87e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1f98f815c45dcd5728941b4dd6711a9a14b5b169","head":{"label":"tgroh:bundle_factory_shared_evaluators","ref":"bundle_factory_shared_evaluators","sha":"1f98f815c45dcd5728941b4dd6711a9a14b5b169","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-13T18:04:51Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T16:06:40Z","closed_at":"2018-04-16T16:06:40Z","merged_at":"2018-04-16T16:06:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ccdd54e6fc82b484cd25b49d60892a807d4c7e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5125/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5125/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5125/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1ce52d709bd4a109a4c0f74d99655572ee82224b","head":{"label":"tgroh:pipeline_options_rm_from_context","ref":"pipeline_options_rm_from_context","sha":"1ce52d709bd4a109a4c0f74d99655572ee82224b","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

generate subranges as needed.\r\nIt will respect data locality and avoid generating splits that would cover several token ranges as it would involve potentially many nodes in the cluster.\r\nThe

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

using the FnAPI, make it so that Combine.GroupedValues are not\r\nreplaced by the Dataflow specific PTransforms. The reason for this is\r\nto allow the Combines to be translated to a Dataflow pipeline as the\r\nconstituent parts of the composite transform (in other words, send\r\nDataflow a GBK and a ParDo, instead of a CombineGroupedValues black\r\nbox).\r\n\r\nThis does not fully accomplish the final goal of portable combines since\r\nthis method doesn't do anything to help Combiner lifting, but it works\r\nfor the case of the basic Combine that has been implemented. It\r\nsuccessfully treats the Combine as a GBK and ParDo when not lifted.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes will need to be made to detect when we want to lift\r\nCombines and in those situations handle that properly, which may mean\r\nputting the Combines in the black box.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Support staging binary (wheel) distributions of  Beam SDK to Dataflow. This can help reduce worker startup time latency for Beam users on Dataflow runner.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two changes to current behavior:\r\n1) If `--sdk_location points to a wheel`, the staged SDK file name will not be renamed to `dataflow_python_sdk.tar`, instead original name will be used.\r\n2) If `--sdk_location` is not set, try to download and stage both SDK sources and SDK wheel from PyPi. Wheel file is downloaded and staged on a best effort - if PyPi does not have desired wheel, only the sources will be staged, and pipeline execution will continue.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License
