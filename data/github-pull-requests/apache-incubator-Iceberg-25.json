Similar to Apache Spark™, we have released Maven artifacts for both Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"https://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/\">https://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/</a></li>\n<li>Maven artifacts: <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-core_2.12/2.4.0/\">delta-core_2.12</a>, <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-core_2.13/2.4.0/\">delta-core_2.13</a>, <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-contribs_2.12/2.4.0/\">delta-contribs_2.12</a> <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-contribs_2.13/2.4.0/\">delta_contribs_2.13</a>, <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-storage/2.4.0/\">delta-storage</a>, <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/delta/delta-storage-s3-dynamodb/2.4.0/\">delta-storage-s3-dynamodb</a></li>\n<li>Python artifacts: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/delta-spark/2.4.0/\">https://pypi.org/project/delta-spark/2.4.0/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The key features in this release are as follows</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-4-0.html\">Apache Spark 3.4</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1591\">Support</a> writing <a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#deletion-vectors\">Deletion Vectors</a> for the <code>DELETE</code> command. Previously, when deleting rows from a Delta table, any file with at least one matching row would be rewritten. With Deletion Vectors these expensive rewrites can be avoided. See <a href=\"https://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/delta-deletion-vectors.html\">What are deletion vectors?</a> for more details.</li>\n<li>Support for all write operations on tables with Deletion Vectors enabled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/9fac2e6af313b28bf9cd3961aa5dec8ea27a2e7b\">Support</a> <code>PURGE</code> to remove Deletion Vectors from the current version of a Delta table by rewriting any data files with deletion vectors. See the <a href=\"https://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/delta-deletion-vectors.html#apply-changes-with-reorg-table\">documentation</a> for more details.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/1701\">Support</a> reading Change Data Feed for tables with Deletion Vectors enabled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/7c352e9a0bf4b348a60ca040f9179171d2db5f0d\">Support</a> <code>REPLACE WHERE</code> expressions in SQL to selectively overwrite data. Previously “replaceWhere” options were only supported in the DataFrameWriter APIs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/c53e95c71f25e62871a3def8771be9eb5ca27a2e\">Support</a> <code>WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE</code> clauses in SQL for the Merge command.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/422a670bc6b232e451db83537dcad34a5de97b67\">Support</a> omitting generated columns from the column list for SQL <code>INSERT INTO</code> queries. Delta will automatically generate the values for any unspecified generated columns.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1626\">Support</a> the <code>TimestampNTZ</code> data type added in Spark 3.3. Using <code>TimestampNTZ</code> requires a Delta protocol upgrade; see the <a href=\"https://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/versioning.html\">documentation</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Other notable changes\n<ul>\n<li>Increased resiliency for S3 multi-cluster reads and writes.\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1711\">Use</a> a per-JVM lock to minimize the number of concurrent recovery attempts. Concurrent recoveries may cause concurrent readers to see a <code>RemoteFileChangedException</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/1712\">Catch</a> any <code>RemoteFileChangedException</code> in the reader and retry reading.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/303d640a\">Allow</a> changing the column type of a <code>char</code> or <code>varchar</code> column to a compatible type in the  <code>ALTER TABLE</code> command. The new behavior is the same as in Apache Spark and allows upcasting from <code>char</code> or <code>varchar</code> to <code>varchar</code> or <code>string</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/579a3151db611c5049e5ca04a32fc6cccb77448b\">Block</a> using <code>overwriteSchema</code> with dynamic partition overwrite. This can corrupt the table as not all the data may be removed, and the schema of the newly written partitions may not match the schema of the unchanged partitions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/83513484\">Return</a> an empty <code>DataFrame</code> for Change Data Feed reads when there are no commits within the timestamp range provided. Previously an error would be thrown.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/5ab678db\">Fix</a> a bug in Change Data Feed reads for records created during the ambiguous hour when daylight savings occurs.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/28148976\">Fix</a> a bug where querying an external Delta table at the root of an S3 bucket would throw an error.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/commit/81c7a58e\">Remove</a> leaked internal Spark metadata from the Delta log to make any affected tables readable again.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: the Delta Lake 2.4.0 release does not include the <a href=\"https://docs.delta.io/2.4.0/delta-utility.html#convert-an-iceberg-table-to-a-delta-table\">Iceberg to Delta converter</a> because <code>iceberg-spark-runtime</code> does not support Spark 3.4 yet. The Iceberg to Delta converter is still supported when using Delta 2.3 with Spark 3.3.</p>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>Alkis Evlogimenos, Allison Portis, Andreas Chatzistergiou, Anton Okolnychyi, Bart Samwel, Bo Gao, Carl Fu, Chaoqin Li, Christos Stavrakakis, David Lewis, Desmond Cheong, Dhruv Shah, Eric Maynard, Fred Liu, Fredrik Klauss, Haejoon Lee, Hussein Nagree, Jackie Zhang, Jintian Liang, Johan Lasperas, Lars Kroll, Lukas Rupprecht, Matthew Powers, Ming DAI, Ming Dai, Naga Raju Bhanoori, Paddy Xu, Prakhar Jain, Rahul Shivu Mahadev, Rui Wang, Ryan Johnson, Sabir Akhadov, Satya Valluri, Scott Sandre, Shixiong Zhu, Tom van Bussel, Venki Korukanti, Vitalii Li, Wenchen Fan, Xi Liang, Yaohua Zhao, Yuming Wang</p>\n<h2>Delta Lake 2.3.0</h2>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of <a href=\"https://github.com/delta-io/delta/releases/tag/v2.3.0\">Delta Lake 2.3.0</a> on <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-3-2.html\">Apache Spark 3.3</a>.

the minimum supported JDK from JDK 11 to JDK 17 in a future release of Error Prone, see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803\">#3803</a>. Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass <code>--release 11</code> to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.

PR has code to parallelize reading of deletes and enable caching them on executors.\r\n\r\nI also have a follow-up change to assign tasks for one partition to the same executor, similar to `KafkaRDD`. There is no way to express task affinity so we can only rely on task locality. The solution in `KafkaRDD` is simple to implement but won't work well if dynamic allocation is enabled (so it should be hidden under a flag).\r\n\r\nMore thoughts in

lcov</code> command ignored the <code>[report] exclude_lines</code> and\n<code>[report] exclude_also</code> settings (<code>issue 1684</code><em>).  This is now fixed,\nthanks <code>Jacqueline Lee &lt;pull 1685_&gt;</code></em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the coverage.py database\nfiles.  These are ephemeral, but could be mistakenly included when combining\ndata files.  Now they are always ignored, fixing <code>issue 1605</code>_. Thanks to\nBrad Smith for suggesting fixes and providing detailed debugging.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files, which should be\na little faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The new 3.12 soft keyword <code>type</code> is properly bolded in HTML reports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the &quot;fullcoverage&quot; feature used by CPython to measure the coverage of\nearly-imported standard library modules.  CPython <code>stopped using it &lt;88054_&gt;</code>_ in 2021, and it stopped working completely in Python 3.13.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _issue 1605: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1605\">nedbat/coveragepy#1605</a>\n.. _issue 1684: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1684\">nedbat/coveragepy#1684</a>\n.. _pull 1685: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1685\">nedbat/coveragepy#1685</a>\n.. _88054: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/cpython/issues/88054\">python/cpython#88054</a></p>\n<p>.. _changes_7-3-1:</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/a31651334302444cbd3e7b8a2d8a8ba5d5d65e4e\"><code>a316513</code></a> build: fix the pypy wheel arguments</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/7ec2c62a1a9dfff99832255d923e826141395a46\"><code>7ec2c62</code></a> docs: sample HTML for 7.3.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/ffd954f780211fd4debfe4980a5e0eac12d9390d\"><code>ffd954f</code></a> docs: prep for 7.3.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/1ea390783d62797f4134c4b40daf008ac9bc8634\"><code>1ea3907</code></a> refactor: don't access frame structs directly</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/7b8dec9a2ef9e0abe50607982b79e6454d0e4ec8\"><code>7b8dec9</code></a> feat!: remove fullcoverage, it doesn't work in 3.13</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/1040bcedcce22932d67845a2f8a6c83720f1af31\"><code>1040bce</code></a> refactor: remove unused interned strings</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/9ab9e0cf41682cbeec08957a582a11d2522e2485\"><code>9ab9e0c</code></a> fix: 3.12 soft keyword <code>type</code> is bolded in HTML</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/8624ce9662932f92cf203ef75039204d3ac84d6d\"><code>8624ce9</code></a> fix: really turn off SQLite journal files on 3.12+</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/604aafa5327eed17eb3d8927748850c97127f1ea\"><code>604aafa</code></a> chore: make upgrade</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/commit/7c25ba0ad96ebbd1b1313677c5efc89f8226cea4\"><code>7c25ba0</code></a> fix: don't combine journal files. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1605\">#1605</a></li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/compare/7.3.1...7.3.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=coverage&package-manager=pip&previous-version=7.3.1&new-version=7.3.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

were added to help users migrate and avoid bugs.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5650</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A warning-like category for performance hints was added that bypasses <code>-Werror</code>.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5673</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FastGIL now uses standard <code>thread_local</code> in C++.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5640</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>reference_wrapper</code> was added to <code>libcpp.functional</code>.\nPatch by Vyas Ramasubramani.  (Github issue :issue:<code>5671</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>cythonize</code> command now supports the <code>--cplus</code> option known from the <code>cython</code> command.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5736</code>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugs fixed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Performance regressions where the GIL was needlessly acquired were fixed.\n(Github issues :issue:<code>5670</code>, :issue:<code>5700</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A reference leak for exceptions in Python 3.12 was resolved.\nPatch by Eric Johnson.  (Github issue :issue:<code>5724</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>fastcall</code> calls with keyword arguments generated incorrect C code.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5665</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assigning the type converted result of a conditional (if-else) expression\nto <code>int</code> or <code>bool</code> variables could lead to incorrect C code.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5731</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Early (unlikely) failures in Python function wrappers no longer set a\ntraceback in order to simplify the C code flow.  Being mostly memory\nallocation errors, they probably would never have created a traceback anyway.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5681</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Relative cimports from packages with <code>__init__.py</code> files could fail.\n(Github issue :issue:<code>5715</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several issues with the Limited API support were resolved.\n(Github issues :issue:<code>5641</code>, :issue:<code>5648</code>, :issue:<code>5689</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The code generated for special-casing both Cython functions and PyCFunctions was cleaned up\nto avoid calling C-API functions that were not meant for the other type respectively.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

(Tabular) would like to submit our Iceberg Kafka Connect sink connector to the Iceberg project. Kafka Connect is a popular, efficient, and easy to use framework for reading from and writing to Kafka. This sink gives Iceberg users another option for landing data from Kafka into Iceberg tables. Having the backing of the Iceberg community will help it evolve and improve over time.\r\n\r\nThe sink codebase is on the larger side, so the thought was to break the submission into different PRs to make it easier to review. This initial PR includes the starting build setup and the project for the Avro event data structures.\r\n\r\nThe original repo can be found at https://github.com/tabular-io/iceberg-kafka-connect. Some design docs can be found in the `docs` directory, and that includes an explanation of what the events are used for, and why Avro was chosen for serialization.\r\n\r\nThe events were put in a separate project so the library can be used independently to read messages from the control topic outside of the connector, for debugging or notification

format. We suggest you use the <code>EXPORT DATABASE</code> command with the old version followed by <code>IMPORT DATABASE</code> with the new version to migrate your data. See the <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export\">documentation</a> for details.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[Dev] Merge master into feature by <a

raised a point on Slack of the semantic meaning of a field that can be written:\r\n\r\nhttps://apache-iceberg.slack.com/archives/C03LG1D563F/p1695834739711569\r\n\r\nThere are two options:\r\n\r\n- The field is not part of the schema, and is omitted from the file\r\n- The field is part of the schema, but the value is not written (nullable)\r\n\r\nMy personal take on this is that we should use static schema when writing Avro files so that all the fields that are either optional or required are in the schema.\r\n\r\nI'm well aware that this doesn't impose any issues if you dogfood the Iceberg Avro reader, where you can add required fields, for example, the `134: content` field in the manifest.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we should try to stick to the concept of writing strictly, read permissive where we try to encourage people to write all the fields that are in the spec (even if the value itself is all null).","created_at":"2023-09-28T08:18:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T06:50:34Z","closed_at":"2024-04-26T06:50:30Z","merged_at":"2024-04-26T06:50:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"5821efcdd521fa4d0f244500d3edb5e1c9e06311","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3354907790,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzU0OTA3Nzkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/iceberg/labels/Specification","name":"Specification","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":"Issues

PR is a culmination of my work in the [making-iceberg-docs](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/making-iceberg-docs) repository.\r\n\r\nTo see a preview, you can [check out the GitHub page](https://bitsondatadev.github.io/making-iceberg-docs/). We will eventually want to migrate this to using the iceberg GitHub pages to deploy the docs.\r\n\r\nDesign Discussion: https://lists.apache.org/thread/nq283g83p9cgx518jwo7dg85fm5gjrvv\r\nDesign Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WJXzcwC6isfoywcLY2lZ9gZN6i0JU1I2SIZmCkumbZc/edit#heading=h.gli9mc2ghfz1\r\n\r\nPhase 1 Goals:\r\n- Avoid changing the words and content themselves.\r\n- Migrate away from Hugo front matter and syntax and migrate to [MkDocs-Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) syntax.\r\n- Fix broken links and verify using linkchecker.\r\n- Combine the static (evergreen) pages and the versioned documentation into a single repository. \r\n- Adjust the structure to match the layout of the website itself, where `./site/*.md` contains the evergreen content and `./site/docs/<version>/*.md` contains the versions of Iceberg.\r\n- Keep all versioned javadocs in [their own tag](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/making-iceberg-docs/tree/javadoc).\r\n- Keep each version of the versioned Iceberg docs in [their own tag](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/making-iceberg-docs/tree/docs-1.3.1) separate from the [equivalent release tag](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/tree/apache-iceberg-1.3.1) to enable future updates to older doc versions.\r\n- Set up an all encompassing build using Spotify's [backstage/mkdocs-monorepo-plugin](https://github.com/backstage/mkdocs-monorepo-plugin) and [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to build multiple sub-repositories to include the static root pages, the javadoc, and docs tags, and deploy these in a single site that is searched on.\r\n- Ensure backwards compatibility with the existing site urls to avoid breaking permalinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase 2/3 and Todos:\r\n- Add [Vale](https://vale.sh/) and style/grammar fixes.\r\n- Style the webpage to match the existing <https://iceberg.apache.org>.\r\n- Getting Started guide.\r\n- Split content based on [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).\r\n- Fix linting errors and add Vale to the build process.\r\n- Add linkChecker to the build process.\r\n- Move python
