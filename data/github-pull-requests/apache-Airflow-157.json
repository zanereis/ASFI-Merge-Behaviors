you have several machines running Airflow and their time\r\nis not synchronized, you might get very weird behaviour - some of\r\nthe log retrieval actions might randomly return \"forbidden\"

is important to use Pendulum in case timezone is used - because\r\nthere are a number of limitations coming from using stdlib\r\ntimezone implementation.\r\n\r\nHowever our documentation was not very clear about it, especially\r\nsome examples shown using standard datetime in DAGs which could\r\nmislead our users to continue using datetime if they use timezone.\r\n\r\nThis PR clarifies and stresses the use of pendulum is necessary\r\nwhen timezone is used. Also it points to the documentation\r\nin case serialization throws error about not using Pendulum\r\nso that the users can learn about the reasoning.\r\n\r\nSee also #20070\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

wrapper scripts in static checks were remnant of old approach\r\nof running the static checks. They were there for those who\r\ndid not want to use pre-commit and they provided extra parameters\r\nthat could be passed and variables that could be used and\r\nprovided more verbose output. This is however all possible with\r\nthe `pre-commit` command and we are all used to run pre-commit\r\nand we even have missing auto-complete for those in Breeze\r\nso there is no need to keep the wrappers around.\r\n\r\nThe static-checks folder remains now only for the real\r\n\"static check\" actions that are run directly from CI:\r\n\r\n* running all static checks\r\n* running only basic static checks\r\n* running www lint\r\n* running ui lint\r\n\r\nThose scripts are directly referred from the ci.yml worflow,\r\nthus the \"scripts/ci/static-checks\" is now back to what it was\r\norignally used for.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is another PR that is likely much too big. Many (sort of interrelated) things done in one.\r\n\r\n#### Rewrite `@task` mapped operators expansion so it behave correctly\r\n\r\nPreviously, a mapped `@task` was not expanded correctly because its mapped argument would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmapped_arguments={\r\n    \"op_kwargs\": {\r\n        \"arg\": [1, 2, 3],\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis cannot be expanded using normal logic, because `PythonOperator` natively expects something like this instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmapped_arguments={\r\n    \"op_kwargs\": [\r\n        {\"arg\": 1},\r\n        {\"arg\": 2},\r\n        {\"arg\": 3},\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso additional logic is implemented to modify `expand_mapped_task` to correctly expand.\r\n\r\n#### Re-implement `expand_mapped_task` logic to be able to expand literals\r\n\r\nPreviously, `expand_mapped_task` only looks in TaskMap and cannot expand e.g. `.map(arg=[1, 2, 3])`. This implements a more sophisticated logic to collect information from mapped arguments and expand literal and XComArg inputs properly. Some refactoring was also done so the same logic can be reused for task-runtime value unpacking.\r\n\r\n#### Additional checks added to ensure correct literal types are passed to `.map()`\r\n\r\nBasically making sure it only receives lists and dicts (or XComArg, which is already checked separately when the upstream pushes to XCom).\r\n\r\n#### Extend `TaskInstance.render_templates` to “unpack” mapped values for task execution\r\n\r\nThis is the main thing. After all template fields are rendered, additional process is done to “unpack” mapped values into individual ones based on map_index, which further mutates the operator object held by a TaskInstance. This reuses similar logic from `expand_mapped_task` to calculate the total length of map, so it can locate its map_index inside the series.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `render_template_fields` was only implemented on BaseOperator, and a MappedOperator is first unmapped before templates are rendered. This approach was unforuantely wrong, since value unpacking (which needs to happen after template rendering resolves XComArg) needs to be aware of the original MappedOperator (mainly to access the user-supplied mapped kwargs). So the new logic delays unmapping until _during_ `render_templates`. If a TaskInstance’s `task` is a MappedOperator, its `render_templates` would call the MappedOperator’s `render_template_fields`, which unmaps itself, calls `render_template_fields` on the unmapped operator, unpacks values for the unmapped operator, _and then returns the unmapped operator_. The TaskInstance would reassign its `task` to the unmapped, rendered, unpacked operator. This means that `TaskInstance.render_templates` now may have a side effect of mutating its own `task` attribute. I don’t particularly like this, but couldn’t find a cleaner approach without breaking much of the existing interface (complicated by the fact that both `BaseOperator.render_template_fields` and `BaseOperator.render_template` are public API). I think this is close to the best possible interface considering existing constraints (and I try to document this as clearly as possible for future maintainability).\r\n\r\nA few tests were added to check this is working (see

rewrites `expand_mapped_task()` to inspect `mapped_kwargs` and make itself useful for mapping against literals (which are not recorded in `TaskMap`), and should work for things like

right (e.g. mapping against a *mapped* upstream), but this new logic should be useful for what we're going to need to

last remaining step to get (simple) Mapped tasks running in the scheduler was to expand the unmapped TIs when necessary. The interface of `MappedOperator.expand_mapped_task` is not right, and will be changed shortly, but this is enough to get work on the UI and APIs unblocked.\n\nSince there are a lot of moving parts in mapped tasks I have created the tests as \"integration\"/\"end-to-end\" tests rather than pure unit tests, and marked them as long_running (even if they only take sub 20s right now.)\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

the revision table in `migrations-ref.rst` is fully automated.\r\n\r\n* I updated each migration file to have the latest description from the migrations-ref doc.\r\n* I updated each migration file to include a literal constant expressing the version in which the migration was (or is expected to) be released\r\n\r\nWhen a new migration file is committed, the pre-commit hook will insert the (expected release) airflow version (if it wasn't added manually).  Then we'll walk the revisions, update the docs table, ~and update the version-revision map constant (for now  located in db.py)~.\r\n\r\nI had to make it a breeze hook since it depends on airflow itself.\r\n\r\n~Since we store the revision map in db.py, the hook will have to run every time db.py is modified.  If that proves to be annoying, we can move the constant elsewhere.~\r\n\r\n# How you can quickly verify this works locally\r\n\r\nTest 1 - change version: Open `airflow/migrations/versions/c306b5b5ae4a_switch_xcom_table_to_use_run_id.py` and change the airflow version.  Observe that ~map constant and~ migrations ref are updated.\r\n\r\nTest 2 - new migration: Copy `airflow/migrations/versions/c306b5b5ae4a_switch_xcom_table_to_use_run_id.py` and name `airflow/migrations/versions/c306b5b5ae4a_switch_xcom_table_to_use_run_id_2.py`.  Make it a new revision `c306b5b5ae4a2` with down_revision=`c306b5b5ae4a` and remove line with `airflow_version` and try to commit.

tasks.\r\nThis option was currently not as easily accessible, only through the DagRun view.\r\nNote: I choose to add only `Queue` and not `Running` as running could potentially go over the limit of

sending configs to Airflow workers we materialize a temp config file. In #18772 a feature was added so that `_cmd` generated secrets are not written to the files in some cases instead favoring maintaining the raw `_cmd` settings. Unfortunately during materializing of the configs via `as_dict()` Airflow defaults are generated and materialized as well including defaults for the non `_cmd` versions of some settings. And due to Airflow setting precedence stating bare versions of settings winning over `_cmd` versions it results in `_cmd` settings being discarded:\r\nhttps://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/set-config.html\r\n\r\nThis change checks `_cmd`, env, and secrets when materializing configs via `as_dict()` so that if the bare versions of the values is exactly the same as Airflow defaults and we have \"hidden\" / special versions of these configs that are trying to be set we remove the bare versions so that the correct version can be used.\r\n\r\ncloses: #20092\r\nrelated: #18772 #4050\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
