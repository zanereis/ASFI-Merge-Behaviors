this PR, I mainly implemented the following features:\r\n1. Combining data collection using [Peer](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/api/v1/peer/peer_grpc.pb.go#L38) and [Flow](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/main/api/v1/observer/observer_grpc.pb.go#L41) services provided by Cilium itself and converting it to SkyWalking data, finally displaying it in UI.\r\n2. Added a `labelCount` function in the OAL engine for creating count statistics based on tags.\r\n3. Rewrite FieldsHelper to support ALS as well as Cilium.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Following https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/32175, we found that some flow data would be missing some metadata, so we cannot get both side metrics.

<Feature description>https://github.com/apache/skywalking/discussions/12063\r\n- [x] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [x] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature. \r\nActiveMQ single-node/ 2 single-nodes/ shared-file-master-slave have been tested.\r\n- [x] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n- [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/changes/changes.md).\r\n\r\nFor ActiveMQ Classic cluster:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"848\" alt=\"image\"

the JVM.\r\n- Heap Memory: capacity of heap memory.\r\n- GC: memory of ActiveMQ is managed by Java's garbage collection (GC) process. Compatible with JDK 1.6-17 with ActiveMQ classic(5.10.x ~ 6.1.0)\r\n- Enqueue/Dequeue/Dispatch/Expired Rate: growth rate of messages in different states.\r\n- Average/Max Enqueue Time: time taken to join the queue.\r\n\r\nFor ActiveMQ Classic broker:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"844\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/skywalking/assets/22817918/bd499ac2-3e68-44c8-acc0-75ee90584a20\">\r\n\r\n- Uptime: duration of the node.\r\n- State: 1 = slave node, 0 = master node.\r\n- Current Connentions: number of connections.\r\n- Current Producer/Consumer Count: number of current producers/consumers.\r\n- Increased Producer/Consumer Count: number of increased producers/consumers.\r\n- Enqueue/Dequeue Count: number of enqueue and dequeue.\r\n- Enqueue/Dequeue Rate: rate of enqueue and dequeue.\r\n- Memory Percent Usage: amount of memory space used by undelivered messages.\r\n- Store Percent Usage: space used by pending persistent messages.\r\n- Temp Percent Usage: space used by non-persistent messages.\r\n- Average/Max Message Size: number of messages.\r\n- Queue Size: number of messages in the queue.\r\n\r\nFor ActiveMQ Classic destination:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"839\"

unacknowledged messages of the queue.\r\n- Memory usage: usage of memory.\r\n- Enqueue/Dequeue/Dispatch/Expired/Inflight Count: number of messages in different states.\r\n- Average/Max Message Size: number of messages.\r\n- Average/Max Enqueue Time: time taken to join the queue.\r\n\r\nDue to the shortcomings of the activemq-5.x agent plugin, it can not suit hierarchy definition now.\r\nI have to fix the agent part later, then push the hierarchy definition.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-15T16:56:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T09:48:22Z","closed_at":"2024-04-18T04:33:00Z","merged_at":"2024-04-18T04:33:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e978261fcb2bf2f619b8f2a9586e1703107f0a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP
