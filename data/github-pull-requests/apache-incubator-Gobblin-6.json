Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1732\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nBefore, when sending change_property events, the GMCE publisher searches in the top level dataset directory for an example file. This could find files with other schemas/paths if there are different directories in the dataset directory. This PR changes it to search under the `TimeBasedWriterPartitioner.WRITER_PARTITION_PREFIX` folder if that config exists to avoid this.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was no reason why there was a list/for loop here before, because `ConfigurationKeys.DATA_PUBLISHER_DATASET_DIR` is a single path, so the for loop has been removed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated unit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

to race condition and incorrect API call, the yarn service both allocates too many containers and in rare cases has a discrepancy between the number of containers state due to race conditions.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1728] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1728\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDue to an inaccurate API call, Yarn service can endlessly request thousand of containers in edge case scenarios. This is wasteful and puts a large load on Yarn RM. We saw over 50k containers requested in edge case scenarios. After this fix, the number of containers is only ~6k-9k\r\n\r\n- This patch contains 2 main fixes:\r\n  - fix yarn service allocating too many containers\r\n  - non descriptive logs in yarn service that make it hard to debug production issues. \r\n\r\nThe reason the yarn service allocates too many containers is because when we ask Yarn, we inaccurately count the number of outstanding resource requests. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nYarnServiceTest passes (Although this test is not run in CI due to flakiness so I've added screenshot for \"it works on my machine\" 🤡 )\r\n<img width=\"655\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/196631573-12d5b6a5-f148-4e05-bca5-293424eb04d8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nStreaming pipeline works with proper PCM count over large number of hours for cluster size of ~300\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/196631414-40153b49-ae15-4a47-bbbd-be81d6c9d78c.png)\r\n\r\nBehavior where cluster would allocate 50k containers no longer occurred. Cluster only requests ~ 6k containers \r\n\r\nExample of new log lines\r\n```\r\n2022-10-21 11:25:36 PDT INFO  [main] org.apache.gobblin.yarn.YarnService 467 - Trying to set numTargetContainers=4, in-use helix instances count is 0, container map size is 8\r\n2022-10-21 11:25:36 PDT INFO  [main] org.apache.gobblin.yarn.YarnService 489 - Container counts for helixTag=GobblinKafkaStreaming (allocatedContainers=8, outstandingContainerRequests=0, desiredContainerCount=4, numContainersNeeded=-4)\r\n2022-10-21 11:25:36 PDT INFO  [main] org.apache.gobblin.yarn.YarnService 505 - Shrinking number of containers by 4 because numTargetContainers < totalAllocatedContainers (4 < 8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-18T23:13:17Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T21:30:35Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T21:30:35Z","merged_at":"2022-10-24T21:30:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"013a85e3b04b986cd4ca16458b246bac5ed949fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0443fae68221a21d7c85902216d3a76aa20afef4","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-yarnservice-bug-GOBBLIN-1728","ref":"mh-yarnservice-bug-GOBBLIN-1728","sha":"0443fae68221a21d7c85902216d3a76aa20afef4","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1724\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSupport a flowgraph format where nodes can be shared between subgraphs. This allows for less repetition and cleaner hierarchies within the flowgraph.\r\nIt will follow the following structure\r\n```\r\n/flowgraph\r\n../nodeA\r\n..../nodeB\r\n......edgeAB.properties\r\n../nodeB\r\n....nodeB.properties\r\n/nodes\r\n..nodeA.properties\r\n..nodeB.properties\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhere nodeA will use the shared properties, and nodeB will use the union of the properties in nodeB from /flowgraph and the shared properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-14T07:25:05Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T23:01:09Z","closed_at":"2022-10-20T23:01:09Z","merged_at":"2022-10-20T23:01:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"635e81f8bcf10099cddf93d4e35e23c905fc840c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3583/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3583/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3583/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3fa4204506df76855c54a2b31fd81f949f22ab52","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:shared-flowgraph","ref":"shared-flowgraph","sha":"3fa4204506df76855c54a2b31fd81f949f22ab52","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1726\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- [ ] Upgrade of Avro version to 1.9.\r\n- [ ] Usage of Avro compatibility helper to make avro 1.9 compatible changes (Refer - https://github.com/linkedin/avro-util).\r\n- [ ] Replaced deprecated public Jackson APIs with the ones compatible with Avro 1.9.\r\n- [ ] Replaced guava library import from avro shaded with direct guava libraries. \r\n- [ ] Upgraded jackson mapper to 2.x and kept jackson mapper 1.x for modules with hive, helix library dependency.\r\n- [ ] Test failure fixes due to upgrade changes. \r\n- [ ] Updated the Avro schemas and avro data with respect to default value, null handling etc. These are requred to fix the test failures.\r\n- [ ] LinkedIn github hive i.e. https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin-hive/tree/branch-1.0.1-avro fixes hive issues by using Avro compatibility helper and all the new hive artifacts are published to https://linkedin.jfrog.io/artifactory/gobblin-hive. Gobblin oss now depends on these artifacts instead of Apache hive.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- [ ] Fixed all the failed tests and gobblin CI looks all green.\r\n- [ ] Tested using internal jobs pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-13T22:29:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T23:29:53Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T23:29:53Z","merged_at":"2022-10-18T23:29:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"7eaa6e87ff091273311dcd4490d68dd96a61ae5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b97726da0b08903d16bf2a3c4fa639a01933273d","head":{"label":"abhisheknath2011:avro_1_9","ref":"avro_1_9","sha":"b97726da0b08903d16bf2a3c4fa639a01933273d","user":{"login":"abhisheknath2011","id":679579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTU3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011","html_url":"https://github.com/abhisheknath2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":379564417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzk1NjQ0MTc=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"abhisheknath2011/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhisheknath2011","id":679579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTU3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011","html_url":"https://github.com/abhisheknath2011","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhisheknath2011/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhisheknath2011/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1721] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1721\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently when we receive a job restart(handleUpdateJobConfigArrival), GobblinHelixJobLauncher will firstly call  helixTaskDriver.waitToStop to stop the workflow, then initiate the new one. We observe the behavior of Helix taking exceptionally long to stop the workflow, making the job state staying in STOPPING status. This will make waitToStop timeout and throw exception all the time, making the new flow never be able to launch.\r\n\r\nWe can utilize Delete API in this case since our job is stateless for Helix, to avoid job hanging.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-13T18:02:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T22:46:04Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T22:46:04Z","merged_at":"2022-10-24T22:46:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a6dcfc8f98229914c75d38d480b6e8af80a1085","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3fb20cc9d5ffc909d8bf82e67e24a20fa23c466d","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1721-provide-option-to-cancel-Helix-workflow-through-Delete-API","ref":"GOBBLIN-1721-provide-option-to-cancel-Helix-workflow-through-Delete-API","sha":"3fb20cc9d5ffc909d8bf82e67e24a20fa23c466d","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1723\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSometimes hive writer hits AlreadyExistsException when adding a partition because of metastore slowness/timeout when checking existence of the partition. Since the partition has already been added, there's no need to throw an exception/fail in this case, so skipping in the case of this exception.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-13T17:33:15Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T22:48:03Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T22:48:03Z","merged_at":"2022-10-13T22:48:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3880d6d28e75d98b3ff6c1960b8329c029f367b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d731a7cfa2e0ab91ea1d6fa83292ecd4dc9da412","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:hive-writer-exception","ref":"hive-writer-exception","sha":"d731a7cfa2e0ab91ea1d6fa83292ecd4dc9da412","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1722\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd log lines when committing/retrieving watermarks to help debug issues where watermarks are not advancing as expected. These are probably useful to see in general anyway.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested log line in test pipeline\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1712\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTransient errors during shutdown like \"Filesystem closed\" can cause GMCEs to get skipped when they would have succeeded on the restart. Adding a list of exceptions like this that will fail the container to avoid data loss in these cases.\r\n\r\nAlso use `Throwables.getRootCause` to get a more meaningful exception message for the failure events since sometimes the events just have a generic \"Flush failed\" message right now.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-04T23:19:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-13T22:47:16Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T22:47:16Z","merged_at":"2022-10-13T22:47:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e221ed9c9290008e61eb87d13c3e93f606b2606","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/49e0eabbd0b3c370091628ef6522e538ba2884a0","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:gmip-transient","ref":"gmip-transient","sha":"49e0eabbd0b3c370091628ef6522e538ba2884a0","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1715) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAs mentioned in the ticket the existing array resizing is buggy for ORC's vectorized row batch.  In almost all the cases we should fall back on the 'enlargeFactor' option. In some cases where throughput may be a big concern. We should enable the proposed approach below.  We've seen some benefits of using the current approach. \r\n\r\n1. Major GC pauses have reduced\r\nBEFORE ![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129474/193365599-87151649-9edc-4849-9d20-227613715aba.png)\r\nAFTER ![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129474/193365616-82bad31f-b3b8-421e-94a2-043bf37a7082.png)\r\n\r\n3. Memory is only allocated when needed which when compared to the old approach allocated a lot more memory even when it was not required. [For details please see the ticket]\r\nBEFORE:  ![before2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129474/193365800-bad1b199-bc93-4029-9cc0-e82ab02211af.png)\r\nAFTER:  ![Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 3 41 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129474/193365939-f7bd7cca-213b-4603-a869-ef3f1093a5d4.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    4. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-30T22:44:38Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T20:36:06Z","closed_at":"2022-10-11T20:36:06Z","merged_at":"2022-10-11T20:36:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"fafd40b25fdd3e8f8299f9e939794ad7a2492314","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/02cf4376c41e44ddd56455d5bc3446e1f03de1bb","head":{"label":"rdsr:rbv2","ref":"rbv2","sha":"02cf4376c41e44ddd56455d5bc3446e1f03de1bb","user":{"login":"rdsr","id":129474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr","html_url":"https://github.com/rdsr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":528596584,"node_id":"R_kgDOH4G-aA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"rdsr/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdsr","id":129474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQ3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr","html_url":"https://github.com/rdsr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdsr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdsr/gobblin","description":"A

allow SpecStoreChangeMonitor to initialize partition and offsets\r\n* create unique group_id for each host's consumer client monitor\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1716\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDerived classes of HighLevelConsumer, for example SpecChangeMonitor, may want to initialize the kafka partitions and offset differently so we refactor the base class to grant this configurability. The default implementation remains the same as the original. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-28T00:04:43Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T18:13:05Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T18:13:05Z","merged_at":"2022-09-30T18:13:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"71da34b5d42e7b2c159ef241368b644a08de875d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9975a67061b1530fb6b221b56769b92acac99bf8","head":{"label":"umustafi:refactorHighLevelConsumer","ref":"refactorHighLevelConsumer","sha":"9975a67061b1530fb6b221b56769b92acac99bf8","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Enforce verification when this happens, so we know to create new, replacement connections (to a read-write host). Add additional logs to warn us when this query isn't set or if an exception occurs because of a connection issue. \r\n\r\nThis calls the parent class non-default constructor to utilize this check. It will overwrite the driverClassName, url, username, and password values set by the constructor. However it will keep the other properties. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  if (!Boolean.parseBoolean(properties.getProperty(SKIP_VALIDATION_QUERY, \"false\"))) {\r\n      // MySQL server can timeout a connection so need to validate connections before use\r\n      final String validationQuery = MysqlDataSourceUtils.QUERY_CONNECTION_IS_VALID_AND_NOT_READONLY;\r\n      LOG.info(\"setting `DataSource` validation query: '\" + validationQuery + \"'\");\r\n      this.basicDataSource.setValidationQuery(validationQuery);\r\n      this.basicDataSource.setTestOnBorrow(true);\r\n      this.basicDataSource.setTimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis(Duration.ofSeconds(60).toMillis());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1708\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Checks for validity of the next path to traverse by seeing if it's in the range of startDate to endDate by rounding the granularity of the startDate and endDate to match the granularity of the path traversed.\r\n- Enables for more efficient searching as we no longer have the build the entire tree, including the paths that fall outside of the range of the startDate and endDate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- The current tests for TimeAwareRecursiveCopyableDataset still pass as expected \r\n- Nothing changes for the user side, changes are in the underlying logic \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-16T00:18:26Z","updated_at":"2024-05-20T22:20:46Z","closed_at":"2022-09-22T23:46:11Z","merged_at":"2022-09-22T23:46:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"78484e23f0b5cdc5098f7438c22705db425140d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1eceb319bd9c2a47dae960613e221fd1d37bb604","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/TimeAwareRecursiveCopyableDataset-lookback-improvement","ref":"andjiang/TimeAwareRecursiveCopyableDataset-lookback-improvement","sha":"1eceb319bd9c2a47dae960613e221fd1d37bb604","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1710] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1710\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe should make codecov optional in the CI because:\r\n1. CodeCov computation itself is not deterministic and the resulting number is not actually a great coverage\r\n2. OSS forkers should not be required to make a codecov account in order to run CI in github actions\r\n3. Codecov API is sometimes flaky causing our CI pipeline to also be flaky\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested in this feature branch https://github.com/apache/gobblin/commit/ed460f021aeb0f86ecbc652e14a60c0b98326efb\r\nhttps://github.com/homatthew/gobblin/actions/runs/3055275438\r\n- Example of successful run\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    4. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    5. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    6. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    7. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-15T00:55:05Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T22:25:53Z","closed_at":"2022-09-15T01:54:25Z","merged_at":"2022-09-15T01:54:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ae4ec71e279bed55cd1d10ae0d3bd918fab1d44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3562/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3562/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3562/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1640dd923e224a60179032bc23e7a2c4248e4603","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-ci-codecov-optional-GOBBLIN-1710","ref":"mh-ci-codecov-optional-GOBBLIN-1710","sha":"1640dd923e224a60179032bc23e7a2c4248e4603","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

avoid accumulation of helix instances, we should clean up over time. But we can only perform the clean up at startup because it's unsafe to call the API while instances are being created / removed.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1704] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1704\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin streaming does not currently clean up helix instances.This means that after spikes in the number of gobblin task runners, causes accumulation in the `INSTANCES` znode, which will exceed the 1MB limit. This will cause zookeeper to either have delays or drop requests completely. \r\n\r\nThis change cleans up these offline instances on startup. We cannot periodically clean up these instances because it is not a concurrency safe API. Meaning that if we start adding helix instances while this making this call concurrently, we will see undefined behavior. \r\n\r\nHelix cluster with large number of offline instances\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/190070111-08cd840c-f2d2-49dd-859f-30a7b85c2f3b.png)\r\n- Launching gobblin job with lesser number of workunits / instances leads to a smaller instances size.\r\n<img width=\"519\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35702680/190288441-38936f44-a6e8-4dd6-9025-b9a287b3553b.png\">\r\n\r\nGTE Submitted to Kafka\r\n```\r\n\r\n|timestamp    |namespace   |name                               |metadata                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |datepartition|\r\n|-------------|------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\r\n|1663636297193|gobblin.yarn|HelixOfflineInstancePurge.Completed|{metricContextID=8c8f105c-167c-4f9c-8997-835bb9e0e02d, elapsedTimeMs=1000, application.id=application_1661798829266_2113373, application.name=<APPLICATION_NAME>, metricContextName=application_1661798829266_2113373}|2022-09-19-00|\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample logs from running UT's\r\n```\r\n2022-09-20 11:56:03 PDT INFO  [main] org.apache.gobblin.yarn.HelixInstancePurgerWithMetrics 53 - Waiting for helix to purge offline instances.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1707 - \"Add Iceberg support to DistCp\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nToward eventual full DistCp Iceberg support: walk an iceberg's metadata to determine all physical file paths for both metadata and actual data.  At present these are the full contents; subsequently we'll calculate a delta against previously copied data.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI tested manually, and working now to create a test iceberg that I could check into `src/test/resources`, which has no PII.  that would be a fast follow along w/ the test, if I'm unable to generate that before committing this (to share code and unblock collaborators).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-12T19:41:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T18:40:08Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T18:40:08Z","merged_at":"2022-09-13T18:40:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"da914e272c935c519af9d60c1b35a1ab59f1165e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f46c1f635575266382efa97694371dd9ccd0c937","head":{"label":"phet:iceberg_distcp__scan_icebergs","ref":"iceberg_distcp__scan_icebergs","sha":"f46c1f635575266382efa97694371dd9ccd0c937","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1705\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn the multi-leader version of GaaS, the REST API layer will not directly contact the `GobblinServiceJobScheduler` to respond to API requests. Instead after flow level updates are persisted to MySQL, this new monitor will subscribe to Kafka events informing it of Flow Spec changes corresponding to the API requests and trigger their execution. There will be a similar change to follow to respond to other API requests. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo testing added for now as it should be tested end to end with actual Kafka events \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-09T00:17:04Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T22:28:05Z","closed_at":"2022-09-23T22:28:05Z","merged_at":"2022-09-23T22:28:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"31f7ec5b748f965426e2e99928d467f451b37b72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b4003ca2c4ae3e75827a27d2a02a1126a2a13892","head":{"label":"umustafi:specStoreChangeEventMonitor","ref":"specStoreChangeEventMonitor","sha":"b4003ca2c4ae3e75827a27d2a02a1126a2a13892","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

If Gradle finds a module descriptor in a particular repository, it will attempt to download all of the artifacts for that module from the same repository.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1696\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin-as-a-Service only has a Git based flowgraph, which is difficult to build CI/CD around.\r\nThis is an alternate flowgraph that watches for file changes and applies updates.\r\nUnlike the git based flowgraph, changes in this flowgraph are atomic with respect to one deployment of the flowgraph, which is an update of multiple files.\r\nThis also requires an enhancement to the PathAlterationObserver to notify listeners if there is any change on a root level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1694\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n- Explicitly add the GMCE topic as a field in hive commit events. This was in the events before from gobblin framework, but in some situations (not sure why) the event submitter got reset and stopped including it in the events, so explicitly adding it now. For backwards compatibility keeping the name `kafkaTopic` for the key.\r\n- Also updated an iceberg writer log line to avoid blowing up the logs when gmip is going through older offsets (before it printed the entire GMCE which was extremely large).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in gmip test pipeline\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

test cases\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[[GOBBLIN-1692](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1692)] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1692\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen handleUpdateJobConfigArrival, a new job config gets posted, GobblinHelixJobScheduler will firstly stop and delete the old job, and try to spin up the updated helix workflow.\r\nThe job scheduler will try to do the stop synchronically with a default 10 seconds timeout setting. However, this stop constantly running longer than the timeout for Helix, causing the job state not correctly updated as stopped. Thus, when construct the GobblinHelixJobLauncher, we will have the previous job in a wrong state as jobRunningMap is not updated yet, causing the new job won’t being launched. So we always see this log: Job {} will not be executed because other jobs are still running. \r\n\r\nWe can make the job delete asynchronized, and let waitForJobCompletion method to ensure the job status get updated correctly eventually.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1686\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently we catch `RuntimeException` in `IcebergMetadataWriter.flush()` and rethrow another `RuntimeException`. We should throw `IOException` in all cases so that MCE writer will catch and be able to skip it in the case of a single dataset issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-22T21:29:37Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T17:40:25Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T17:40:25Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T17:40:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0d3c78d8d29435a7f68c4c086f605d6e0c9072c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/bafac30d61c9a5f5bceb2d8b49931223f2682a2b","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:iceberg-failures","ref":"iceberg-failures","sha":"bafac30d61c9a5f5bceb2d8b49931223f2682a2b","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1683] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1683\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1673\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe Dynamic work unit project is to enable gobblin streaming to modify the workunits from a source after the pipeline has started. \r\n \r\n\r\nIn order to do this, the task runner must communicate its current state back to the application master. This PR describes the data schema for communication and provides the skeleton code for the AM and gobblin task runner to communicate. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests added for serialization. No UT's added for interfaces because they are interfaces. No UT added for the background thread method since that is not an easy to test method.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-20T03:45:02Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T16:56:49Z","closed_at":"2022-09-12T16:56:48Z","merged_at":"2022-09-12T16:56:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0e530a78ae0417ea6e3ab6aeaeb4e2f260e227f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/94259caaead3e05a1f527654fede07b386ee2fbf","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-data-schema-GOBBLIN-1673","ref":"mh-data-schema-GOBBLIN-1673","sha":"94259caaead3e05a1f527654fede07b386ee2fbf","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Future improvements can be to also match folders against the date partition for that level before the recursive step, so that only the relevant folders will be searched.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Since we want to support file based flowgraphs, we should reuse as much logic as possible while maintaining the same interfaces.\r\n  \r\n  To achieve this, the PR treats the flowgraph monitor as a service, and has listeners which would be run by the service manager and needs to support a function to setActive(boolean). The rest of the flowgraph monitor would be registering listeners, to observe from an appropriate source (e.g. Git, Filesource), and the listeners would apply changes appropriately to the flowgraph based on the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSince this is purely a refactor, existing tests should not break with changes to internal components.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, the command uses 'nohup' and '&' which always makes it run in background.\r\nThis makes it inconvenient in use-cases that need to do some action after the run is\r\ncompleted (like curling for some logs). Hence, providing an option to choose whether\r\nto run in background or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in local environment with the new flag, unit tests Not applicable.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T19:06:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T23:11:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a1b3d3f9cdea6ee288248058e17fb40bdebfd69b","head":{"label":"bharos:GOBBLIN-1674","ref":"GOBBLIN-1674","sha":"a1b3d3f9cdea6ee288248058e17fb40bdebfd69b","user":{"login":"bharos","id":4263644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos","html_url":"https://github.com/bharos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517852305,"node_id":"R_kgDOHt3MkQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"bharos/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bharos","id":4263644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos","html_url":"https://github.com/bharos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bharos/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1675\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Add pagination feature to query from the specStore using start (first index of the specStore spec to return) and count (total number of specStore specs to return) for both getting all flows, and for getting filtered flows.\r\n- Returns specs in specStore between the indices of start and start + count - 1, inclusive\r\n- When pagination is included as part of the flow fetch, user can loop through all the pages until the end is reached to enable fetching large number of flow-configs. \r\n- This is needed in order to limit the number of flows returned, to avoid timeouts when large numbers are fetched without limit at once\r\n- Loop can be added on client side to achieve same behavior as no pagination for large queries\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Adds unit tests for filtered flows with pagination\r\n- Adds unit tests for all flows with pagination\r\n- E2E testing in GobblinServiceManager tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T00:34:30Z","updated_at":"2024-05-20T22:15:33Z","closed_at":"2022-08-18T20:28:53Z","merged_at":"2022-08-18T20:28:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"b069c134509d28322b08562d4b69954f2dff99c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/64cac625fdfd97026b0b3a2c58eb43a96fe88214","head":{"label":"AndyJiang99:andjiang/paginate-gaas-get-api","ref":"andjiang/paginate-gaas-get-api","sha":"64cac625fdfd97026b0b3a2c58eb43a96fe88214","user":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":364428142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjQ0MjgxNDI=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"AndyJiang99/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndyJiang99","id":20528968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI4OTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20528968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99","html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndyJiang99/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndyJiang99/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1672\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- Add more metrics related to flow management. Since a good chunk of the code in the DagManager was related to metrics emission, I tried to contain it within a class.\r\n- Adds the following metrics:\r\n1. Successes per executor\r\n2. Fails per executor\r\n3. SLA Exceeded per executor\r\n4. SLA Exceeded per flowgroup\r\n5. Total SLA Exceeded\r\n6. Jobs sent to spec executors\r\n7.  Start SLA exceeded per executor\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    5. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    6. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    7. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T23:39:43Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T22:02:32Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T22:02:32Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T22:02:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"35f16cb44d58dc5eca102e3633fcca2c9722bfaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/fb73d9476242686f790ab7870deb800ee72bd927","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:per-executor-metrics","ref":"per-executor-metrics","sha":"fb73d9476242686f790ab7870deb800ee72bd927","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1671\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen using `mapreduce` mode in gobblin.sh, the additional jars passed to\r\ngobblin.sh through --jars are comma separated. They are incorrectly\r\nadded to HADOOP_CLASSPATH that takes colon (:) separated jars. The fix is to convert the external jars to use colon instead of comma as delimiter when adding to the GOBBLIN_CLASSPATH, which in turn is used to set HADOOP_CLASSPATH\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally. The error was reproducible locally, which caused ClassNotFoundException.\r\nThe PR fixes the issue and jobs are able to get the dependent jars correctly.\r\nOtherwise, this PR does not seem to need tests as it's a script change which was verified.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-26T07:32:09Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T20:22:27Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T20:22:27Z","merged_at":"2022-08-08T20:22:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"13cef18cd2d9989a69fff2dbf56620e969f84736","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a8b260a7b82c9096be4d8fcfeb4770a2319793fe","head":{"label":"bharos:GOBBLIN-1671","ref":"GOBBLIN-1671","sha":"a8b260a7b82c9096be4d8fcfeb4770a2319793fe","user":{"login":"bharos","id":4263644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos","html_url":"https://github.com/bharos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517852305,"node_id":"R_kgDOHt3MkQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"bharos/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bharos","id":4263644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjM2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4263644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos","html_url":"https://github.com/bharos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bharos/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1670\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGithub Actions seems to have changed some settings under the hood which caused issues in the pipeline.\r\n1. Gradle task :rat  seems to fail due to not finding an xml to build the rat report. Since it's not useful in CI/CD easiest path forward is to disable the task\r\n2. Checkstyle is now checking generated code, but this should be disabled as well\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-21T00:00:43Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T16:41:10Z","closed_at":"2022-07-21T16:41:09Z","merged_at":"2022-07-21T16:41:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"2983607a7963ffccefeb5d66dd256e7079987b87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d123560672212809faae09e088597bef4d29f760","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-ci-cd-rat-report","ref":"fix-ci-cd-rat-report","sha":"d123560672212809faae09e088597bef4d29f760","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

outstanding ContainerRequests in Yarn\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1666] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1666\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nUsing a map to keep record of requested container count is error prone, as we may face synchronization issue and it's hard to decide when and where to decrease the count. Instead we can add allocated container count and outstanding ContainerRequests in AMRM as the requested count to avoid less/excessive container request.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-21T16:49:23Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T20:10:49Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T20:10:49Z","merged_at":"2022-06-21T20:10:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"7aad1f9ade24ad05ab797e150b6c03a03d925c04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3524/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3524/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3524/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b36c7254404a12ed2fe026db99a0abedfcb64b14","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1666-fix-calculation-requested-container-count","ref":"GOBBLIN-1666-fix-calculation-requested-container-count","sha":"b36c7254404a12ed2fe026db99a0abedfcb64b14","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1665] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1665\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe place we try to update(especially decrease) the requestedContainerCountMap is not correct now. Inside \r\n\r\nrequestTargetNumberOfContainers method, we should only increase the map if requestContainer is called. The place we should decrease the count in the map should be the place we shrink the container count, which means we're purposely releasing containers and won't spawn replacement.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nPassed all test cases. Tested in the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-17T00:07:59Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T18:29:00Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T18:29:00Z","merged_at":"2022-06-17T18:28:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"2414bc6ac20acdf749ef2de71e2c9ba9fc90b687","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/33e45f0cd84a1d4d4802a541248ed145d4c84ffc","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1665-Fix-bug-when-decreasing-requestedContainerCountMap","ref":"GOBBLIN-1665-Fix-bug-when-decreasing-requestedContainerCountMap","sha":"33e45f0cd84a1d4d4802a541248ed145d4c84ffc","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1664\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently if a table fails to write, we reset the writer that failed, and also remove it from the `tableOperationTypeMap` to avoid a no-op flush. However, if the writer that failed is not the first writer, there may still be other succeeding writers that we do want to flush. Removing this line so that we will still flush even if there was a failure of a writer for this situation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-13T21:30:04Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T19:01:03Z","closed_at":"2022-06-15T19:01:02Z","merged_at":"2022-06-15T19:01:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"fbc64e0072b627a101c5e66d03627007eab02772","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5fc3f1701bdbb862fd09a30f984c282d07bd29f0","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:gmip-flush-fix","ref":"gmip-flush-fix","sha":"5fc3f1701bdbb862fd09a30f984c282d07bd29f0","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1661] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1661\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    This change enable Helix instances use the specific tag defined(if exists) in their Job/Workflow. This makes the Helix cluster management easier and more strait forward, as each job's instances can carry unique Helix tag. \r\n\r\nIn this case, for each Gobblin job run, helix tasks within this job will\r\nbe assigned to containers with desired helix tag and resource. This can make within one Gobblin job run, multiple resource config can be set for different topics, instead of the need of creating new Helix cluster for different Gobblin job run setting.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nPassed all updated unit tests, tested in the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-09T05:37:35Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T19:27:42Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T19:27:42Z","merged_at":"2022-06-09T19:27:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"2463eda692b97d6947b21154abd37997a9ac3a73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8f21fc2bfe0341c677894d120d350ac15c56a2a0","head":{"label":"hanghangliu:GOBBLIN-1661-Make-Yarn-container-and-helix-instance-allocation-group-by-tag","ref":"GOBBLIN-1661-Make-Yarn-container-and-helix-instance-allocation-group-by-tag","sha":"8f21fc2bfe0341c677894d120d350ac15c56a2a0","user":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":264983661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjQ5ODM2NjE=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"hanghangliu/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hanghangliu","id":64626612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NjI2NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64626612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu","html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hanghangliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hanghangliu/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1658 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nRemove extra parameter from user side differentiating snapshot and partitioned copy. User shouldn't have to provide this flag. We can generalize the default values of partition format, column, and conflict policy without knowing this. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI updated the unit test for HiveDatasetDescriptor and am testing both snapshot and partition hive copies with local deployment of GaaS to see if the default values set work. [Will update here with details]\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-07T01:11:32Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T00:54:37Z","closed_at":"2022-11-16T00:54:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75a8f718c56a107a8872fa1be96ebb936674ad46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0a2b501bcd182225a20980e870ec359fd30d19d6","head":{"label":"umustafi:removePartitionedReferenceFromHiveDatasetDescriptor","ref":"removePartitionedReferenceFromHiveDatasetDescriptor","sha":"0a2b501bcd182225a20980e870ec359fd30d19d6","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

So want provide a config to set the minimum consumer rate and avoid abusing resources and small files\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1653\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nGobblin uses jobName to create folder paths for temporary work folders. In GaaS, the jobName is composed of the flowGroup, flowName, edge ID, and some hash. This combination can exceed the maximum folder component length if the flowName and flowGroup approaches their maximums (128 characters). \r\n\r\nInstead of enforcing a shorter flowGroup/flowName (which would require many db migrations), we should shorten the jobName sent to Gobblin as it's only used for temporary file storage. We would set the jobName as <flowGroup> + <hash> where hash is computed from the input path of the dataset\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1651\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently hiveRegister.close() waits for futures with no timeout, which could cause long delays in GMIP failing/restarting if there is hive slowness. Adding an option to configure this timeout, and by default in GMIP setting it to the same timeout as hive calls during normal operation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1650\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCertain GaaS flows can have a large number of flows that can cause instability on dependent services. We want to be able to control the throughput of flows from a flowgroup granularity on top of a user granularity. We keep the quota configuration separate as there can be many users submitting flows to the same flowgroup.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-1649] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1649\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe change made in [GOBBLIN-1633 ](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3494)may cause resourcing issues that affect other jobs because recompaction is expensive. The original change was made so that hive registration would be reattempted if there was a failure during the oncompleteactions. Ideally hive registration needs to happen another way or recompaction portion is skipped\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested on parallel pipeline (and verified that the \"bug\" is back) and that compaction works\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-18T00:39:45Z","updated_at":"2022-09-15T23:17:22Z","closed_at":"2022-05-18T22:59:57Z","merged_at":"2022-05-18T22:59:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"deb4f4860bf1b6a9db6db5fb608a036fdab40bce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/09b0bc2c77dd4065aad832389bad58de5a322224","head":{"label":"homatthew:mh-revert-compaction-GOBBLIN-1649","ref":"mh-revert-compaction-GOBBLIN-1649","sha":"09b0bc2c77dd4065aad832389bad58de5a322224","user":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":440270267,"node_id":"R_kgDOGj39uw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"homatthew/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"homatthew","id":35702680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzAyNjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35702680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew","html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/homatthew/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/homatthew/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1648\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nTo avoid Gobblin Cluster Manager downtime, observed during DB failover (when the currently connected instance which was active becomes a follower), detect once the connection on hand becomes read-only.  Enforce verification when this happens, so we know to create new, replacement connections (to a read-write host).\r\n\r\nThis addresses the one code path where this wasn't happening.  in addition, it adds logging to trace when the validation query was successfully initialized, just in case the code we believe to be executing is not in fact.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-17T18:53:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T17:11:00Z","closed_at":"2022-05-26T17:11:00Z","merged_at":"2022-05-26T17:11:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"fcb477f16bce98bdc4445edfbad89337315a014c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/03be39e1283de1a666374173e501120e84d49dab","head":{"label":"phet:completeUseOfDataSourceValidationQuery","ref":"completeUseOfDataSourceValidationQuery","sha":"03be39e1283de1a666374173e501120e84d49dab","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1639\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nFor Adhoc flows in GaaS, metrics are still being emitted on the Gobblin pipeline. This will use the adhoc configuration to determine whether or not to emit these metrics.\r\n\r\nFor non-GaaS initiated pipelines (will be controlled by a configuration key) there will be no naming changes\r\nFor GaaS pipelines they will use the naming convention `GobblinService.<FlowGroup>.<FlowName>.<EdgeId>.<MetricName>` so that they can be grouped together with the flow compilation status and the running status of these flows\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1638\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nSending a client request to Azkaban can sometimes lead to a TimeoutException. This TimeoutException handled by the guava retrying library wraps it in a different exception for some reason unlike other exceptions, so needs special handling. https://github.com/rholder/guava-retrying/issues/29\r\nUpon further inspection on Azkaban even if the request times out the job can still be running on the executor, so it's unsafe to force the request to retry; there needs to be special handling/checking around timeouts before retrying to not duplicate jobs and overload Azkaban.\r\n\r\nThe timeout can lead to the thread terminating early before the accounting is done to increment the running counts. So the solution here would be to increment the count before the Azkaban flow is sent, so if the request fails then the decrement will occur naturally in the process event after the SLA is missed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1637\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n- Add info of which metadata writer failed in the failure events\r\n- Add which operation type failed. To do this, split up the events so that there's a separate event if opType changes, otherwise the event offset ranges could contain multiple different offsets\r\n- Add which partition values were intended to be added/dropped as part of these GMCE. To do this added a `HiveMetadataWriterWithPartitionInfoException.java` only thrown from hive writer in order to pass partition info back to MCE Writer\r\n- Fix bug in hive metadata writer where failure in flush would throw RuntimeException, but catch block only catches IOException so fault tolerant behaviour would never work for flush failures\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in test pipeline\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1636\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDatasetCleaner internally launches the clean tasks for each version of the dataset in an ExecutorService and then waits for the tasks to get completed in the close() method but since DatasetCleanerTask never invokes close() soWe observed that the Gobblin tasks and Job finish early and don’t wait for all the dataset versions to get deleted successfully. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.
