Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-22T03:29:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-22T10:28:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-22T10:28:39Z","merged_at":"2019-12-22T10:28:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e9517dc2fb2892a256b8e2a0eaaadb9164b8b61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/65e355cc73f2c39ea17d90d7606d5c7e82079599","head":{"label":"kun-song:enhance-code","ref":"enhance-code","sha":"65e355cc73f2c39ea17d90d7606d5c7e82079599","user":{"login":"kun-song","id":4010735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTA3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4010735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song","html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131380726,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEzODA3MjY=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"kun-song/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kun-song","id":4010735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTA3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4010735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song","html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kun-song/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kun-song/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-20T07:11:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-21T05:34:09Z","closed_at":"2019-12-21T05:33:40Z","merged_at":"2019-12-21T05:33:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"93f21c1797991112084c352b55b00aa9063c6383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6a00a1a22698ee28e60a92beb5a2ddd3feae9a0a","head":{"label":"LiosWong:master","ref":"master","sha":"6a00a1a22698ee28e60a92beb5a2ddd3feae9a0a","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4d6639e2ead5195a093a6b16f65140e20c7c4cb9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

changelog\r\n `org.apache.dubbo.validation.support.jvalidation.JValidator`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\npass the `JValidatorTest`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-19T03:37:54Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T02:35:59Z","closed_at":"2019-12-20T05:18:14Z","merged_at":"2019-12-20T05:18:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d6639e2ead5195a093a6b16f65140e20c7c4cb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/851f4c5f42673b631a8a6fcfc64f82e3910f0161","head":{"label":"GungnirLaevatain:polish","ref":"polish","sha":"851f4c5f42673b631a8a6fcfc64f82e3910f0161","user":{"login":"GungnirLaevatain","id":18031800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMxODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18031800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain","html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227025449,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjcwMjU0NDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"GungnirLaevatain/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GungnirLaevatain","id":18031800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMxODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18031800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain","html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain/dubbo","description":"Apache

guys, how are you?\r\n\r\nI found a refactoring opportunity on Dubbo and would like to share with you.\r\n\r\nThe completeCompoundConfigs () method is almost duplicated in the ReferenceConfigBase and ServiceConfigBase classes. As most of the attributes used by this method belong to the AbstractInterfaceConfig class, my suggestion is pull up the completeCompoundConfigs () method to the AbstractInterfaceConfig class.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are duplicate code removal and the removal of a feature envy (this method has many calls to the super class).

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-18T02:44:42Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T02:28:05Z","closed_at":"2019-12-19T02:28:05Z","merged_at":"2019-12-19T02:28:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3d74c30a821768543d482eb239651c127a6887b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5501/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5501/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5501/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/588fbe4cc874d5cbffad079e4c948cf53fcf8cc3","head":{"label":"LiosWong:fix-some-typos","ref":"fix-some-typos","sha":"588fbe4cc874d5cbffad079e4c948cf53fcf8cc3","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f89a1a8dadb419a06494433ed53b9a35f69c36dc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-16T15:43:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T09:41:08Z","closed_at":"2019-12-20T09:41:07Z","merged_at":"2019-12-20T09:41:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"0227fda49ae92a60a66a5f02dc915e32fcc0512f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5492/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5492/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5492/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6e8122755c5cebe144f9eafbecfdc5a6d77e741b","head":{"label":"LinShunKang:performance/reduce_object_allocation_v2","ref":"performance/reduce_object_allocation_v2","sha":"6e8122755c5cebe144f9eafbecfdc5a6d77e741b","user":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222932918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI5MzI5MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LinShunKang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang/dubbo","description":"Apache

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-16T02:23:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-16T04:10:46Z","closed_at":"2019-12-16T03:55:52Z","merged_at":"2019-12-16T03:55:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2c772e1a13fd95c2b53728e5cd6e45d9a3a8ae6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b0240225f14457c01a8d2a30d0bee606fde9fb29","head":{"label":"LiosWong:fix-typo-5487","ref":"fix-typo-5487","sha":"b0240225f14457c01a8d2a30d0bee606fde9fb29","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"839d2a604e629ea9e96b964be09ae221e85312ba","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #5477 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-13T05:58:10Z","updated_at":"2019-12-14T11:29:35Z","closed_at":"2019-12-14T11:29:35Z","merged_at":"2019-12-14T11:29:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"839d2a604e629ea9e96b964be09ae221e85312ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9e291af4da1d5d357e5ab67cbca70e6c397cb932","head":{"label":"LiosWong:fix-typo","ref":"fix-typo","sha":"9e291af4da1d5d357e5ab67cbca70e6c397cb932","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"00febe9e3cb450737d403a937322dc08ab5c6f2a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-12T05:42:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T06:08:43Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T06:08:43Z","merged_at":"2019-12-12T06:08:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f7e07fb174d204cf4b3ef05cd27f40cef2faea0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/adce84698b92e5468f54a5bc1589dd1d54679bf7","head":{"label":"LiosWong:fix-typo-5466","ref":"fix-typo-5466","sha":"adce84698b92e5468f54a5bc1589dd1d54679bf7","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"938a46641ce76df26a01d5f7543b474219c78240","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5458) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-11T10:43:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T02:41:54Z","closed_at":"2019-12-13T02:41:54Z","merged_at":"2019-12-13T02:41:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"0948135e7ba9c7a85d9789a95df106c3a4617c83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2383b8a03082fc348e5002b6096c54060c3c01cd","head":{"label":"LinShunKang:fix/stringutils_split","ref":"fix/stringutils_split","sha":"2383b8a03082fc348e5002b6096c54060c3c01cd","user":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222932918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI5MzI5MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LinShunKang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-11T10:18:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T12:24:37Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T12:24:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca291b01c82fd8a61b7582345f9e4b4e43bfe42d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64b432f0d20cb436b3cca80d2c312ef2c1980a73","head":{"label":"MistRay:master","ref":"master","sha":"64b432f0d20cb436b3cca80d2c312ef2c1980a73","user":{"login":"MistRay","id":34370155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcwMTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34370155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay","html_url":"https://github.com/MistRay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227316910,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjczMTY5MTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"MistRay/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MistRay","id":34370155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcwMTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34370155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay","html_url":"https://github.com/MistRay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MistRay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MistRay/dubbo","description":"Apache

or other extended operations\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n**org.apache.dubbo.config.spring.beans.factory.annotation.ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor**\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\npass **ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessorTest**\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-11T06:31:22Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T09:16:34Z","closed_at":"2020-02-06T09:16:34Z","merged_at":"2020-02-06T09:16:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"027c5a6c2d092f7349bd0a9b21c81d788038494e","assignee":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need

log and comments have been changed.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

**org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.StringUtilsTest#testParseParameters**\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-10T05:49:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-10T12:37:18Z","closed_at":"2019-12-10T10:58:30Z","merged_at":"2019-12-10T10:58:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ebbeab31d161948263349a8df8a7880a4ecea78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/29","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/29","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/29/labels","id":4532061,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDUzMjA2MQ==","number":29,"title":"2.7.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":94,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-07-30T05:42:37Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T03:10:50Z","due_on":"2019-11-30T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T03:10:50Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cc05bada644616e9f8a13d5cfbe01193fa97a0e8","head":{"label":"GungnirLaevatain:polish","ref":"polish","sha":"cc05bada644616e9f8a13d5cfbe01193fa97a0e8","user":{"login":"GungnirLaevatain","id":18031800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMxODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18031800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain","html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227025449,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjcwMjU0NDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"GungnirLaevatain/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GungnirLaevatain","id":18031800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMxODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18031800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain","html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n修复应用路由不生效问题 #4779 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAppRouter 读取路径是以consumer application name 为基础的（consumer.condition-router），但是dubbo-admin写入是以provider application name 为基础 (provider.condition-router) 所以在注册的时候读取不到admin设置的应用路由条件 现在修复为 注册的时候通过 provider application name 读取， 可以正常工作。\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nexample https://github.com/challengeof/dubbo-demo\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-06T02:32:49Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T09:01:56Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T09:01:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e205d3d49f169a3834e95d2e8fa8326fb754e8e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fedf65b61aac589d899573c766f443a73677e330","head":{"label":"challengeof:master","ref":"master","sha":"fedf65b61aac589d899573c766f443a73677e330","user":{"login":"challengeof","id":11530876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMwODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11530876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof","html_url":"https://github.com/challengeof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":225603211,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjU2MDMyMTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"challengeof/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"challengeof","id":11530876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMwODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11530876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof","html_url":"https://github.com/challengeof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/challengeof/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Reduce object allocation:\r\n   - Reduce `Iterator` instance allocation when get `MethodDescriptor` in `ServiceDescriptor`.\r\n   - Reduce `StringBuilder` instance allocation  and memory copy in `DecodeableRpcResult.decode()` and `DubboMonitor.send()`.\r\n\r\n* Optimizing `String` usage for `URL` and `UrlUtils`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Use `Map<String, List<MethodDescriptor>>` rather than `Map<String, Set<MethodDescriptor>>` to store `methods`\r\n* Add `Logger.isDebugEnabled()` before invoke `Logger.debug()` in `DecodeableRpcResult.decode()`\r\n* Use `String.indexOf(char)` instead of `String.indexOf(String)` for single character string.\r\n* Use `String.indexOf(char)` instead of `String.contains(String)` for single character string.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Reduce object allocation:\r\n   - Reduce `Iterator` instance allocation when get `MethodDescriptor` in `ServiceDescriptor`.\r\n   - Reduce `StringBuilder` instance allocation  and memory copy in `DecodeableRpcResult.decode()` and `DubboMonitor.send()`.\r\n\r\n* Optimizing `String` usage for `URL` and `UrlUtils`.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Use `Map<String, List<MethodDescriptor>>` rather than `Map<String, Set<MethodDescriptor>>` to store `methods`\r\n* Add `Logger.isDebugEnabled()` before invoke `Logger.debug()` in `DecodeableRpcResult.decode()`\r\n* Use `String.indexOf(char)` instead of `String.indexOf(String)` for single character string.\r\n* Use `String.indexOf(char)` instead of `String.contains(String)` for single character string.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

effect\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixed the router problem of application condition router does not take effect #4779 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nApprouter uses the consumer application name as the path when it reads the condition rule but the provider application name as the path when dubbo-admin writes it and I've changed the way approuter reads it and now it works\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI did enough testing \r\nNot enough time to write unit tests \r\nI wrote the sample https://github.com/challengeof/dubbo-demo.git\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T12:19:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T02:13:48Z","closed_at":"2019-12-06T02:13:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c64b3e309349315ca0b1918e64513ed22573a0bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/738ee6037d900b77f3dc2752f9f1b1def1146200","head":{"label":"challengeof:master","ref":"master","sha":"738ee6037d900b77f3dc2752f9f1b1def1146200","user":{"login":"challengeof","id":11530876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMwODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11530876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof","html_url":"https://github.com/challengeof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":225603211,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjU2MDMyMTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"challengeof/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"challengeof","id":11530876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMwODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11530876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof","html_url":"https://github.com/challengeof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/challengeof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/challengeof/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1.Some UTs need docker, we should provider `-DnoDocker=true` to skip these tests.\r\n\r\n2.Download consul from 'https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/' will be very slow, we should provider `-DnoConsul=true` to skip these consul tests.\r\n\r\n3.We should provider `-DnoProtobuf=true` to skip downloading and installing protoc-gen-dubbo-java.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\ndubbo-configcenter/dubbo-configcenter-etcd/pom.xml\r\ndubbo-metadata/dubbo-metadata-report-etcd/pom.xml\r\ndubbo-registry/dubbo-registry-consul/pom.xml\r\ndubbo-remoting/dubbo-remoting-etcd3/pom.xml\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T11:08:18Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T10:24:06Z","closed_at":"2020-01-09T10:24:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7dfb2e7042c4ad88f842b6562cbd9aa6c5c33939","assignee":{"login":"hengyunabc","id":1683936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1683936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc","html_url":"https://github.com/hengyunabc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"hengyunabc","id":1683936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1683936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc","html_url":"https://github.com/hengyunabc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nuse StringUtils and CollectionUtils method in AbstractRegistry.java\r\n make code clean and simple\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-02T09:02:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T06:35:59Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T06:35:59Z","merged_at":"2019-12-11T06:35:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ebc217e9dc9ee23cdceb85398742b6f7f6509a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/52bad17ef4ad928df26ef9318e289fd5b4a15cb9","head":{"label":"AlexRenCN:191202-fromAlex","ref":"191202-fromAlex","sha":"52bad17ef4ad928df26ef9318e289fd5b4a15cb9","user":{"login":"AlexRenCN","id":26643176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQzMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26643176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexRenCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224789510,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQ3ODk1MTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlexRenCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlexRenCN","id":26643176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjQzMTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26643176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexRenCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexRenCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlexRenCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen a dubbo method call throw an custom exception, eg MyBizException, http protocol will output something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":\"1\",\"error\":{\"code\":0,\"message\":\"This is custom Msg: Wrong Param\",\"data\":{\"exceptionTypeName\":\"com.demo.exception.MyBizException\",\"message\":\"This is custom Msg: Wrong Param\"}}}\r\n``` \r\nI can't specific the error.code value, it is always zero. So I open this pull request to custom exception error code.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nadd support: Custom exception error code for http protocol\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. create an example dubbo project, throw an exception which implements HttpProtocolErrorCode which return an error code like 80024\r\n2. invoke dubbo by postman, assert the error.code value is 80024 as you set at the first step.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-01T03:44:08Z","updated_at":"2019-12-01T03:44:16Z","closed_at":"2019-12-01T03:44:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bea7ced350374e4a2f99e49a884f5984858b0a58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5406/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5406/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5406/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8d2f8566b6c63af79b8b573cd865bfbfc9baf13a","head":{"label":"gongxihai22:master","ref":"master","sha":"8d2f8566b6c63af79b8b573cd865bfbfc9baf13a","user":{"login":"gongxihai22","id":12083233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12083233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22","html_url":"https://github.com/gongxihai22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":135226250,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzUyMjYyNTA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"gongxihai22/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gongxihai22","id":12083233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDgzMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12083233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22","html_url":"https://github.com/gongxihai22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gongxihai22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gongxihai22/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nreslove project maven dependency issue;\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nNow in the maven Central Repository doesn't has alibaba_spring_context_support 1.0.4-SNAPSHOT dependency,  so we need update alibaba_spring_context_support_version to 1.0.5 to reslove maven dependency issue;\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSimplify the code fragment like follow\r\n```java\r\nV value = map.get(key);\r\nif( value == null ){\r\n    map.putIfAbsent(key, newValue);\r\n    value = map.get(key);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nreplaced by `Map#computeIfAbsent`.\r\n\r\nAnd also important, `Map#computeIfAbsent` is atomic while `Map#putIfAbsent` together with `Map#get` are not.\r\nThe `value` still can be null in a concurrent condition.\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-22T15:41:17Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T12:24:01Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T12:24:01Z","merged_at":"2019-12-11T12:24:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"7987100cad797ae82394ae88c87bac43a93ccf40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-20T10:09:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T12:29:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T12:29:39Z","merged_at":"2019-12-11T12:29:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"e31fd26f2c95e4cb8a14774ed6df7b1c3514f6ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a7e76b5a746a8d49c0e9df32208f24b06b3a56eb","head":{"label":"896938034:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"a7e76b5a746a8d49c0e9df32208f24b06b3a56eb","user":{"login":"896938034","id":26057188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26057188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034","html_url":"https://github.com/896938034","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222907534,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI5MDc1MzQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"896938034/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"896938034","id":26057188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26057188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034","html_url":"https://github.com/896938034","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/896938034/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/896938034/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-19T07:06:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T08:54:12Z","closed_at":"2020-02-01T06:58:09Z","merged_at":"2020-02-01T06:58:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed7be11af9a8a9dddb4d23eea089f3890391575b","assignee":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"qinliujie","id":8599441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8599441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie","html_url":"https://github.com/qinliujie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-19T06:17:38Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T03:17:13Z","closed_at":"2019-12-18T03:16:05Z","merged_at":"2019-12-18T03:16:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4d016b605c04d3aa911b31cd90fae768e3c5ecb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5352/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5352/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5352/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6024085545344479c893f4560be1b46ae9a9ee21","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:optimize_1","ref":"optimize_1","sha":"6024085545344479c893f4560be1b46ae9a9ee21","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

unstable under multiple network adapters.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nMake it stable.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2019-11-11T09:05:15Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T07:11:14Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T05:56:13Z","merged_at":"2019-11-18T05:56:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"c42b0a8cb23be43e159a9f6256eb889e026d54f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5303/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5303/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5303/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e4aef17f587439fe080503e5faf4bca6db3317e4","head":{"label":"jasonjoo2010:unstable-unit-tests","ref":"unstable-unit-tests","sha":"e4aef17f587439fe080503e5faf4bca6db3317e4","user":{"login":"jasonjoo2010","id":17573073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTczMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17573073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141798980,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE3OTg5ODA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"jasonjoo2010/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jasonjoo2010","id":17573073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTczMDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17573073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonjoo2010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jasonjoo2010/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes #5257\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nApollo namespaces won't end with file formats, e.g. `.properties`, `.yaml`, so we could safely trim them(and we'd better do that) before passing to methods like `ConfigService.getConfigFile(key, ConfigFileFormat.Properties)`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPassing `dubbo.properties` as key to `org.apache.dubbo.configcenter.support.apollo.ApolloDynamicConfiguration#getProperties` will return the configurations of namespace `dubbo` with format `properties`.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCI pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`.
