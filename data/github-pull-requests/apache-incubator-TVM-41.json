PR introduces a clone function for each of the task-level MetaSchedule classes for convenient class deep copying.\r\nTh reason we want to introduce the clone function is for convenient generation of tasks, i.e., instead of creating a class generation lambda function in tuning api we can supply some example classes, i.e., `ScheduleRule` and clone them. In most cases the tasks share the same type of the classes except IRModule, yet we allow customization of the classes.\r\n\r\n- [x] ScheduleRule\r\n- [x] Postproc\r\n- [x] Mutator\r\n- [x]

PR fixes issue https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/12763, where some OP are marked to keep the original dtype but some of its input is `bfloat16` while a `Cast` is missing.\r\nThe AMP tests have also been refined to cover `bfloat16` **without** accuracy checking.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nThe accuracy checking in `test_dnnl.py` of bf16 vs fp32 is unstable and error-prone. Thus the accuracy checking is ignored if only one bf16 result present, i.e. only compare bf16 vs bf16 and fp32 vs fp32.","created_at":"2022-09-15T01:21:00Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T09:42:33Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T09:42:33Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T09:42:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c9066d816408bd2858c9758b0865ca08112c78f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9ea7b7e32b1e3d7abe8daae8524e81afa886a2b2","head":{"label":"yangulei:fix_amp","ref":"fix_amp","sha":"9ea7b7e32b1e3d7abe8daae8524e81afa886a2b2","user":{"login":"yangulei","id":24203353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjAzMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24203353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei","html_url":"https://github.com/yangulei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":425653971,"node_id":"R_kgDOGV720w","name":"tvm","full_name":"yangulei/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangulei","id":24203353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjAzMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24203353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei","html_url":"https://github.com/yangulei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangulei/tvm","description":"Open

a 2-stage pipeline (DMA, compute) by lowering Async TIR primitives (see [RFC](https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0077-async-pipeline.md)) with memory copy semantics to builtin functions for DMA `Copy` and `Wait`.  These builtins can then be lowered through the device API, with example lowering on Hexagon to the `HexagonUserDMA` class. The example test case contained in this PR creates a 2 stage pipeline which lowers to the following TIR which is built and run on

`SKIPPED`.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-14T18:28:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T13:17:04Z","closed_at":"2022-09-16T22:01:11Z","merged_at":"2022-09-16T22:01:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"aded9d43ba1e798031900911cca4613487db84fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1862459d464e6b915602ab0be20b9684378b0e41","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:cuda_compute_decorator","ref":"cuda_compute_decorator","sha":"1862459d464e6b915602ab0be20b9684378b0e41","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

there~ the change try fix an issue due to #12515.\r\n\r\nPreviously the logic for `-2147483648` is  `parse(-literal)` = `-parse(literal)`, and all integer literals are converted to i32 (either the literal value actually overflow or not). \r\n\r\nSince after #12515, parse `2147483648` results to an i64 typed integer rather than i32, `-2147483648` then becomes to one i64 integer too, which is not

to issue https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/10211. The CSE pass can't handle commutativity because the arith system may not be able to do the commutativity。\r\n\r\nThe determination of the equality of two expressions (PrimExpr) is to use the method of structured determination, that is, to traverse the hierarchical structure of the two expressions, and to judge while traversing, if the structures of the two expressions are the same, and the smallest If the child nodes (nodes that cannot be traversed, generally such as Var) are the same, the expressions are considered to be the same.\r\n\r\nBefore performing PrimExpr comparison, a series of rewrite rules will be used to rewrite expressions to solve some operational problems, such as x * y + x * z will be rewritten as x * (y + z), so that to deal with distributivity.\r\nHowever, commutativity cannot be rewritten due to the characteristics of rewrite (it will fall into an infinite loop). This makes it impossible to compare the equality of some expressions, such as a * b *c != a * c * b, (a * b) * c != a * (b * c).\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, one solution is to sort and rewrite the expressions according to the `StructuralHash` of the Var nodes in the expressions before comparing the expressions. If two expressions are equivalent if they satisfy the commutativity, then they will definitely produce equivalent expressions of the same structure after sorting.\r\n\r\nUnder the assumption that the two expressions have the same structure, the determination condition that the two expressions satisfying the commutativity are the same can be further refined to the same set of all elements in the sub-expressions satisfying the commutativity. The sub-expressions satisfying the commutativity in the expression can be grasped by constructing the expression syntax tree. The sub-expressions satisfying the commutativity are the sub-trees of the expression tree whose child nodes are identical (the child nodes are OP).\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n```\r\n    Var： a, b, c, d, e\r\n\r\n    StructuralHash(a > b >c >d > e)\r\n\r\n    cse_var_1  = a * b *c + d + e\r\n\r\n    cse_var_2 = b * a * c + e + d\r\n```\r\nSort and rewrite cse_var_1 and cse_var_2, first extract their first subexpressions a * b *c and b * a * c, and rewrite them as a * b * c, and then extract the sub-expressions again ( a * b *c) + d + e and (a *b * c) + e + d, rewriting the sort as (a * b *c) + d + e, get the same expression.\r\n\r\ncc @masahi @Hzfengsy @tqchen @FranckQC

pass `PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation` seems to have problem when the buffer accessed indices take a loop carried dependency. As an example,\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef test(A: T.Buffer[(8, 8), \"int32\"], B: T.Buffer[(8, 8), \"int32\"]):\r\n    C = T.alloc_buffer([8, 8], \"int32\")\r\n    for i in range(8):\r\n        for j in range(8):\r\n            with T.block(\"b0\"):\r\n                vi = T.axis.spatial(8, i)\r\n                vj = T.axis.spatial(8, j)\r\n                C[vi, vj] = A[vi, vj] + vi\r\n        for j in range(8):\r\n            with T.block(\"b1\"):\r\n                vi = T.axis.opaque(8, i)\r\n                vj = T.axis.spatial(8, j)\r\n                B[vi, vj] = C[vi, vj] + T.if_then_else(vi > 0, C[vi - 1, vj], vi, dtype=\"int32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe block `b1`'s read access to intermediate buffer `C` on iteration `i`, depends `b0` write of `C` on both `i` and `i-1`, thus we should not put allocation of `C` under loop `i`, which is the LCA position of current plan strategy.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue we change the behavior of `DetectBufferLCA` to be aware of opaque block iters (loop carried dependency and other more complex behaviors are categorized as `opaque` in iter type annotation).\r\n\r\nIt enforce that every legal \"ancestor\" of buffer accesses should dominate all loops relates to accessed opaque block iters within buffer indices. Eg, since `vi` is opaque, buffer `C` indices use `vi`, the loop `i` must be under the planned allocation point of `C`.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting workload related to loop carried dependency, refer to https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-introducing-a-rolling-buffer-scheduling-primitive/9836, where the intermediate result of previous iteration is try best to get reused.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

Description\r\nThis PR adds TF [Bincount](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/Bincount) support. \r\n\r\nRecently [DenseBincount support](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12728) was added. Both `raw_ops.Bincount` and `raw_ops.DenseBincount` are used by `tf.math.bincount()` . One or another raw_op is used depending on the `tf.math.bincount()` parameters.\r\n\r\n#### Limitations:\r\n- Requires `relay.vm.compile` because internal data structures shapes depend on the input data content.\r\n\r\n#### Known issues:\r\n- Input array should not contain numbers outside of the range `[0, size-1]`. TVM `scatter_add` counts such values, but TF `DenseBincount` ignores them.\r\n- using `tf.math.bincount()` with `weights` and `axis=None` requires operator `UnsortedSegmentSum` to be implemented.\r\n\r\n@masahi

It is used for computation in Einsum pattern specifically, which cover most cases for tensorization. Different from general cases for padding in https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0077-layout-transform-padding.md, this primitive pads the output blocks and the input blocks at once, which eliminates the need to extra arithmetic analysis to provide the guarantee of program correctness.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @wrongtest-intellif @spectrometerHBH @Lunderberg

Description\r\nThis PR adds TF [DenseBincount](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc/class/tensorflow/ops/dense-bincount) support. The code was inspired by TVM [pytorch.py bincount impl](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py#L2526).\r\n\r\n#### Limitations:\r\n- Requires `relay.vm.compile` because internal data structures shapes depend on the input data content.\r\n\r\n#### Known issues:\r\n- Input array should not contain numbers outside of the range `[0, size-1]`. TVM `scatter_add` counts such values, but TF `DenseBincount` ignores them.\r\n\r\n@masahi

it was ambiguous whether `BlockNode::iter_vars` were in-scope for `BlockRealizeNode::predicate`.  `ConvertBlocksToOpaque` treated them as in-scope, and applied a mapping from `iter_vars` to `iter_values`.  Similarly, TVMScript printing places `T.where` statements below the `T.axis` statements, where `T.axis` definitions are in scope.  However, `BlockRealizeNode::SEqualReduce` and `BlockRealizeNode::SHashReduce` do not visit the block and `iter_vars` until after visiting the predicate, placing the `iter_vars` out of scope.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the printing of `T.where` to be above `T.axis`, and updates `ConvertBlocksToOpaque` to report an error if the predicate contains references to `BlockNode::iter_vars`.  After this commit, these three usages all consistently treat\r\n`BlockNode::iter_vars` as out of scope for `BlockRealizeNode::predicate`.\n\ncc @Hzfengsy

lowering a non-opaque TIR block to an opaque block in `tir.transform.ConvertBlocksToOpaque`, the iter vars in BlockNode::iter_vars` are replaced by their values in `BlockRealizeNode::iter_values` wherever they occur in `BlockRealize`. However, prior to this commit, the `BlockRealizeNode::predicate` was visited before the variable definition of `BlockNode::iter_vars`.  As a result, StructuralHash and StructuralEqual would treat any occurrences as undefined variables, which is inconsistent with how they are handled in `ConvertBlocksToOpaque`.\r\n\r\nThis commit

case of quantized models nn.pad operation typically is not fused with QNN ops and lives as a standalone operation. In this case it uses default injective schedule for Hexagon target and it is not optimized very well for some shapes/layouts (based on analysis of real models like ResNet50 INT8).\r\n\r\n**What was done:**\r\nNew schedule for Pad operation was implemented instead of default injective schedule. For Hexagon target injective schedule does fusion of all axis and vectorization on 128/64/32 (depends on dtype). It works fine for Add, Sub, etc... but not for Pad. New optimized schedule does these steps (fusion+vectorization) only if last tensor dimension is divisible by 128/64/32 (depends on dtype). It was done only for Hexagon, for other targets (x86, cuda, etc.) there is no changes and it uses default injective schedule.\r\n\r\n**Benchmark results on Snapdragon 888:**\r\n\r\n4d NHWC layout with

executing `tvmc run module.tar` will run the input model twice. For benchmaking this is to be expected as the first run is used to prime caches etc before taking a measurement. However, this seems a bit unintuitive to have as default, especially when benchmarking is not always intended. In this sense, this commit aims to amend the number of runs for the default: `tvmc run module.tar` to a single run.\r\n\r\nAfter inspection, this seems to be down to the use of the `.benchmark()` method which runs (1 + repeat * number) executions in total. This means that at least two runs are required (i.e. when repeat=1, number=1). It also seems that it is only necessary to benchmark the model when `--print-time` has been set from the CLI POV. From the python interface POV, benchmarking is always run, but this may not always be necessary.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes use of the `.run()` method to singularly execute the model by default. From the CLI this will be used when `--print-time` is set to False whereas from the python interface this will be used when `benchmark=False`. Otherwise, the `.benchmark()` method will be used as before. Complementary to this change `repeat`, `number` and `end_to_end` parameters are only used when either `--print-time` or `benchmark` are set to True - and the documentation has been updated to indicate this.\r\n\r\ncc @Mousius @gromero @leandron @jwfromm @tkonolige

Currently, `StructuralEqual/Hash` take into account NDArray raw data to determine equality / compute hash. This is problematic for `link-params = True` case, because meta schedule task extraction and database look up will treat the following subgraphs as distinct, even though the only difference is the content of NDArray constants. \r\n```\r\ndef @fused_nn.conv2d_add(%p0: Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] */, Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), fl\r\noat32] {                                                                                                                      \r\n  %0 = nn.conv2d(%p0, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(3, 3, 256, 256), float32] */, padding=[1, 1, 1, 1], channels=256, kernel_size=[3, 3], data_\r\nlayout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWIO\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] */;                                                                       \r\n  add(%0, meta[relay.Constant][1] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1, 1, 256), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] */        \r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @fused_nn.conv2d_add(%p0: Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] */, Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), fl\r\noat32] {                                                                                                                      \r\n  %0 = nn.conv2d(%p0, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(3, 3, 256, 256), float32] */, padding=[1, 1, 1, 1], channels=256, kernel_size=[3, 3], data_\r\nlayout=\"NHWC\", kernel_layout=\"HWIO\") /* ty=Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] */;                                                                       \r\n  add(%0, meta[relay.Constant][1] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1, 1, 256), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 32, 32, 256), float32] */  \r\n} \r\n```  \r\n\r\nThis PR adds options to `StructuralEqual/Hash` to allow ignoring NDArray raw data when comparing / hashing.

For mappings that return the same type, this is done by delegating to `Array::MutateByApply`, to take advantage of the same copy-on-write behavior.\r\n\r\nFor ease of review, this PR consists of two separate commits.  The first implements `Array::Map`, while the second performs several small

to this commit, the following code would compile and run without error.  This occurs because the typed `Array<T>::insert` calls the untyped `ArrayNode::InitRange`, with no type-checking done before the call.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nVar x(\"x\");\r\nVar y(\"y\");\r\nArray<Var> var_arr{x, y};\r\nArray<PrimExpr> expr_arr{x + 1, y + 2};\r\n// Erroneously inserts static-type PrimExpr, runtime-type Add, even\r\n// though neither PrimExpr is a type of Var.\r\nvar_arr.insert(var_arr.begin(), expr_arr.begin(), expr_arr.end());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this commit, a `static_assert` in `Array<T>::insert` and in `Array<T>::Array(IterType,IterTYpe)` restricts the iterators, such that they must dereference to `T`, `Optional<T>`, a subclass of `T`, or `Optional<U>` where `U` is a subclass of `T`.\r\n\r\nThe public method `ArrayNode::SetItem` exposes a similar issue.  In the future, we may want to make it be private, accessed only through type-safe method in `Array<T>::Set`.\n\ncc
