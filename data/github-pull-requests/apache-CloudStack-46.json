Conserve mode = false caused that L2 network offerings in a zone were not listed, as described in the issue below.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## GitHub Issue/PRs\r\nThis fixes the issue #2690 \r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nNo Conserve mode checkbox when L2 is selected:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/41046413-bc2cd1ee-6980-11e8-991f-8cb3e665b7bb.png)\r\nList zone L2 network offerings:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5295080/41046566-08ab2f16-6981-11e8-9ddc-b224a1294b2e.png)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nCreate an L2 network offering (check that Conserve mode checkbox is not visible).

Source NAT option on Private Gateway does not work\r\nThis fixes #2680 \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen you use the Source NAT feature of Private Gateways on a VPC.  This should Source NAT all traffic from CloudStack VMs going towards IPs reachable through Private Gateways.\r\n\r\nThis change in this PR, stops adding the Source CIDR to SNAT rules.  This should be discussed/reviewed, but i can see no reason why the Source CIDR is needed.  There can only be one SNAT IP per interface, except for Static (one-to-one) NATs, which still work with this change in place.  The outbound interface is what matters in the rule.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n##### SUMMARY\r\n<!-- Explain the problem/feature briefly -->\r\nThere is a bug in the Private Gateway functionality, when Source NAT is enabled for the Private Gateway.  When the SNAT is added to iptables, it has the source CIDR of the private gateway subnet.  Since no VMs live in that private gateway subnet, the SNAT doesn’t work.  \r\n\r\n##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE\r\n<!--\r\nFor bugs, show exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case. Use Screenshots if accurate.\r\n\r\nFor new features, show how the feature would be used.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->\r\nBelow is an example:\r\n\r\n- VMs have IP addresses in the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet.\r\n- The Private Gateway address is 10.101.141.2/30\r\n \r\nIn the outputs below, the SOURCE field for the new SNAT (eth3) only matches if the source is 10.101.141.0/30.  Since the VM has an IP address in 10.0.0.0/24, the VMs don’t get SNAT’d as they should when talking across the private gateway.

up in a new cluster (not if it is just started up on a new host in the same cluster).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nExample: A VM that uses managed storage is stopped. The VM is then started on a different host in the same cluster. The Start operation fails.\r\n\r\nTo get around this issue, you must either start the VM up on the same host or on a host in a different cluster.\r\n\r\nThe reason is due to a slightly erroneous check in VolumeOrchestrator.prepare.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, we should be checking if the cluster ID changes, not if the host ID changes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI noticed that I could not start a stopped VM that uses managed storage on a different host in the same cluster as the host it was originally running on.\r\n\r\nAfter I changed the code (this PR), I re-tested the scenario. I can now start the VM up on a different host in the same cluster as the host it was originally running on. Also, I can still start it up on the same host as it was originally running on or on a host in a different cluster.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Description\r\nIn 4.11.0, I added the ability to online migrate volumes from NFS to managed storage. This actually works for Ceph to managed storage in a private 4.8 branch, as well. I thought I had brought along all of the necessary code from that private 4.8 branch to make Ceph to managed storage functional in 4.11.0, but missed one piece (which is fixed by this PR).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

introduces a new global setting `vm.configdrive.primarypool.enabled` to toggle creation/hosting of config drive iso files on primary storage, the default will be `false` causing them to be hosted on secondary storage. The support is limited from hypervisor resource side and in current implementation limited to KVM. The next big change is that config drive is created at a temporary location by management server and shipped to either KVM or SSVM agent via cmd-answer pattern, the data of which is not logged in logs. This saves us from adding `genisoimage` dependency on cloudstack-agent pkg.\r\n\r\nThe APIs to reset ssh public key, password and user-data (via update VM API) requires that VM should be shutdown. Therefore, in the refactoring I removed the case of updation of existing ISO. If there are objections I'll re-put the strategy to detach+attach new config iso as a way of updation. In the refactored implementation, the folder name is changed to lower-cased `configdrive`. And during VM start, migration or shutdown/removal if primary storage is enable for use, the KVM agent will handle cleanup tasks otherwise SSVM agent will handle them. \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen configuring a pre-setup primary storage we can enter the name-label of the storage that is going to be used by ACS and is already set up in the host. The problem is that we can use any String of characters there, and this String does not need to be a UUID. When listing volumes from a primary storage that has such conditions, the list will return all of the volumes in the cloud because the “API framework” will ignore that value as it is not a UUID type.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

agent loses connection with management server, the reconnection\r\nlogic waits for any pending tasks to finish. However, when such tasks\r\ndo finish they fail to send an `Answer` back to managements server.\r\nTherefore from a management server's perspective such pending\r\noperations are stuck in a FSM state and need manual removal or fixing.\r\nThis is by design where management server's side cmd-answer request\r\npattern is code/execution dependent, therefore even if the answer\r\nwere to be sent when management server came back up (reconnects)\r\nthe management server will fail to acknowledge and process the answer\r\ndue to missing listeners or being in the exact state to handle answers.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the Agent would wait to reconnect until the internal\r\ntasks complete but I found no reason why it should wait for reconnection\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

When the job finishes, it fails to send answer. When mgmt server is started again, it has the snapshot still in backing state. However, the agent is blocked until the job finishes, even if the mgmt server were to come up online. Irrespective of the case, the pending job fails to reply (as the link object changes, the `send` fails).\r\n\r\nAfter fix: The same as above, but this time agent is not blocked by any long-running pending job and reconnects faster. The failure scenarios remain the same, including manual fixing (if any) needed after the mgmt server is back.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen the feature to enable disk offering replacement during volume migration was created, we were forcing the tags of the new disk offering to exact the same as the tags of the target storage poll. However, that is not how ACS manages volumes allocation. This change modifies this validation to make it consistent with volume allocation.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to make the validation consistent with the mechanism used to select a storage pool to deploy a volume when a virtual machine is deployed or when a new data disk is allocated.

When dhcp client discovery is made,\r\nthe `dhcp-server-identifier` contains the non VIP address that is\r\nused by password reset script to query guest VM password.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Verified on master VRs (and also on switching) that password server runs on the guest nic IP than the VIP and the password script is able to consume the nonVIP address from `dhcp-server-identifier`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.

deprecates the vmware.ports.per.dvportgroup global setting.\r\n\r\nThe vSphere Auto Expand feature (introduced in vSphere 5.0) will take\r\ncare of dynamically increasing/decreasing the dvPorts when running out\r\nof distributed ports . But in case of vSphere 4.1/4.0 (If used), as this\r\nfeature is not there, the new default value (=> 8) have an impact in the\r\nexisting deployments. Action item for vSphere 4.1/4.0: Admin should\r\nmodify the global configuration setting \"vmware.ports.per.dvportgroup\"\r\nfrom 8 to any number based on their environment because the proposal\r\ndefault value of 8 would be very less without auto expand feature in\r\ngeneral. The current default value of 256 may not need immediate\r\nmodification after deployment, but 8 would be very less which means\r\nadmin need to update immediately after upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis continues and take-over from PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1253\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nPrimary Storage count for an account does not decrease when a Data Disk is deleted\r\n\r\nWhen a data disk is created and not attached in a running VM, the \"deleteVolume\" will not decrement the count for used primary storage in the VMs accounting information. The property that is not being decremented is called \"primarystoragetotal\"; this information can be retrieved via \"listAccounts\" API method.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce this issue:\r\n1 - Create an account, deploy a VM in it\r\n2 - Check the primary storage count for the account with listAccounts API\r\n3 - Create a data disk and attach to a VM (either running or stopped)\r\n4 - Check the primary storage count for the account with listAccounts API\r\n5 - Delete the Data disk (you will need to detach the disk)\r\n6 - Check the primary storage count for the account with listAccounts API - It is decreasing twice the volume and primary storage counts.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThe present configdrive generation happens on secondary storage, which is also used in public facing functionality. For those that wnat it can be processed on primary storage.

`services/console-proxy-rdp/rdbconsole` under `services/console-proxy`\r\n- ~~Remove `services/iam` (as of ba848087f8) [open for discussion]~~\r\n  - ~~Removing the `iam` projects doesn't have any side effect, although there are lots of leftover tests~~\r\n- ~~Remove `tools/wix-cloudstack-maven-plugin`~~\r\n- Alphabetic order:\r\n  - version properties in parent pom\r\n  - dependencies in parent pom\r\n  - modules in `engine`\r\n  - modules in `framework`\r\n  - modules in `plugins`\r\n  - modules in `services`\r\n- Extract all dependency version and plugin version to properties of

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently, users are not able to change the disk offering of VMs' root volumes. It might be interesting to allow such changes, so users would be able to move a VM initially deployed in shared storage to local storage and vice versa. It is also interesting to enable changing the quality of service offered to root disks.\r\n\r\nWe are allowing only administrators to execute the change of root volumes disk offerings during volume migration between storage. Therefore, we perform all at once, the migration of storage and the disk offering to reflect the new place.\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of work #2486. After using that feature for a while we felt the need to change the disk offering of VM's root volume.\r\n\r\n### Extra details\r\nCompute offerings (system VM service offerings as well) are “linked”/bound to a disk offering. Therefore, each compute offering (are entries in the `service_offering` table) also has an entry in the disk_offering table. The idea is that when deploying a VM, you need some sort of disk_offering for the root volume. Then, you have some sort of default disk_offering that is bound to the compute offering used to deploy the VM.

Description\r\nThis PR adds an API call named `archiveSnapshot` which takes in a snapshot residing on primary storage and moves it to secondary storage. The main use case for this relates to the use in Managed storage where the storage supports native snapshots. Because of cost and availability reasons, it is useful to move snapshots that are taken on primary storage (native snapshots) to secondary storage. \r\n\r\nThe API takes in a `snapshotid` , creates a new snapshot on secondary storage and deletes the snapshot on primary storage. \r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis fixes a database error that occurs when upgrading from 4.5 to 4.11. A 'table already exists' SQL error is encountered during the upgrade.\r\nIf a table already exists in the database, it should only attempt to create a table if it does not exist.\r\nThe fix adds SQL syntax create a table only if not exists and also removes the drop table statements since there may be users that already have such a table with data in their database.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nExpected behaviour: when upgrading from an older version of cloudstack, it should upgrade the database without producing any SQL errors. Specifically, the SQL upgrade scripts should not attempt to create a table if it already exists. It should also not attempt to drop existing tables unless it is in the cleanup scripts. \r\nActual behaviour: a database error that occurs when upgrading from 4.5 to 4.11. A 'table already exists' SQL error is encountered during the upgrade.\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nNew API command to list the management servers, following the discussion on the mailing list. It adds back (I think it was removed at some point) the uuid column in the `mshost` table.

In this issue we post a patch which can add  !=null  based on existed !=null  check. For example:\r\n\r\nCallee GlobalLoadBalancingRulesServiceImpl#lookupGslbServiceProvider:\r\n```\r\nprotected GslbServiceProvider lookupGslbServiceProvider() {\r\n    return _gslbProviders.size() == 0 ? null : _gslbProviders.get(0);// may return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCaller GlobalLoadBalancingRulesServiceImpl#checkGslbServiceEnabledInZone have !=null:\r\n```\r\nprivate boolean checkGslbServiceEnabledInZone(long zoneId, long physicalNetworkId) {\r\n\r\n   GslbServiceProvider gslbProvider = lookupGslbServiceProvider();\r\n   if (gslbProvider == null) {\r\n      throw new CloudRuntimeException(\"No GSLB provider is available\");\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   return gslbProvider.isServiceEnabledInZone(zoneId, physicalNetworkId);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut another GlobalLoadBalancingRulesServiceImpl#applyGlobalLoadBalancerRuleConfig does not have !=null check:\r\n```\r\nGslbServiceProvider gslbProvider = lookupGslbServiceProvider();\r\nsiteLb.setGslbProviderPublicIp(gslbProvider.getZoneGslbProviderPublicIp(dataCenterId,physicalNetworkId));\r\n.........\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we will add below code in non-(!=null) caller GlobalLoadBalancingRulesServiceImpl#applyGlobalLoadBalancerRuleConfig\r\n```\r\nif (gslbProvider == null) {\r\n    throw new CloudRuntimeException(\"No GSLB provider is available\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut due to we are not very  familiar with CLOUDSTACK, hope some expert can review it.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-15T06:23:30Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T13:03:46Z","closed_at":"2018-04-26T13:03:46Z","merged_at":"2018-04-26T13:03:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c42aafae0d3286a38d796a7c69a6aec6810cf79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/4/labels","id":3009550,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAwOTU1MA==","number":4,"title":"4.12.0.0","description":"Milestone for PRs targetted for the next major 4.12.0.0 release.

To make it\r\npublicly accessible, I've a DO machine to which one of my machines does autossh\r\nand port forwards to it. The DO machine has apache2 running that reverse proxies\r\nto only certain paths on the forwarded port. The DO endpoint is secured by letsencrypt\r\ncerts. With this change, a user/admin will be able to run console proxy via a URL/domain\r\nbut on http instead of https internally. Externally, such as my setup, one can secure\r\nurls/paths using a single frontend machine.
