For example, timestamps after the epoch are truncated by cutting off the rest part of the timestamp:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('SECOND', '2020-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n2020-02-11 00:01:02\r\n```\r\nbut seconds in the truncated timestamp before the epoch are increased by 1:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('SECOND', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n1960-02-11 00:01:03\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above outputs correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('SECOND', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n1960-02-11 00:01:02\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the uploadBlockSync api in BlockTransferService always succeeds irrespective of whether the BlockManager was able to successfully replicate a block on peer block manager or not. This PR makes sure that the NettyBlockRpcServer invokes onFailure callback when it is not able to replicate the block to itself because of any reason. The onFailure callback makes sure that the BlockTransferService on client side gets the failure and retry replication the Block on some other BlockManager. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently the Spark Block replication retry logic is not working correctly. It doesn't retry on other Block managers even when replication fails on 1 of the peers.\r\n\r\nA user can cache an DataFrame with different replication factor. Ex - df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY_2) - This will cache each partition at two different BlockManagers. When a DataFrame partition is computed first time, it is firstly stored locally on the local BlockManager and then it is replicated to other block managers based on replication factor config. The replication of block to other block managers might fail because of memory/network etc issues and so there is already provision to retry the replication on some other peer based on \"spark.storage.maxReplicationFailures\" config, Currently when this replication fails, the client does not know about the failure and so it doesn't retry on other peers. This PR fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded Unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTable generated by `CREATE TABLE LIKE` a partitioned table is a partitioned table. But when run `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION`, it will throw `AnalysisException: ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION is not allowed`. That's because the default value of `tracksPartitionsInCatalog` from `CREATE TABLE LIKE` always is false.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up work for #27441. For the cases of new TimestampFormatter return null while legacy formatter can return a value, we need to throw an exception instead of silent change. The legacy config will be referenced in the error message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid silent result change for new behavior in 3.0. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, an exception is thrown when we detect legacy formatter can parse the string and the new formatter return null.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExtend existing UT.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-11T04:07:20Z","updated_at":"2020-04-10T07:51:31Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T07:30:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92fb3879233f8c142ac7ac7d7c85ed2b961524bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d01c7502ea7b4126bc6be362f1c2c20cebc5f288","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-30668-follow","ref":"SPARK-30668-follow","sha":"d01c7502ea7b4126bc6be362f1c2c20cebc5f288","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR sets orc's classifier to nohive, which has shaded hive-storage-api.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRight now, Hive 2.3 profile pulls in regular orc, which depends on hive-storage-api. However, hive-storage-api and hive-common have the following common class files\r\n\r\n```\r\norg/apache/hadoop/hive/common/ValidReadTxnList.class\r\norg/apache/hadoop/hive/common/ValidTxnList.class\r\norg/apache/hadoop/hive/common/ValidTxnList$RangeResponse.class\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/storage-release-2.6.0/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/common/ValidReadTxnList.java (pulled in by orc 1.5.8) and https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/release-2.3.6/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/common/ValidReadTxnList.java (from hive-common 2.3.6) both are in the classpath and they are different. Having both versions in the classpath can cause unexpected behavior due to classloading order. We should still use orc-nohive, which has hive-storage-api shaded.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-11T04:01:03Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T19:25:22Z","closed_at":"2020-03-04T19:25:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6721bd65f66b7c46f42b3753511d103e700b14bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5039ab4541bc337d263665093aee77c2fd6c035","head":{"label":"yhuai:SPARK-30784","ref":"SPARK-30784","sha":"a5039ab4541bc337d263665093aee77c2fd6c035","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":238792931,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzg3OTI5MzE=","name":"forked-apache-spark","full_name":"yhuai/forked-apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai/forked-apache-spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following refinements to the workflow for building docs:\r\n* Install Python and Ruby consistently using pyenv and rbenv across both the docs README and the release Dockerfile.\r\n* Pin the Python and Ruby versions we use.\r\n* Pin all direct Python and Ruby dependency versions.\r\n* Eliminate any use of `sudo pip`, which the Python community discourages, or `sudo gem`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR should increase the consistency and reproducibility of the doc-building process by managing Python and Ruby in a more consistent way, and by eliminating unused or outdated code.\r\n\r\nHere's a possible example of an issue building the docs that would be addressed by the changes in this PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27459#discussion_r376135719\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests:\r\n* I was able to build the Docker image successfully, minus the final part about `RUN useradd`.\r\n    * I am unable to run `do-release-docker.sh` because I am not a committer and don't have the required GPG key.\r\n* I built the docs locally and viewed them in the browser.\r\n\r\nI think I need a committer to more fully test out these changes.","created_at":"2020-02-10T23:05:30Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T04:19:02Z","closed_at":"2020-03-07T17:43:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a39d0bfb39c5875303a90bf2c6c8cb0ba208b910","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCUMENTATION","name":"DOCUMENTATION","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ebba66868f9833cbf2771476b609bfefaf8e946c","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-30731-building-docs","ref":"SPARK-30731-building-docs","sha":"ebba66868f9833cbf2771476b609bfefaf8e946c","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExclude hive-service-rpc from build. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhive-service-rpc 2.3.6 and spark sql's thrift server module have duplicate classes. Leaving hive-service-rpc 2.3.6 in the class path means that spark can pick up classes defined in hive instead of its thrift server module, which can cause hard to debug runtime errors due to class loading order and compilation errors for applications depend on spark.\r\n\r\n If you compare hive-service-rpc 2.3.6's jar (https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/hive/hive-service-rpc/2.3.6/hive-service-rpc-2.3.6.jar) and spark thrift server's jar (e.g. https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/spark/spark-hive-thriftserver_2.12/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/spark-hive-thriftserver_2.12-3.0.0-20200207.021914-364.jar), you will see that all of classes provided by hive-service-rpc-2.3.6.jar are covered by spark thrift server's jar. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30783 has output of jar tf for both jars.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-10T22:51:13Z","updated_at":"2020-02-11T17:48:24Z","closed_at":"2020-02-11T16:13:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f39cb6180bdca5ae1bd4b1fa4d64e55e120f6ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/678cf5a3c15f4f41a53593ef3489152a3d55f46b","head":{"label":"yhuai:SPARK-30783","ref":"SPARK-30783","sha":"678cf5a3c15f4f41a53593ef3489152a3d55f46b","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":238792931,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzg3OTI5MzE=","name":"forked-apache-spark","full_name":"yhuai/forked-apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai/forked-apache-spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to fix an issue where qualified columns are not matched for v2 tables if current catalog/namespace are used.\r\n\r\nFor v1 tables, you can currently perform the following:\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT default.t.id FROM t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor v2 tables, the following fails:\r\n```SQL\r\nUSE testcat.ns1.ns2;\r\nSELECT testcat.ns1.ns2.t.id FROM t;\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`testcat.ns1.ns2.t.id`' given input columns: [t.id, t.point]; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is a bug since qualified column names cannot match if current catalog/namespace are used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the following works:\r\n```SQL\r\nUSE testcat.ns1.ns2;\r\nSELECT testcat.ns1.ns2.t.id FROM t;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new

This PR makes an empty `LocalTableScanExec` return an `RDD` without partitions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is a bit unexpected that the RDD contains partitions if there is not work to do. It also can save a bit of work when this is used in a more complex plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test to `SparkPlanSuite`.","created_at":"2020-02-10T20:56:27Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T01:48:43Z","closed_at":"2020-02-12T01:48:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cfca56c80d1013db69156fd3e94f868527f5ceb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d46dec2061054da6b8c041b5649d0778d2e9471","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-30780","ref":"SPARK-30780","sha":"6d46dec2061054da6b8c041b5649d0778d2e9471","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Fix the scope of `Logging.initializeForcefully` so that it doesn't appear in subclasses' public methods. Right now, `sc.initializeForcefully(false, false)` is allowed to called.\r\n- Don't show classes under `org.apache.spark.internal` package in API docs.\r\n- Add missing `since` annotation.\r\n- Fix the scope of `ArrowUtils` to remove it from the API docs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid leaking APIs unintentionally in Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. All these changes are to avoid leaking APIs unintentionally in Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually generated the API docs and verified the above issues have been fixed.","created_at":"2020-02-10T19:19:08Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T23:14:13Z","closed_at":"2020-02-10T22:26:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36e257158207bb68030cd06d0247143f87e17901","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd FValueRegressionSelector for continuous features and continuous labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent Spark only supports the selection of categorical features, while there are many requirements for the selection of continuous distribution features.\r\n\r\nI will add two new selectors:\r\n\r\n1. FValueRegressionSelector for continuous features and continuous labels.\r\n2. ANOVAFValueClassificationSelector for continuous features and categorical labels.\r\n\r\nI will use subtasks to add these two selectors:\r\n1. add FValueRegressionSelector on scala side\r\n2. add FValueRegressionSelector on python side\r\n3. add samples and doc\r\n4. do the same for ANOVAFValueClassificationSelector\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nAdd a new Selector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe exception messages for dstream.py when using windows were improved to be specific about what sliding duration is important.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe batch interval of dstreams are improperly named as sliding windows. The term sliding window is also used to reference the new window of a dstream collected over a window of rdds in a parent dstream. We should probably fix the naming convention of sliding window used in the dstream class, but for now more this more explicit exception message may reduce confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt wasn't since this is only a change of the exception

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add legacy date/timestamp formatters based on `SimpleDateFormat` and `FastDateFormat`:\r\n- `LegacyFastTimestampFormatter` - uses `FastDateFormat` and supports parsing/formatting in microsecond precision. The code was borrowed from Spark 2.4, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26507 & https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26582\r\n- `LegacySimpleTimestampFormatter` uses `SimpleDateFormat`, and support the `lenient` mode. When the `lenient` parameter is set to `false`, the parser become much stronger in checking its input. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark 2.4.x uses the following parsers for parsing/formatting date/timestamp strings:\r\n- `DateTimeFormat` in CSV/JSON datasource\r\n- `SimpleDateFormat` - is used in JDBC datasource, in partitions parsing.\r\n- `SimpleDateFormat` in strong mode (`lenient = false`), see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.4/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/util/DateTimeUtils.scala#L124. It is used by the `date_format`, `from_unixtime`, `unix_timestamp` and `to_unix_timestamp` functions.\r\n\r\nThe PR aims to make Spark 3.0 compatible with Spark 2.4.x in all those cases when `spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled` is set to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis shouldn't change behavior with default settings. If `spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled` is set to `true`, users should observe behavior of Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Modified tests in `DateExpressionsSuite` to check the legacy parser - `SimpleDateFormat`.\r\n- Added `CSVLegacyTimeParserSuite` and `JsonLegacyTimeParserSuite` to run `CSVSuite` and `JsonSuite` with the legacy parser - `FastDateFormat`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, we add a parameter in the python function vector_to_array(col) that allows converting to a column of arrays of Float (32bits) in scala, which would be mapped to a numpy array of dtype=float32.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the downstream ML training, using float32 instead of float64 (default) would allow a larger batch size, i.e., allow more data to fit in the memory.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nOld: `vector_to_array()` only take one param\r\n```\r\ndf.select(vector_to_array(\"colA\"), ...)\r\n```\r\nNew: `vector_to_array()` can take an additional optional param: `dtype` = \"float32\" (or \"float64\")\r\n```\r\ndf.select(vector_to_array(\"colA\", \"float32\"), ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test in scala.\r\ndoctest in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis brings https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26324 back. It was reverted basically because, firstly Hive compatibility, and the lack of investigations in other DBMSes and ANSI.\r\n\r\n- In case of PostgreSQL seems coercing NULL literal to TEXT type.\r\n- Presto seems coercing `array() + array(1)` -> array of int.\r\n- Hive seems  `array() + array(1)` -> array of strings\r\n\r\n Given that, the design choices have been differently made for some reasons. If we pick one of both, seems coercing to array of int makes much more sense.\r\n\r\nAnother investigation was made offline internally. Seems ANSI SQL 2011, section 6.5 \"<contextually typed value specification>\" states:\r\n\r\n> If ES is specified, then let ET be the element type determined by the context in which ES appears. The declared type DT of ES is Case:\r\n>\r\n> a) If ES simply contains ARRAY, then ET ARRAY[0].\r\n>\r\n> b) If ES simply contains MULTISET, then ET MULTISET.\r\n>\r\n> ES is effectively replaced by CAST ( ES AS DT )\r\n\r\nFrom reading other related context, doing it to `NullType`. Given the investigation made, choosing to `null` seems correct, and we have a reference Presto now. Therefore, this PR proposes to bring it back.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen empty array is created, it should be declared as array<null>.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, `array()` creates `array<null>`. Now `array(1) + array()` can correctly create `array(1)` instead of `array(\"1\")`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually","created_at":"2020-02-10T10:28:51Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:16:16Z","closed_at":"2020-02-11T08:22:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"741072a3c1ae86e56dc0daf1a08d371613e16e26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27521/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27521/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27521/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90b46609be928eef436d9ac09a7e7c2bafd954c5","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-29462","ref":"SPARK-29462","sha":"90b46609be928eef436d9ac09a7e7c2bafd954c5","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

After creating the driver pod, we create other resources. This PR simply reverses the order, it first creates the configmaps and then tries to mount them as k8s volumes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl describe po spark-driver\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Before this PR\r\n<img width=\"1203\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-02-10 at 3 10 01 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/992952/74140116-7d1af200-4c1a-11ea-9180-1db1fb943094.png\">\r\n\r\n### After this PR\r\n<img width=\"1203\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-02-10 at 3 10 16 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/992952/74140123-80ae7900-4c1a-11ea-8e6e-12adba1bfd2b.png\">\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.17/#configmapvolumesource-v1-core\r\nKubernetes allows an optional field indicating, that if the mount for this config map fails, then it is not reattempted nor the pod is declared to be failed.\r\nIn our current code base, we try to mount the volumes and create them later, it works because, kubernetes reattempts failed mounting attempt, because the `optional` field is `false` by default.\r\nBut, if this optional field is set to true, then that mount will not take place at all. Because, when the mount is performed the volume is not created - so mount fails. And this time the mount is not reattempted because the optional field is set as true.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have tested the patch, by manually running with and without the change and observed the event log in kubectl describe.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-10T10:05:36Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T07:33:18Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T07:33:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"655f0cba4b2000f3b79cc471810da106cfc061e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27520/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27520/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27520/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/514caddf6e022842c1a052c214d4bc78ed606e3d","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:failed_mount","ref":"failed_mount","sha":"514caddf6e022842c1a052c214d4bc78ed606e3d","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn our production environment, there are many queries similar to this pattern:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE spark_30768_1(user_id DECIMAL(18,0), src_cre_dt DATE /*other columns*/);\r\nCREATE TABLE spark_30768_2(user_id DECIMAL(18,0), start_dt DATE, end_dt DATE /*other columns*/);\r\n\r\nSELECT spark_30768_1.src_cre_dt /*other columns*/                                                \r\nFROM                                                                            \r\n  spark_30768_1                                                                 \r\n  INNER JOIN spark_30768_2 ON spark_30768_1.user_id = spark_30768_2.user_id     \r\n  AND spark_30768_1.src_cre_dt >= spark_30768_2.start_dt                        \r\n  AND spark_30768_1.src_cre_dt < spark_30768_2.end_dt                           \r\nWHERE spark_30768_1.src_cre_dt BETWEEN date '2020-02-01' AND date '2020-02-07'      \r\n```\r\nIn this case, we can infer more constraints to improve query performance. E.g. `spark_30768_2.start_dt <= '2020-02-07'` inferred from `spark_30768_2.start_dt <= spark_30768_1.src_cre_dt <= '2020-02-07'` and `spark_30768_2.end_dt > '2020-02-01'` inferred from `spark_30768_2.end_dt > spark_30768_1.src_cre_dt >= '2020-02-01'`.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to prune unnecessary nested fields from Generate which has no Project on top of it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Optimizer, we can prune nested columns from Project(projectList, Generate). However, unnecessary columns could still possibly be read in Generate, if no Project on top of it. We should prune it too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use Java 8 time API in timestamp truncations to the levels of `HOUR` and `DAY`. The problem is in the usage of `timeZone.getOffset(millis)` in days/hours truncations where the combined calendar (Julian + Gregorian) is used underneath.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change fix wrong truncations. For example, the following truncation to hours should print `0010-01-01 01:00:00` but it outputs wrong timestamp:\r\n```scala\r\nSeq(\"0010-01-01 01:02:03.123456\").toDF()\r\n    .select($\"value\".cast(\"timestamp\").as(\"ts\"))\r\n    .select(date_trunc(\"HOUR\", $\"ts\").cast(\"string\"))\r\n    .show(false)\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n|CAST(date_trunc(HOUR, ts) AS STRING)|\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n|0010-01-01 01:30:17                 |\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the result of the example above is:\r\n```scala\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n|CAST(date_trunc(HOUR, ts) AS STRING)|\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n|0010-01-01 01:00:00                 |\r\n+------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new test to `DateFunctionsSuite`\r\n- By `DateExpressionsSuite` and `DateTimeUtilsSuite`","created_at":"2020-02-09T17:53:47Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:43:31Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T14:17:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e81e4cdfd591afb1f700fa1a363658d846065ca7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/913492a526e866d4ac719a720c7036d8a6e1b77d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-trunc-old-timestamp","ref":"fix-trunc-old-timestamp","sha":"913492a526e866d4ac719a720c7036d8a6e1b77d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen doing base operator abstraction work, we found there are still some code snippet is  inconsistent with other abstraction code style. This PR addressed following two code refactor cases.\r\n\r\n**Case 1** Override keyword missed for some fields in derived classes. The compiler will not capture it if we rename some fields in the future.\r\n\r\n**Case 2** Inconsistent abstract class field definition. The updated style will simplify derived class definition, e.g. `EvalPythonExec` `WindowExecBase`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the code style consistency and code quality\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-09T15:29:30Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T06:51:03Z","closed_at":"2020-02-27T07:40:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"655d22a29a72f84cc53d78ef2a38f43123df88b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/839f7b04a766252d034e46fea6b2da3c5ed3c361","head":{"label":"Eric5553:BaseClassAbstraction","ref":"BaseClassAbstraction","sha":"839f7b04a766252d034e46fea6b2da3c5ed3c361","user":{"login":"Eric5553","id":10626956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54733158,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDczMzE1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"Eric5553/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Eric5553","id":10626956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe style of `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` output needs to be improved. We’ve already got some observations/ideas in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27368#discussion_r376694496 \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27368#discussion_r376927143\r\n\r\nObservations/Ideas:\r\n1. Using comma as the separator is not clear, especially commas are used inside the expressions too.\r\n2. Show the column counts first? For example, `Results [4]: …`\r\n3. Currently the attribute names are automatically generated, this need to refined.\r\n4. Add arguments field in common implementations as `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` did by calling `argString` in `TreeNode.simpleString`. This will eliminate most existing minor differences between \r\n`EXPLAIN EXTENDED` and `EXPLAIN FORMATTED`.\r\n5. Another improvement we can do is: the generated alias shouldn't include attribute id. collect_set(val, 0, 0)#123 looks clearer than collect_set(val#456, 0, 0)#123\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently addressing comments 2 & 4, and open for more discussions on improving readability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe readability of `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` need to be improved, which will help user better understand the query plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` output style changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate expect results of test cases in explain.sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR consist the following:\r\n\r\n1. Many of the organisations are facing issue to migrate their current database such as Mysql to Hadoop & Spark Ecosystem\r\n2. Created a Demo Pipeline where I have covered 3 use cases:\r\n   **Case 1: Storing & then reading from HDFS Part File in Spark**\r\n   **Case 2: Converting it into parquete format & then reading from parquete file format in SPARK**\r\n   **Special Case: Directly analyisng in Spark from MySQL without storing in HDFS**\r\n3. Finally after all the aggregations in Spark, generating a reporting Dashboard using Tableau.\r\n\r\nWell, this Code may help many of the Spark Users who are willing to do this.","created_at":"2020-02-09T07:34:41Z","updated_at":"2020-05-24T14:11:35Z","closed_at":"2020-05-24T14:11:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d55326ef46e86bc79bd36856044e6e509cf9b9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/797015c1f08d25fe751697045d5311bc995cd33d","head":{"label":"DJeyCodeX:feature/migrating-onPremise-database-to-Spark","ref":"feature/migrating-onPremise-database-to-Spark","sha":"797015c1f08d25fe751697045d5311bc995cd33d","user":{"login":"DJeyCodeX","id":42927710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTI3NzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42927710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX","html_url":"https://github.com/DJeyCodeX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239182504,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzkxODI1MDQ=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"DJeyCodeX/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DJeyCodeX","id":42927710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTI3NzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42927710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX","html_url":"https://github.com/DJeyCodeX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DJeyCodeX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DJeyCodeX/spark-1","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix `cache` initialization in `StringRegexExpression` by changing `case Literal(value: String, StringType)` to `case p: Expression if p.foldable`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nActually, the case doesn't work at all because of:\r\n1. Literals value has type `UTF8String`\r\n2. It doesn't work for foldable expressions like in the example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT '%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John' _FUNC_ '%SystemDrive%\\\\Users.*';\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Screen Shot

The maximum number of typed columns supported is 5. If wanting to select more than 5 typed columns, it silently calls untyped `Dataset.select` and can causes weird unresolved error, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: unresolved operator 'Aggregate [fooagg(FooAgg(1), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#114, assertnotnull(cast(value#114 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#113, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_1#116, fooagg(FooAgg(2), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#119, assertnotnull(cast(value#119 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#118, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_2#121, fooagg(FooAgg(3), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#124, assertnotnull(cast(value#124 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#123, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_3#126, fooagg(FooAgg(4), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#129, assertnotnull(cast(value#129 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#128, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_4#131, fooagg(FooAgg(5), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#134, assertnotnull(cast(value#134 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#133, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_5#136, fooagg(FooAgg(6), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#139, assertnotnull(cast(value#139 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#138, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_6#141];;\r\n'Aggregate [fooagg(FooAgg(1), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#114, assertnotnull(cast(value#114 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#113, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_1#116, fooagg(FooAgg(2), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#119, assertnotnull(cast(value#119 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#118, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_2#121, fooagg(FooAgg(3), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#124, assertnotnull(cast(value#124 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#123, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_3#126, fooagg(FooAgg(4), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#129, assertnotnull(cast(value#129 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#128, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_4#131, fooagg(FooAgg(5), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#134, assertnotnull(cast(value#134 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#133, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_5#136, fooagg(FooAgg(6), None, None, None, input[0, int, false] AS value#139, assertnotnull(cast(value#139 as int)), input[0, int, false] AS value#138, IntegerType, IntegerType, false) AS foo_agg_6#141]\r\n+- Project [_1#6 AS a#13, _2#7 AS b#14, _3#8 AS c#15, _4#9 AS d#16, _5#10 AS e#17, _6#11 AS F#18]\r\n +- LocalRelation [_1#6, _2#7, _3#8, _4#9, _5#10, _6#11]\r\n\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$class.failAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:43)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer.failAnalysis(Analyzer.scala:95)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$$anonfun$checkAnalysis$3.apply(CheckAnalysis.scala:431)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$$anonfun$checkAnalysis$3.apply(CheckAnalysis.scala:430)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreeNode.foreachUp(TreeNode.scala:127)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$class.checkAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:430)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, to fully disallow typed columns as input to untyped `select` API will break current usage like `count` that is a `TypedColumn` in `functions`. In order to keep compatibility, we should allow current usage of certain `TypedColumn`s as input to untyped `select` API. For the `TypedColumn`s that will cause unresolved exception, we should explicitly let users know that they are incorrectly calling untyped `select` with typed columns which need input type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, but this PR only refines the error message.\r\n\r\nWhen users call `Dataset.select` API with typed column that needs input type, an analysis exception will be thrown. Previously an unresolved error will be thrown. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen executing the following query using a week based pattern the result is null.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select unix_timestamp('2020-10', 'YYYY-ww')\").show\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|unix_timestamp(2020-10, YYYY-ww)|\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n|                            null|\r\n+--------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can replicate this behavior with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.time.temporal._\r\nimport java.time.format._\r\nimport java.util.Locale\r\nimport java.time.chrono.IsoChronology\r\n\r\nval pattern = \"YYYY-ww\"\r\nval locale = Locale.US\r\nval s = \"2020-10\"\r\nval formatter = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder().appendPattern(pattern)\r\n    .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.ERA, 1)\r\n    .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR, 1)\r\n    .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1)\r\n    .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.MINUTE_OF_HOUR, 0)\r\n    .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.SECOND_OF_MINUTE, 0)\r\n    .toFormatter(locale)\r\n    .withChronology(IsoChronology.INSTANCE)\r\n    .withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle.STRICT)\r\n\r\nval result = formatter.parse(s)\r\nresult.query(TemporalQueries.localDate)\r\n```\r\nThe date is parsed, but not resolved.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the default temporal fields that are conflicting with the week based values:\r\n```\r\n      .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.ERA, 1)\r\n      .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR, 1)\r\n      .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid this conflict, I propose to check if the pattern is a week/year based and change the defaults as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.ERA, 1)\r\n      .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK, 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nAdditonally in JDK8 there is know issue for patterns `(YYYYww/YYww)` [https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8145633](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8145633) which fails to parse contiguos patterns without separation, this has been fixed in version 9. To avoid parsing issues add a separator like this `(YYYY-ww/YYYY ww)`\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWeek/Year based dates should be supported since it is part of ISO8601. Also, as seen in [SPARK-30688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30688), this issue is failing silently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n- No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n- Passing current tests\r\n- Added test case for different timezones in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates the documentation on `TableCatalog.alterTable`s behavior on the order by which the requested changes are applied. It now explicitly mentions that the changes are applied in the order given.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current documentation on `TableCatalog.alterTable` doesn't mention which order the requested changes are applied. It will be useful to explicitly document this behavior so that the user can expect the behavior. For example, `REPLACE COLUMNS` needs to delete columns before adding new columns, and if the order is guaranteed by `alterTable`, it's much easier to work with the catalog API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, document change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNot added (doc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to rewrite the `millisToDays` and `daysToMillis` of `DateTimeUtils` using Java 8 time API.\r\n\r\nI removed `getOffsetFromLocalMillis` from `DateTimeUtils` because it is a private methods, and is not used anymore in Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNew implementation is based on Proleptic Gregorian calendar which has been already used by other date-time functions. This changes make `millisToDays` and `daysToMillis` consistent to rest Spark SQL API related to date & time operations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this might effect behavior for old dates before 1582 year.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, DateExpressionsSuite`, `SQLQuerySuite` and `HiveResultSuite`.","created_at":"2020-02-07T21:16:49Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:43:36Z","closed_at":"2020-02-12T18:32:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ea38462123a23908da1214647515ad4b1cbb705","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5d463f67d68efcff046851479b4789d1e4f50a0","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:millis-2-days-java8-api","ref":"millis-2-days-java8-api","sha":"e5d463f67d68efcff046851479b4789d1e4f50a0","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26434\r\n\r\nThis PR use one special shuffle reader for skew join, so that we only have one join after optimization. In order to do that, this PR\r\n1. add a very general `CustomShuffledRowRDD` which support all kind of partition arrangement.\r\n2. move the logic of coalescing shuffle partitions to a util function, and call it during skew join optimization, to totally decouple with the `ReduceNumShufflePartitions` rule. It's too complicated to interfere skew join with `ReduceNumShufflePartitions`, as you need to consider the size of split partitions which don't respect target size already.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current skew join optimization has a serious performance issue: the size of the query plan depends on the number and size of skewed partitions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the case of back-to-back calculation of `floorDiv` and `floorMod` with the same arguments, the result of `foorDiv` can be reused in calculation of `floorMod`. The `floorMod` method is defined as the following in Java standard library:\r\n```java\r\n    public static int floorMod(int x, int y) {\r\n        int r = x - floorDiv(x, y) * y;\r\n        return r;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIf `floorDiv(x, y)` has been already calculated, it can be reused in `x - floorDiv(x, y) * y`.\r\n\r\nI propose to modify 2 places in `DateTimeUtils`:\r\n1. `microsToInstant` which is widely used in many date-time functions. `Math.floorMod(us, MICROS_PER_SECOND)` is just replaced by its definition from Java Math library.\r\n2. `truncDate`: `Math.floorMod(oldYear, divider) == 0` is replaced by `Math.floorDiv(oldYear, divider) * divider == oldYear` where `floorDiv(...) * divider` is pre-calculated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis reduces the number of arithmetic operations, and can slightly improve performance of date-time functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite` and `DateExpressionsSuite`.","created_at":"2020-02-07T09:41:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:43:43Z","closed_at":"2020-02-11T15:07:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c34a5f76df14a0c5b93a52704d9f033ca30a96e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38cd6dab1b7c16fbd36ed43ef289630ac2de3aaa","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:opt-microsToInstant","ref":"opt-microsToInstant","sha":"38cd6dab1b7c16fbd36ed43ef289630ac2de3aaa","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to throw exception by default when user use untyped UDF(a.k.a `org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf(AnyRef, DataType)`).\r\n\r\nAnd user could still use it by setting `spark.sql.legacy.useUnTypedUdf.enabled` to `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to #23498, since Spark 3.0, the untyped UDF will return the default value of the Java type if the input value is null. For example, `val f = udf((x: Int) => x, IntegerType)`, `f($\"x\")` will  return 0 in Spark 3.0 but null in Spark 2.4. And the behavior change is introduced due to Spark3.0 is built with Scala 2.12 by default.\r\n\r\nAs a result, this might change data silently and may cause correctness issue if user still expect `null` in some cases. Thus, we'd better to encourage user to use typed UDF to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYeah. User will hit exception now when use untyped UDF.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test and updated some

datasets.\r\nPerfermance test of LogisticRegression (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27374) on sparse dataset shows that blockify vectors to matrices and use BLAS will cause performance regression.\r\nLinearSVC and LinearRegression were also updated in the same way as LogisticRegression, so we need to revert them to make sure no regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to support Hive-style `ALTER TABLE ... REPLACE COLUMNS ...` as described in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-Add/ReplaceColumns\r\n\r\nThe user now can do the following:\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE t (col1 int, col2 int) USING Foo;\r\nALTER TABLE t REPLACE COLUMNS (col2 string COMMENT 'comment2', col3 int COMMENT 'comment3');\r\n```\r\n, which drops the existing columns `col1` and `col2`, and add new columns `col2` and `col3`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a new DDL statement. Spark currently supports the Hive-style `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN ...`, so this new addition can be useful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adding a new DDL statement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`LIKE ANY/SOME` and `LIKE ALL` operators are mostly used when we are matching a text field with numbers of patterns. For example:\r\n\r\nTeradata / Hive 3.0 / Snowflake:\r\n```sql\r\n--like any\r\nselect 'foo' LIKE ANY ('%foo%','%bar%');\r\n\r\n--like all\r\nselect 'foo' LIKE ALL ('%foo%','%bar%');\r\n```\r\nPostgreSQL:\r\n```sql\r\n-- like any\r\nselect 'foo' LIKE ANY (array['%foo%','%bar%']);\r\n\r\n-- like all\r\nselect 'foo' LIKE ALL (array['%foo%','%bar%']);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR add support these two operators.\r\n\r\nMore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Rewrite the `convertTz` method of `DateTimeUtils` using Java 8 time API\r\n- Change types of `convertTz` parameters from `TimeZone` to `ZoneId`. This allows to avoid unnecessary conversions `TimeZone` -> `ZoneId` and performance regressions as a consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Fixes incorrect behavior of `to_utc_timestamp` on daylight saving day. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df.select(to_utc_timestamp(lit(\"2019-11-03T12:00:00\"), \"Asia/Hong_Kong\").as(\"local UTC\")).show\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|          local UTC|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|2019-11-03 03:00:00|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n```\r\nbut the result must be 2019-11-03 04:00:00:\r\n<img width=\"1013\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-02-06 at 20 09 36\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1580697/73960846-a129bb00-491c-11ea-92f5-45831cb28a62.png\">\r\n\r\n- Simplifies the code, and make it more maintainable\r\n- Switches `convertTz` on Proleptic Gregorian calendar used by Java 8 time classes by default. That makes the function consistent to other date-time functions. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes `to_utc_timestamp` returns the correct result `2019-11-03 04:00:00`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suite `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite` and `DateExpressionsSuite`.\r\n- Added `convert time zones on a daylight saving day` to DateFunctionsSuite","created_at":"2020-02-06T08:35:43Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:43:46Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T18:32:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4646b6889fc709d38e11a97aae76390233227c96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f31364612d7d0ae57f43740394a6e511825b3a43","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:port-convertTz-on-Java8-api","ref":"port-convertTz-on-Java8-api","sha":"f31364612d7d0ae57f43740394a6e511825b3a43","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to document the Pandas UDF redesign with type hints introduced at SPARK-28264.\r\nMostly self-describing; however, there are few things to note for reviewers.\r\n\r\n1. This PR replace the existing documentation of pandas UDFs to the newer redesign to promote the Python type hints. I added some words that Spark 3.0 still keeps the compatibility though.\r\n\r\n2. This PR proposes to name non-pandas UDFs as \"Pandas Function API\"\r\n\r\n3. SCALAR_ITER become two separate sections to reduce confusion:\r\n  - `Iterator[pd.Series]` -> `Iterator[pd.Series]`\r\n  - `Iterator[Tuple[pd.Series, ...]]` -> `Iterator[pd.Series]`\r\n\r\n4. I removed some examples that look overkill to me.\r\n\r\n5. I also removed some information in the doc, that seems duplicating or too much.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo document new redesign in pandas UDF.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR use a specific version of docker image instead of `latest`.

However, the API change seems to occur again. We had better use a specific version to prevent accidental failures.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n- .withImage(\"ceph/daemon:v4.0.0-stable-4.0-master-centos-7-x86_64\")\r\n+ .withImage(\"ceph/daemon:latest\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass `Launcher client dependencies` test in Jenkins K8s Integration Suite.\r\nOr, run K8s Integration test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdding new boolean parameter to `partitionBy` method in DataFrameWriter.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  @scala.annotation.varargs\r\n  def partitionBy(needRepartition: Boolean, colNames: String*): DataFrameWriter[T] = {\r\n    this.partitioningColumns = Option(colNames)\r\n    if(needRepartition) needRepartitionBasedColumns = true\r\n    this\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `partitionBy(true, cols)` is specified, the `needRepartitionBasedColumns` parameter sets `true`. Based on this parameter, when writing data with `saveToV1Source()`, the `repartition` method based on columns is called before writing data.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  private def saveToV1Source(): Unit = {\r\n    partitioningColumns.foreach { columns =>\r\n      extraOptions += (DataSourceUtils.PARTITIONING_COLUMNS_KEY ->\r\n        DataSourceUtils.encodePartitioningColumns(columns))\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Code path for data source v1.\r\n    var dfx = df\r\n    if(needRepartitionBasedColumns) {\r\n      dfx = df.repartition(partitioningColumns.toArray.flatten.map(df.col): _*)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    runCommand(dfx.sparkSession, \"save\") {\r\n      DataSource(\r\n        sparkSession = dfx.sparkSession,\r\n        className = source,\r\n        partitionColumns = partitioningColumns.getOrElse(Nil),\r\n        options = extraOptions.toMap).planForWriting(mode, dfx.logicalPlan)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis new functionality is possible to help many Spark users who use partitionBy when writing data with DataFrame.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBasically not. This new functionality enables user to specify additional boolean parameter for `partitionBy`. When specifying this parameter such as `partitionby(true, cols)`, the repartition method based on specified columns is internally called and is expected to enhance performance and to decrease memory usage when writing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot yet. However, I confirmed that it works by actual testing with DataFrameReader and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are currently the R test failures after upgrading `testthat` to 2.0.0, and R version 3.5.2 as of SPARK-23435. This PR targets to fix the tests and make the tests pass. See the explanations and causes below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_context.R:49: failure: Check masked functions\r\nlength(maskedCompletely) not equal to length(namesOfMaskedCompletely).\r\n1/1 mismatches\r\n[1] 6 - 4 == 2\r\n\r\ntest_context.R:53: failure: Check masked functions\r\nsort(maskedCompletely, na.last = TRUE) not equal to sort(namesOfMaskedCompletely, na.last = TRUE).\r\n5/6 mismatches\r\nx[2]: \"endsWith\"\r\ny[2]: \"filter\"\r\n\r\nx[3]: \"filter\"\r\ny[3]: \"not\"\r\n\r\nx[4]: \"not\"\r\ny[4]: \"sample\"\r\n\r\nx[5]: \"sample\"\r\ny[5]: NA\r\n\r\nx[6]: \"startsWith\"\r\ny[6]: NA\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom my cursory look, R base and R's version are mismatched. I fixed accordingly and Jenkins will test it out.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_includePackage.R:31: error: include inside function\r\npackage or namespace load failed for ���plyr���:\r\n package ���plyr��� was installed by an R version with different internals; it needs to be reinstalled for use with this R version\r\nSeems it's a package installation issue. Looks like plyr has to be re-installed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom my cursory look, previously installed `plyr` remains and it's not compatible with the new R version. I fixed accordingly and Jenkins will test it out.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:499: warning: SPARK-17811: can create DataFrame containing NA as date and time\r\nYour system is mis-configured: ���/etc/localtime��� is not a symlink\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems a env problem. I suppressed the warnings for now.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:499: warning: SPARK-17811: can create DataFrame containing NA as date and time\r\nIt is strongly recommended to set envionment variable TZ to ���America/Los_Angeles��� (or equivalent)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems a env problem. I suppressed the warnings for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_sparkSQL.R:1814: error: string operators\r\nunable to find an inherited method for function ���startsWith��� for signature ���\"character\"���\r\n1: expect_true(startsWith(\"Hello World\", \"Hello\")) at /home/jenkins/workspace/SparkPullRequestBuilder@2/R/pkg/tests/fulltests/test_sparkSQL.R:1814\r\n2: quasi_label(enquo(object), label)\r\n3: eval_bare(get_expr(quo), get_env(quo))\r\n4: startsWith(\"Hello World\", \"Hello\")\r\n5: (function (classes, fdef, mtable) \r\n   {\r\n       methods <- .findInheritedMethods(classes, fdef, mtable)\r\n       if (length(methods) == 1L) \r\n           return(methods[[1L]])\r\n       else if (length(methods) == 0L) {\r\n           cnames <- paste0(\"\\\"\", vapply(classes, as.character, \"\"), \"\\\"\", collapse = \", \")\r\n           stop(gettextf(\"unable to find an inherited method for function %s for signature %s\", \r\n               sQuote(fdef@generic), sQuote(cnames)), domain = NA)\r\n       }\r\n       else stop(\"Internal error in finding inherited methods; didn't return a unique method\", \r\n           domain = NA)\r\n   })(list(\"character\"), new(\"nonstandardGenericFunction\", .Data = function (x, prefix) \r\n   {\r\n       standardGeneric(\"startsWith\")\r\n   }, generic = structure(\"startsWith\", package = \"SparkR\"), package = \"SparkR\", group = list(), \r\n       valueClass = character(0), signature = c(\"x\", \"prefix\"), default = NULL, skeleton = (function (x, \r\n           prefix) \r\n       stop(\"invalid call in method dispatch to 'startsWith' (no default method)\", domain = NA))(x, \r\n           prefix)), <environment>)\r\n6: stop(gettextf(\"unable to find an inherited method for function %s for signature %s\", \r\n       sQuote(fdef@generic), sQuote(cnames)), domain = NA)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom my cursory look, R base and R's version are mismatched. I fixed accordingly and Jenkins will test it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR causes a CRAN check failure as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* creating vignettes ... ERROR\r\nError: processing vignette 'sparkr-vignettes.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:\r\npackage ���htmltools��� was installed by an R version with different internals; it needs to be reinstalled for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the session local time zone defined by the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone` instead of system JVM time zone in `DateTimeUtils.converTz`. In the case when those time zones are different, `convertTz` assumes wrongly that its input timestamp was parsed from local timestamp string using JVM time zone. Such assumption was correct in the past when timestamp strings were parsed by `java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf`. Currently, timestamp strings are converted to timestamp value via `CAST` which uses the session local time zone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes wrong behavior of the `to_utc_timestamp` and `from_utc_timestamp` function in the case when system JVM time zone is different from session time zone.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, when session local time zone is different from system JVM time zone.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suites. In particular, by tests for `from_utc_timestamp` and `to_utc_timestamp`.\r\n- Added new tests to `DateFunctionsSuite` for various JVM time zone, session time zone and to/from time zones.","created_at":"2020-02-04T20:44:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:43:49Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T06:57:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfd64bc78d5286b1f7d0b7f97945e07d493fbe0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a74bf0fa309586375b5ebdcf25b38ace4b37ee1d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:convertTz-local-tz","ref":"convertTz-local-tz","sha":"a74bf0fa309586375b5ebdcf25b38ace4b37ee1d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for #22787. In #22787 we disallowed empty strings for json parser except for string and binary types. This follow-up adds a legacy config for restoring previous behavior of allowing empty string.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdding a legacy config to make migration easy for Spark users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. If set this legacy config to true, the users can restore previous behavior prior to Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEagerly filter out zombie `TaskSetManager` before offering resources to reduce any overhead as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd this PR also avoid doing `recomputeLocality` and `addPendingTask` when `TaskSetManager` is zombie.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nZombie `TaskSetManager` could still exist in Pool's `schedulableQueue` when it has running tasks. Offering resources on a zombie `TaskSetManager` could bring unnecessary overhead and is meaningless.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass Jenkins.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-04T15:30:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-06T04:57:34Z","closed_at":"2020-02-06T04:48:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91ec3f09936d808fdeefa9a62d03cfa45041ad19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up for #25029, in this PR we throw an AnalysisException when name conflict is detected in nested WITH clause. In this way, the config `spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedence.enabled` should be set explicitly for the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe original change might risky to end-users, it changes behavior silently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, change the config `spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedence.enabled` as optional.\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new statistic called `deserFactor` which can be set manualy as a table property 'spark.deserFactor' and intended to be used for columnar file formats as a ratio of actual data size (raw data size) to file size to scale up the file size to improve the estimate of in-memory data size and having a better query optimization (i.e., join strategy decision).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this change Spark estimated the table size as the sum of all the file sizes. This estimate can be way too low at columnar file formats where huge data can be compressed into a very small file because of serialization (like dictionary encoding) and compression. \r\nWith the `deserFactor` OOM error raised as a result of a wrongly chosen broadcast join strategy can be avoided.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe StatisticsSuite is extended with a new test: `SPARK-24914 - test deserialization factor`.","created_at":"2020-02-04T14:52:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-12T00:25:55Z","closed_at":"2020-06-12T00:25:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d62393bed8f5fc24b90f236a6c7b9278f8a9a38d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e78b4b07e566a02580502242df13de6a9c0d2a60","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-24914-first-half","ref":"SPARK-24914-first-half","sha":"e78b4b07e566a02580502242df13de6a9c0d2a60","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","ev

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR renames `spark.sql.pandas.udf.buffer.size` to `spark.sql.execution.pandas.udf.buffer.size` to be more consistent with other pandas configuration prefixes, given:\r\n-  `spark.sql.execution.pandas.arrowSafeTypeConversion`\r\n- `spark.sql.execution.pandas.respectSessionTimeZone`\r\n- `spark.sql.legacy.execution.pandas.groupedMap.assignColumnsByName`\r\n- other configurations like `spark.sql.execution.arrow.*`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make configuration names consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because this configuration was not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to fix a potential bug in AQE where an `ExecSubqueryExpression` could be mistakenly replaced with another `ExecSubqueryExpression` with the same `ListQuery` but a different `child` expression.\r\nThis is because a ListQuery's id can only identify the ListQuery itself, not the parent expression `InSubquery`, but right now the `subqueryMap` in `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan` uses the `ListQuery`'s id as key and the corresponding `InSubqueryExec` for the `ListQuery`'s parent expression as value. So the fix uses the corresponding `SubqueryExec` for the `ListQuery` itself as the map's value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis logical bug could potentially cause a wrong query plan, which could throw an exception related to unresolved columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPassed existing UTs.","created_at":"2020-02-03T23:41:18Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:21:02Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T04:32:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54aa7f922a61c83975ca5528659604d1f8aa7177","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d455ff01c7156426cc77ed8f5e50a98c5736c3de","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-30717","ref":"spark-30717","sha":"d455ff01c7156426cc77ed8f5e50a98c5736c3de","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current ALTER COLUMN syntax allows to change multiple properties at a time:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE table=multipartIdentifier\r\n  (ALTER | CHANGE) COLUMN? column=multipartIdentifier\r\n  (TYPE dataType)?\r\n  (COMMENT comment=STRING)?\r\n  colPosition?   \r\n```\r\nThe SQL standard (section 11.12) only allows changing one property at a time. This is also true on other recent SQL systems like [snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/alter-table-column.html) and [redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_ALTER_TABLE.html). (credit to @cloud-fan)\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change ALTER COLUMN to follow SQL standard, thus allows altering only one column property at a time.\r\n\r\nNote that ALTER COLUMN syntax being changed here is newly added in Spark 3.0, so it doesn't affect Spark 2.4 behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo follow SQL standard (and other recent SQL systems) behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the user can update the column properties only one at a time.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE table1 ALTER COLUMN a.b.c TYPE bigint COMMENT 'new comment'\r\n```\r\nshould be broken into\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE table1 ALTER COLUMN a.b.c TYPE bigint\r\nALTER TABLE table1 ALTER COLUMN a.b.c COMMENT 'new comment'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why
