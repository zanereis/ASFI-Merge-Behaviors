What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo push the built jars to maven release repository, we need to remove the 'SNAPSHOT' tag from the version name.\r\n\r\nMade the following changes in this PR:\r\n* Update all the `3.0.0-SNAPSHOT` version name to `3.0.0-preview`\r\n* Update the PySpark version from `3.0.0.dev0` to `3.0.0`\r\n\r\n**Please note those changes were generated by the release script in the past, but this time since we manually add tags on master branch, we need to manually apply those changes too.**\r\n\r\nWe shall revert the changes after 3.0.0-preview release passed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the maven release repository to accept the built jars.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr proposes  to fix the Duration  in Completed Stages in StagePage in the spark UI.\r\n\r\nJIRA Issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29585\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Summary Metrics for Completed Tasks uses ```executorRunTime```, and Duration in Task details uses ```executorRunTime```, but Duration in Completed Stages uses ```stageData.completionTime - stageData.firstTaskLaunchedTime```, which results in different results. So the Duration in Completed Stages in StagePage should also use executorRunTime.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-24T07:06:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T15:05:05Z","closed_at":"2019-11-06T15:05:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd3274ee16868561d5b0c5dbf7b2ca70b4cae99a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkSession.sql() method parse process not under current sparksession's conf, so some configuration about parser is not valid in multi-thread situation.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we add a SQLConf parameter to AbstractSqlParser and initial it with SessionState's conf.\r\nThen for each SparkSession's parser process. It will use's it's own SessionState's SQLConf and to be thread safe\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd support of `TaskContext.get()` in a barrier task from Python side, this makes it easier to migrate legacy user code to barrier execution mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Spark Core, there is a `TaskContext` object which is a singleton. We set a task context instance which can be TaskContext or BarrierTaskContext before the task function startup, and unset it to none after the function end. So we can both get TaskContext and BarrierTaskContext with the object. However we can only get the BarrierTaskContext with `BarrierTaskContext`, we will get `None` if we get it by `TaskContext.get` in a barrier stage.\r\n\r\nThis is useful when people switch from normal code to barrier code, and only need a little update.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nPreviously:\r\n```python\r\ndef func(iterator):\r\n    task_context = TaskContext.get() . # this could be None.\r\n    barrier_task_context = BarrierTaskContext.get() # get the BarrierTaskContext instance\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nrdd.barrier().mapPartitions(func)\r\n```\r\n\r\nProposed:\r\n```python\r\ndef func(iterator):\r\n    task_context = TaskContext.get() . # this could also get the BarrierTaskContext instance which is same as barrier_task_context\r\n    barrier_task_context = BarrierTaskContext.get() # get the BarrierTaskContext instance\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nrdd.barrier().mapPartitions(func)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT tests.","created_at":"2019-10-24T02:53:05Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T04:52:13Z","closed_at":"2019-10-31T04:11:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"704f480c36745182ce3759d7e8d5e79fa23e9297","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3d14c83de89775e5bba7f5a94cc2101dacbe9bb","head":{"label":"ConeyLiu:barrier_task_context","ref":"barrier_task_context","sha":"a3d14c83de89775e5bba7f5a94cc2101dacbe9bb","user":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54686577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDY4NjU3Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ConeyLiu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd UncacheTableStatement and make UNCACHE TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nUNCACHE TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. When running UNCACHE TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInstead of using ZStd codec directly, we use Spark's CompressionCodec which wraps ZStd codec in a buffered stream to avoid overhead excessive of JNI call while trying to compress/decompress small amount of data.\r\n\r\nAlso, by using Spark's CompressionCodec, we can easily to make it configurable in the future if it's needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFaster performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a `V1Scan` interface, so that data source v1 implementations can migrate to DS v2 much easier.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a lot of work to migrate v1 sources to DS v2. The new API added here can allow v1 sources to go through v2 code paths without implementing all the Batch, Stream, PartitionReaderFactory, ... stuff.\r\n\r\nWe already have a v1 write fallback API after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25348\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReimplement the iterator in UnsafeExternalRowSorter in database style. This can be done by reusing the `RowIterator` in our code base.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDuring the job in #26164, after involving a var `isReleased` in `hasNext`, there's possible that `isReleased` is false when calling `hasNext`, but it becomes true before calling `next`. A safer way is using database-style iterator: `advanceNext` and `getRow`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes our documentation build to copy minified jquery file instead.\r\n\r\nThe original file `jquery.js` seems missing as of Scala 2.12 upgrade. Scala 2.12 seems started to use minified `jquery.min.js` instead.\r\n\r\nSince we dropped Scala 2.11, we won't have to take care about legacy `jquery.js` anymore.\r\n\r\nNote that, there seem multiple weird stuff in the current ScalaDoc (e.g., some pages are weird, it starts from `scala.collection.*` or some pages are missing, or some docs are truncated, some badges look missing). It needs a separate double check and investigation.\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to make the documentation generation pass in order to unblock Spark 3.0 preview.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix and make our official documentation build able to run.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt will enable to build the documentation in our official way.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaking directory api/scala\r\ncp -r ../target/scala-2.12/unidoc/. api/scala\r\nMaking directory api/java\r\ncp -r ../target/javaunidoc/. api/java\r\nUpdating JavaDoc files for badge post-processing\r\nCopying jquery.js from Scala API to Java API for page post-processing of badges\r\njekyll 3.8.6 | Error:  No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - ./api/scala/lib/jquery.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaking directory api/scala\r\ncp -r ../target/scala-2.12/unidoc/. api/scala\r\nMaking directory api/java\r\ncp -r ../target/javaunidoc/. api/java\r\nUpdating JavaDoc files for badge post-processing\r\nCopying jquery.min.js from Scala API to Java API for page post-processing of badges\r\nCopying api_javadocs.js to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a SQL Conf: `spark.sql.streaming.stopActiveRunOnRestart`. When this conf is `true` (by default it is), an already running stream will be stopped, if a new copy gets launched on the same checkpoint location.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn multi-tenant environments where you have multiple SparkSessions, you can accidentally start multiple copies of the same stream (i.e. streams using the same checkpoint location). This will cause all new instantiations of the new stream to fail. However, sometimes you may want to turn off the old stream, as the old stream may have turned into a zombie (you no longer have access to the query handle or SparkSession).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a SQL flag that allows the stopping of the old stream for such zombie cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Now by default, if you launch a new copy of an already running stream on a multi-tenant cluster, the existing stream will be stopped.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates JDBC Integration Test DBMS Docker Images.\r\n\r\n| DBMS | Docker Image Tag | Release |\r\n| ------ | ------------------ | ------ |\r\n| MySQL | mysql:5.7.28 | Oct 13, 2019 |\r\n| PostgreSQL | postgres:12.0-alpine | Oct 3, 2019 |\r\n\r\n* For `MySQL`, `SET GLOBAL sql_mode = ''` is added to disable all strict modes because `test(\"Basic write test\")` creates a table like the following. The latest MySQL rejects `0000-00-00 00:00:00` as TIMESTAMP and causes the test case failure.\r\n```\r\nmysql> desc datescopy;\r\n+-------+-----------+------+-----+---------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n| Field | Type      | Null | Key | Default             | Extra                       |\r\n+-------+-----------+------+-----+---------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n| d     | date      | YES  |     | NULL                |                             |\r\n| t     | timestamp | NO   |     | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   | on update CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |\r\n| dt    | timestamp | NO   |     | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |                             |\r\n| ts    | timestamp | NO   |     | 0000-00-00 00:00:00 |                             |\r\n| yr    | date      | YES  |     | NULL                |                             |\r\n+-------+-----------+------+-----+---------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n```\r\n* For `PostgreSQL`, I chose the smallest image in `12` releases. It reduces the image size a lot, `312MB` -> `72.8MB`. This is good for CI/CI testing environment.\r\n```\r\n$ docker images | grep postgres\r\npostgres      12.0-alpine          5b681acb1cfc        2 days ago          72.8MB\r\npostgres      11.4                 53912975086f        3 months ago        312MB\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that\r\n- For `MsSqlServer`, we are using `2017-GA-ubuntu` and the next version `2019-CTP3.2-ubuntu` is still `Community Technology Preview` status.\r\n- For `DB2` and `Oracle`, the official images are not available.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is to make it sure we are testing with the latest DBMS images during preparing `3.0.0`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSince this is the integration test, we need to run this manually.\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn install -DskipTests\r\nbuild/mvn -Pdocker-integration-tests -pl :spark-docker-integration-tests_2.12

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCluster deploy mode is not applicable to Spark Thrift server now. This restriction is too rude.\r\nIn our production, we use multiple Spark Thrift servers as long running services which are used yarn-cluster mode to launch. The life cycle of STS is managed by upper layer manager system which is also used to dispatcher user's JDBC connection to applicable STS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test with command:\r\n```\r\nsbin/start-thriftserver.sh --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster --queue myqueue\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-23T08:28:32Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T10:21:24Z","closed_at":"2019-11-05T06:55:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"595631193d8698bf7199269dc3780ed48346bcc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1445212545,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQ1MjEyNTQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SUBMIT","name":"SPARK

a bit of background on the code being changed. The current code tracks\r\nmetric updates for each task, recording which metrics the task is monitoring\r\nand the last update value.\r\n\r\nOnce a SQL execution finishes, then the metrics for all the stages are\r\naggregated, by building a list with all (metric ID, value) pairs collected\r\nfor all tasks in the stages related to the execution, then grouping by metric\r\nID, and then calculating the values shown in the UI.\r\n\r\nThat is full of inefficiencies:\r\n\r\n- in normal operation, all tasks will be tracking and updating the same\r\n  metrics. So recording the metric IDs per task is wasteful.\r\n- tracking by task means we might be double-counting values if you have\r\n  speculative tasks (as a comment in the code mentions).\r\n- creating a list of (metric ID, value) is extremely inefficient, because now\r\n  you have a huge map in memory storing boxed versions of the metric IDs and\r\n  values.\r\n- same thing for the aggregation part, where now a Seq is built with the values\r\n  for each metric ID.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that for large queries, this code can become both really\r\nslow, thus affecting the processing of events, and memory hungry.\r\n\r\nThe updated code changes the approach to the following:\r\n\r\n- stages track metrics by their ID; this means the stage tracking code\r\n  naturally groups values, making aggregation later simpler.\r\n- each metric ID being tracked uses a long array matching the number of\r\n  partitions of the stage; this means that it's cheap to update the value of\r\n  the metric once a task ends.\r\n- when aggregating, custom code just concatenates the arrays corresponding to\r\n  the matching metric IDs; this is cheaper than the previous, boxing-heavy\r\n  approach.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that the listener uses about half as much memory as before\r\nfor tracking metrics, since it doesn't need to track metric IDs per task.\r\n\r\nI captured heap dumps with the old and the new code during metric aggregation\r\nin the listener, for an execution with 3 stages, 100k tasks per stage, 50\r\nmetrics updated per task. The dumps contained just reachable memory - so data\r\nkept by the listener plus the variables in the aggregateMetrics() method.\r\n\r\nWith the old code, the thread doing aggregation references >1G of memory - and\r\nthat does not include temporary data created by the \"groupBy\" transformation\r\n(for which the intermediate state is not referenced in the aggregation method).\r\nThe same thread with the new code references ~250M of memory. The old code uses\r\nabout ~250M to track all the metric values for that execution, while the new\r\ncode uses about ~130M. (Note the per-thread numbers include the amount used to\r\ntrack the metrics - so, e.g., in the old case, aggregation was referencing\r\nabout ~750M of temporary data.)\r\n\r\nI'm also including a small benchmark (based on the Benchmark class) so that we\r\ncan measure how much changes to this code affect performance. The benchmark\r\ncontains some extra code to measure things the normal Benchmark class does not,\r\ngiven that the code under test does not really map that well to the\r\nexpectations of that class.\r\n\r\nRunning with the old code (I removed results that don't make much\r\nsense for this benchmark):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_181-b13 on Linux 4.15.0-66-generic\r\n[info] Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6820HQ CPU @ 2.70GHz\r\n[info] metrics aggregation (50 metrics, 100k tasks per stage):  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)\r\n[info] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[info] 1 stage(s)                                                  2113           2118\r\n[info] 2 stage(s)                                                  4172           4392\r\n[info] 3 stage(s)                                                  7755           8460\r\n[info]\r\n[info] Stage Count    Stage Proc.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake `ResolveRelations` call `ResolveTables` at the beginning, and make `ResolveTables` call `ResolveTempViews`(newly added) at the beginning, to ensure the relation resolution priority.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo resolve an `UnresolvedRelation`, the general process is:\r\n1. try to resolve to (global) temp view first. If it's not a temp view, move on\r\n2. if the table name specifies a catalog, lookup the table from the specified catalog. Otherwise, lookup table from the current catalog.\r\n3. when looking up table from session catalog, return a v1 relation if the table provider is v1.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this process is done by 2 rules: `ResolveTables` and `ResolveRelations`. To avoid rule conflicts, we add a lot of checks:\r\n1. `ResolveTables` only resolves `UnresolvedRelation` if it's not a temp view and the resolved table is not v1.\r\n2. `ResolveRelations` only resolves `UnresolvedRelation` if the table name has less than 2 parts.\r\n\r\nThis requires to run `ResolveTables` before `ResolveRelations`, otherwise we may resolve a v2 table to a v1 relation.\r\n\r\nTo clearly guarantee the resolution priority, and avoid massive changes, this PR proposes to call one rule in another rule to ensure the rule execution order. Now the process is simple:\r\n1. first run `ResolveTempViews`, see if we can resolve relation to temp view\r\n2. then run `ResolveTables`, see if we can resolve relation to v2 tables.\r\n3. finally run `ResolveRelations`, see if we can resolve relation to v1 tables.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn my streaming application``spark.streaming.concurrentJobs`` is set to 50 which is used as size for underlying thread pool. I perform several sql operations on dataframes and automatically create/alter tables/view in runtime. I order to do that i invoke ``create ... if not exists operations`` on driver on each batch invocation. Once i noticed that  most of batch time is spent on driver but not on executors. I made a thread dump and figured out that most of the threads are blocked on SessionCatalog operation waiting for a lock.  \r\n\r\nExisting implementation of SessionCatalog uses a single lock which is used almost by all the methods to guard ``currentDb`` and ``tempViews`` variables. I propose to enhance locking behaviour of SessionCatalog by :\r\n\r\n1. Employing ``ReadWriteLock`` which allows to execute read operations concurrently. \r\n2. Replace synchronized with the corresponding read or write lock.\r\n\r\nAlso it's possible to go even further and strip locks for ``currentDb`` and ``tempViews`` but i'm not sure whether it's possible from the implementation point of view. \r\nProbably someone will help me with this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOnly via existing test suits.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-22T15:11:23Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T00:06:56Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T00:06:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1fd446c90bd08fd1c9f87c34cdbc77e4ceca2f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b50d8f7b96f39b38d343b027e387d9f26c738457","head":{"label":"choojoyq:SPARK-29550-enhance-session-catalog-locking","ref":"SPARK-29550-enhance-session-catalog-locking","sha":"b50d8f7b96f39b38d343b027e387d9f26c738457","user":{"login":"choojoyq","id":13151161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUxMTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13151161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq","html_url":"https://github.com/choojoyq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":202108409,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDIxMDg0MDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"choojoyq/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"choojoyq","id":13151161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUxMTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13151161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq","html_url":"https://github.com/choojoyq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/choojoyq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/choojoyq/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe shall have a new mechanism that the downstream operators may notify its parents that they may release the output data stream. In this PR, we implement the mechanism as below:\r\n- Add function named `cleanupResources` in SparkPlan, which default call children's `cleanupResources` function, the operator which need a resource cleanup should rewrite this with the self cleanup and also call `super.cleanupResources`, like SortExec in this PR.\r\n- Add logic support on the trigger side, in this PR is SortMergeJoinExec, which make sure and call the `cleanupResources` to do the cleanup job for all its upstream(children) operator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix for SortMergeJoin memory leak, and implement a general framework for SparkPlan resource cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT: Add new test suite JoinWithResourceCleanSuite to check both standard and code generation scenario.\r\n\r\nIntegrate Test: Test with driver/executor default memory set 1g, local mode 10 thread. The below test(thanks taosaildrone for providing this test  [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23762#issuecomment-463303175)) will pass with this PR.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`OptimizeLocalShuffleReader` rule is very conservative and gives up optimization as long as there are extra shuffles introduced. It's very likely that most of the added local shuffle readers are fine and only one introduces extra shuffle.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's very hard to make `OptimizeLocalShuffleReader` optimal, a simple workaround is to run this rule again right before executing a query stage.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize more shuffle reader to local shuffle reader.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting ut\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-22T11:21:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T17:18:28Z","closed_at":"2019-10-23T17:18:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"896d170f58f3c5d2b069be522830407fd20f3f2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b372636f8820ece343e7fd7c1e1a0d1f60fadb8f","head":{"label":"JkSelf:resolve-multi-joins-issue","ref":"resolve-multi-joins-issue","sha":"b372636f8820ece343e7fd7c1e1a0d1f60fadb8f","user":{"login":"JkSelf","id":11972570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTcyNTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11972570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf","html_url":"https://github.com/JkSelf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159634260,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk2MzQyNjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"JkSelf/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JkSelf","id":11972570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTcyNTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11972570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf","html_url":"https://github.com/JkSelf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JkSelf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JkSelf/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen an executor lost with some reason and some things (e.g. the external shuffle service or host lost on the executor's host.) happened, and the executor loses time happens to be reduce stage fetch failed from it which is really bad, the previous only call `mapOutputTracker.unregisterMapOutput(shuffleId, mapIndex, bmAddress) ` to mark clear shuffle status for the mapper at this time , but the other mappers shuffle status on the executor are also unnavailable and the DagScheduler does Not  know that, so the reduce stages will fetch failed again when fetch them,  the unavailable shuffle status can only be resubmitted by a nest retry stage which is the regression.\r\n\r\nAs we all know that the previous will call ` mapOutputTracker.removeOutputsOnHost(host) `  to  mark clear shuffle status on the host  or `mapOutputTracker.removeOutputsOnExecutor(execId) ` to  mark clear shuffle status on the executor  when reduce stage fetches failed and the executor is active, while it does NOT nothing when the executor lost happened, which  is really bad .\r\n\r\nSo we should distinguish the failedEpoch of 'executor lost' from the fetchFailedEpoch of 'fetch failed' to solve the above problem.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe regression  has been described above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unittests.","created_at":"2019-10-22T11:16:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T00:12:30Z","closed_at":"2020-02-24T00:12:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8c20acac6139c9ae76a856414d0b28f805c6ba5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn a production environment, user behavior is highly random and uncertain.\r\nFor example: Users use `System.out` or `System.err` to print information.\r\nBut the system print stream may cause some trouble, such as: the disk file is too large.\r\n\r\nIn my production environment, it causes the disk to be full and let [NodeManager] works not fine.\r\n\r\nA method of threat is to forbid the use of `System.out` or `System.err`. But unfriendly to the users.\r\nA better method is to redirecting the system print stream to `Log4j` and Spark can take advantage of `Log4j`'s split log.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `docker-integration-tests` is broken in both JDK8/11. \r\nThis PR aims to recover JDBC integration test for JDK8/11. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhile SPARK-28737 upgraded `Jersey` to 2.29 for JDK11, `docker-integration-tests` is broken because `com.spotify.docker-client` still depends on `jersey-guava`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd ShowPartitionsStatement and make SHOW PARTITIONS go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. When running SHOW PARTITIONS, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2019-10-21T23:17:59Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T22:06:30Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T21:47:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7089ef582106f3c2719665483591595a7d22c50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26198/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26198/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26198/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/248513ca8edc7b83a03c44a145554c0c36474a00","head":{"label":"huaxingao:spark-29539","ref":"spark-29539","sha":"248513ca8edc7b83a03c44a145554c0c36474a00","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements monte-carlo simulation of p-values for the ChiSqTest in mllib. For other implementations, see the following references:\r\n* https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.1/topics/chisq.test\r\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_p-value\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile monte-carlo simulation is a common approach to estimate p-values, a robust scalable implementation in Spark was non-trivial, so we hope others can re-use these efforts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nWe provide a new boolean parameter `simulatePValue` to the ChiSqTest so that users can request p-value simulation, and also an integer parameter `numDraw` so that users can specify the number of draws to take. The `getChi2Digest` method is also exposed in case users find value in the digest object itself which allows extraction of arbitrary quantiles, cdf, etc.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis PR also implements the `ChiSqTestSuite` with some tests to verify that both the ChiSqTest itself and the new p-value simulation are working correctly by evaluating that test cases expected to pass and fail a chi squared test actually work as expected. \r\n\r\nWe ran these tests with the following results: \r\n```\r\n$ build/mvn package -pl mllib -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.mllib.stat.test.ChiSqTestSuite\r\n...\r\nChiSqTestSuite:\r\n- theoretical chi2 test\r\n- simulated/empirical chi2 test\r\nRun completed in 1 minute, 22 seconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 2\r\nSuites: completed 2, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 2, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n...\r\n[INFO] BUILD

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen user defined a base path which is not an ancestor directory for all the input paths,\r\nthrow exception immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAssuming that we have a DataFrame[c1, c2] be written out in parquet and partitioned by c1.\r\n\r\nWhen using `spark.read.parquet(\"/path/to/data/c1=1\")` to read the data, we'll have a DataFrame with column c2 only.\r\n\r\nBut if we use `spark.read.option(\"basePath\", \"/path/from\").parquet(\"/path/to/data/c1=1\")` to\r\nread the data, we'll have a DataFrame with column c1 and c2.\r\n\r\nThis's happens because a wrong base path does not actually work in `parsePartition()`, so paring would continue until it reaches a directory without \"=\".\r\n\r\nAnd I think the result of the second read way doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, with this change, user would hit `IllegalArgumentException ` when given a wrong base path while previous behavior doesn't.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInline cloudpickle in PySpark to cloudpickle 1.1.1. See https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/blob/v1.1.1/cloudpickle/cloudpickle.py\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/269 was added for Python 3.8 support (fixed from 1.1.0). Using 1.2.2 seems breaking PyPy 2 due to cloudpipe/cloudpickle#278 so this PR currently uses 1.1.1.\r\n\r\nOnce we drop Python 2, we can switch to the highest version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\npositional-only arguments was newly introduced from Python 3.8 (see https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#positional-only-parameters)\r\n\r\nParticularly the newly added argument to `types.CodeType` was the problem (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#changes-in-the-python-api):\r\n\r\n> `types.CodeType` has a new parameter in the second position of the constructor (posonlyargcount) to support positional-only arguments defined in **PEP 570**. The first argument (argcount) now represents the total number of positional arguments (including positional-only arguments). The new `replace()` method of `types.CodeType` can be used to make the code future-proof.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. Note that the optional dependency PyArrow looks not yet supporting Python 3.8; therefore, it was not tested. See \"Details\" below.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests --python-executables=python3.8\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nRunning PySpark tests.

takes a different approach to solve this problem. However, this patch implements a new feature of ability to provide logging configuration via config maps. But, this patch will change if the PR at #27735 is merged before this.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug, after submitting a spark job to k8s cluster, kubernetes pods including driver and executor are not able to pick the configured - logging configuration (i.e.`log4j.properties` file specified at `conf` dir located inside the spark home).\r\n\r\n It is picked up correctly after this patch. More details on how to debug is also on the associated JIRA.\r\n\r\nThis patch also introduces a new feature, propagate correct logging configuration file either by picking up from user specified logger configuration file or through user specified kubernetes config map. Where user specified config map takes precedence.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPlease see referenced JIRA.\r\nApart from that, I have added a new feature i.e. an ability to provide logging configuration via a kubernetes config map [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#configmap).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt adds two configuration options, documentation is updated for those.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested.\r\nAdded some unit tests as well.\r\nAdded integration tests for both configuring via a config map and also picking the correct log4j configuration file.\r\nAlso added a doc section on the usage of this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Current limitation:\r\n_In the client mode, we cannot create a config map on our own, but then that is by design - how k8s mode is designed. So, a user needs to create their config maps containing the log4j configuration and submit. This step is only applicable when in client mode. It can be convenient, if this could be automated as well._\r\n^^ This limitation is overcome by the approach taken in the PR #27735.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded new benchmark `IntervalBenchmark` to measure performance of interval related functions. In the PR, I added benchmarks for casting strings to interval. In particular, interval strings with `interval` prefix and without it because there is special code for this https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/da576a737c2db01e5ba5ce19ed0e8f900cb5efaf/common/unsafe/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/unsafe/types/CalendarInterval.java#L100-L103 . And also I added benchmarks for different number of units in interval strings, for example 1 unit is `interval 10 years`, 2 units w/o interval is `10 years 5 months`, and etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To find out current performance issues in casting to intervals\r\n- The benchmark can be used while refactoring/re-implementing `CalendarInterval.fromString()` or `CalendarInterval.fromCaseInsensitiveString()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the benchmark via the command:\r\n```shell\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/test:runMain org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.IntervalBenchmark\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-21T08:48:52Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:48Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T01:47:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8bc72ecbe6d49bcbaf5f641b7b40f9cec158ac87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1772543c12909500c9f98558beffc2f978ffb72a","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:interval-from-string-benchmark","ref":"interval-from-string-benchmark","sha":"1772543c12909500c9f98558beffc2f978ffb72a","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd ShowCreateTableStatement and make SHOW CREATE TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nSHOW CREATE TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes. When running SHOW CREATE TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-20T19:21:11Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:23:00Z","closed_at":"2019-10-25T15:09:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"558db4b6aba1f724e06c16ecd5ec2d3331b910c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6cb88c9afb0fac110e154da2c06674f879d6d2fe","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-29527","ref":"SPARK-29527","sha":"6cb88c9afb0fac110e154da2c06674f879d6d2fe","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd RefreshTableStatement and make REFRESH TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nREFRESH TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. When running REFRESH TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests","created_at":"2019-10-20T14:55:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T15:46:08Z","closed_at":"2019-10-23T15:26:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1251876ccc58cdf7643173157a746f6e0beba723","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/31bfc6f5098701b70a95ac3dd4fc5b3c2ecbdee0","head":{"label":"imback82:refresh_table","ref":"refresh_table","sha":"31bfc6f5098701b70a95ac3dd4fc5b3c2ecbdee0","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd ShowColumnsStatement and make SHOW COLUMNS go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nSHOW COLUMNS FROM t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. When running SHOW COLUMNS Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2019-10-20T10:33:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T07:02:29Z","closed_at":"2019-10-31T02:13:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2e8a58680aef4b9ddf336c33a64e7059fe34cf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5365243ee4ff41ec244d975745b0fce272a65b81","head":{"label":"planga82:feature/SPARK-29523_SHOW_COLUMNS_datasourceV2","ref":"feature/SPARK-29523_SHOW_COLUMNS_datasourceV2","sha":"5365243ee4ff41ec244d975745b0fce272a65b81","user":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182507758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1MDc3NTg=","name":"sparkFork","full_name":"planga82/sparkFork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/planga82/sparkFork","description":"Apache

Modification of the regexp becomes very hard to support new features.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- This improves Spark SQL UX by allowing users to specify interval units in any order\r\n- Existing regex is hard to extend\r\n- To maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing tests in `CalendarIntervalSuite`\r\n- Add new test for invalid unit `dday`\r\n- By new tests for uniqueness and unordered interval units in `CalendarIntervalSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-20T09:28:11Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:48Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T18:57:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45e3a3f47c0cad4b941f67c7c6853f0c740831ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b05434687dbb73f0baab38d8696cd368a2c21adf","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:interval-units-order","ref":"interval-units-order","sha":"b05434687dbb73f0baab38d8696cd368a2c21adf","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd CacheTableStatement and make CACHE TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nCACHE TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes. When running CACHE TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd LoadDataStatement and make LOAD DATA INTO TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nLOAD DATA INPATH 'filepath'  INTO TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes. When running LOAD DATA INTO TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Added `getDuration()` to calculate interval duration in specified time units assuming provided days per months\r\n- Added `isNegative()` which return `true` is the interval duration is less than 0\r\n- Fix checking negative intervals by using `isNegative()` in structured streaming classes\r\n- Fix checking of `year-months` intervals\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes incorrect checking of negative intervals. An interval is negative when its duration is negative but not if interval's months **or** microseconds is negative. Also this fixes checking of `year-month` interval support because the `month` field could be negative.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nShould not\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests for the `getDuration()` and `isNegative()` methods to `IntervalUtilsSuite`\r\n- By existing SS tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-19T17:17:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:50Z","closed_at":"2019-10-31T07:35:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"209561c84c81e722a4d95dde2345a94741c1473b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd ShowTablePropertiesStatement and make SHOW TBLPROPERTIES go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nSHOW TBLPROPERTIES t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. When running SHOW TBLPROPERTIES Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2019-10-19T16:42:58Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T05:31:48Z","closed_at":"2019-11-12T05:31:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0dbc3883b9fcb834dab7a50e162d1dd40dac48d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26176/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26176/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26176/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/846e21a96e106f44fa0b88ab71d07095995b3790","head":{"label":"planga82:feature/SPARK-29519_SHOW_TBLPROPERTIES_datasourceV2","ref":"feature/SPARK-29519_SHOW_TBLPROPERTIES_datasourceV2","sha":"846e21a96e106f44fa0b88ab71d07095995b3790","user":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182507758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1MDc3NTg=","name":"sparkFork","full_name":"planga82/sparkFork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/planga82/sparkFork","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd TruncateTableStatement and make TRUNCATE TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nTRUNCATE TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes. When running TRUNCATE TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2019-10-19T07:01:43Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:37:53Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T11:17:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f772870b24bbce757c0c057a2974aacc65ff75de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae50eec75f212d1840f441fabe3572c2094bdd5a","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-29517","ref":"SPARK-29517","sha":"ae50eec75f212d1840f441fabe3572c2094bdd5a","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere's a case where MapObjects has a lambda function which creates nested struct - unsafe data in safe data struct. In this case, MapObjects doesn't copy the row returned from lambda function (as outmost data type is safe data struct), which misses copying nested unsafe data.\r\n\r\nThe culprit is that `UnsafeProjection.toUnsafeExprs` converts `CreateNamedStruct` to `CreateNamedStructUnsafe` (this is the only place where `CreateNamedStructUnsafe` is used) which incurs safe and unsafe being mixed up temporarily, which may not be needed at all at least logically, as it will finally assembly these evaluations to `UnsafeRow`.\r\n\r\n> Before the patch\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* 105 */   private ArrayData

If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Adding an additional check in `stringToTimestamp` to handle cases where the input has trailing ':'\r\n* Added a test to make sure this works.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn a couple of scenarios while converting from String to Timestamp `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp` throws an array out of bounds exception if there is trailing  ':'. The behavior of this method requires it to return `None` in case the format of the string is incorrect. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test in the `DateTimeTestUtils` suite to test if my fix works.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-18T22:51:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:25:28Z","closed_at":"2019-10-19T23:06:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ead0389f1fb3379625f580124dbea3f183b58a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4376b88dfc1f278cc97fb8b162c4277bc98148ac","head":{"label":"rahulsmahadev:araryOB","ref":"araryOB","sha":"4376b88dfc1f278cc97fb8b162c4277bc98148ac","user":{"login":"rahulsmahadev","id":51690557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjkwNTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51690557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulsmahadev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":215602087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTU2MDIwODc=","name":"spark","full_name":"rahulsmahadev/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahulsmahadev","id":51690557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjkwNTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51690557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulsmahadev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahulsmahadev/spark","description":"Apache

2.4 added the ability for executor plugins to be loaded into\r\nSpark (see SPARK-24918). That feature intentionally skipped the\r\ndriver to keep changes small, and also because it is possible to\r\nload code into the Spark driver using listeners + configuration.\r\n\r\nBut that is a bit awkward, because the listener interface does not\r\nprovide hooks into a lot of Spark functionality. This change reworks\r\nthe executor plugin interface to also extend to the driver.\r\n\r\n- there's a \"SparkPlugin\" main interface that provides APIs to\r\n  load driver and executor components.\r\n- custom metric support (added in SPARK-28091) can be used by\r\n  plugins to register metrics both in the driver process and in\r\n  executors.\r\n- a communication channel now exists that allows the plugin's\r\n  executor components to send messages to the plugin's driver\r\n  component easily, using the existing Spark RPC system.\r\n\r\nThe latter was a feature intentionally left out of the original\r\nplugin design (also because it didn't include a driver component).\r\n\r\nTo avoid polluting the \"org.apache.spark\" namespace, I added the new\r\ninterfaces to the \"org.apache.spark.api\" package, which seems like\r\na better place in any case. The actual implementation is kept in\r\nan internal package.\r\n\r\nThe change includes unit tests for the new interface and features,\r\nbut I've also been running a custom plugin that extends the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd RepairTableStatement and make REPAIR TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nMSCK REPAIR TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. When running MSCK REPAIR TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests","created_at":"2019-10-18T19:11:04Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:25:28Z","closed_at":"2019-10-19T05:44:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8af923632e9fdaa9860ad49efd06255900ac1cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6135df92d599ae32df045d5ae72a7637a43052e0","head":{"label":"imback82:repair_table","ref":"repair_table","sha":"6135df92d599ae32df045d5ae72a7637a43052e0","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR supports MERGE INTO in the parser and add the corresponding logical plan. The SQL syntax likes,\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO [ds_catalog.][multi_part_namespaces.]target_table [AS target_alias]\r\nUSING [ds_catalog.][multi_part_namespaces.]source_table | subquery [AS source_alias]\r\nON <merge_condition>\r\n[ WHEN MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <matched_action> ]\r\n[ WHEN MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <matched_action> ]\r\n[ WHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND <condition> ]  THEN <not_matched_action> ]\r\n```\r\nwhere\r\n```\r\n<matched_action>  =\r\n  DELETE  |\r\n  UPDATE SET *  |\r\n  UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe shall have a new mechanism that the downstream operators may notify its parents that they may release the output data stream. In this PR, we implement the mechanism as below:\r\n- Add function named `cleanupResources` in SparkPlan, which default call children's `cleanupResources` function, the operator which need a resource cleanup should rewrite this with the self cleanup and also call `super.cleanupResources`, like SortExec in this PR.\r\n- Add logic support on the trigger side, in this PR is SortMergeJoinExec, which make sure and call the `cleanupResources` to do the cleanup job for all its upstream(children) operator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBugfix for SortMergeJoin memory leak, and implement a general framework for SparkPlan resource cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT: Add new test suite JoinWithResourceCleanSuite to check both standard and code generation scenario.\r\n\r\nIntegrate Test: Test with driver/executor default memory set 1g, local mode 10 thread.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCredit to @uncleGen for discovering the problem and providing simple reproducer as UT. New UT in this patch is borrowed from #26156 and I'm retaining a commit from #26156 (except unnecessary part on this path) to properly give a credit.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue that partition ID could be mis-assigned when the query contains UNION and stream-stream join is placed on the right side. We assume the range of partition IDs as `(0 ~ number of shuffle partitions - 1)` for stateful operators, but when we use stream-stream join on the right side of UNION, the range of partition ID of task goes to `(number of partitions in left side, number of partitions in left side + number of shuffle partitions - 1)`, which `number of partitions in left side` can be changed in some cases (new UT points out the one of the cases). \r\n\r\nThe root reason of bug is that stream-stream join picks the partition ID from TaskContext, which wouldn't be same as partition ID from source if union is being used. Hopefully we can pick the right partition ID from source in StateStoreAwareZipPartitionsRDD - this patch leverages that partition ID.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis patch will fix the broken of assumption of partition range on stateful operator, as well as fix the issue reported in JIRA issue SPARK-29438.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if their query is using UNION and stream-stream join is placed on the right side. They may encounter the problem to read state from checkpoint and may need to discard checkpoint to continue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT which fails on current master branch, and passes with this patch.","created_at":"2019-10-18T10:31:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T05:04:47Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T04:22:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8a8b1246c21f40c35eb58e5c979f41ad58bc581","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

In addition current behavior creates a problem to the Spark Operator and any other operator as it cannot detect failure at the K8s level.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually by launching SparkPi with a large number 100000000 which leads to an oom due to the large number of tasks allocated.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$kubectl logs spark-pi-driver -n spark\r\n19/10/18 09:47:02 INFO KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend: SchedulerBackend is ready for scheduling beginning after reached minRegisteredResourcesRatio: 0.8\r\n19/10/18 09:47:02 INFO BlockManagerMasterEndpoint: Registering block manager 172.17.0.6:33435 with 413.9 MiB RAM, BlockManagerId(2, 172.17.0.6, 33435, None)\r\n#\r\n# java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n# -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=\"kill -9 %p\"\r\n#   Executing /bin/sh -c \"kill -9 14\"...\r\n```\r\nAlso there are two integration tests for the K8s resource manager. Testing might be needed for the other managers.","created_at":"2019-10-18T09:58:06Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T20:29:43Z","closed_at":"2020-07-25T00:32:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5271422ee7cb8703446717bdd0036eb7a2cafd10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a correctness bug. \r\nNow, Spark use the `TaskPartitionId` to determine the StateStore path.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTaskPartitionId   \\ \r\nStateStoreVersion  --> StoreProviderId -> StateStore\r\nStateStoreName    /  \r\n```\r\nIn spark stages, the task partition id is determined by the number of tasks. As we said the StateStore file path depends on the task partition id. So if stream-stream join task partition id is changed against last batch, it will get wrong StateStore data or fail with non-exist StateStore data. In some corner cases, it happened. Following is a sample pseudocode:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df3 = streamDf1.join(streamDf2)\r\nval df5 = streamDf3.join(batchDf4)\r\nval df = df3.union(df5)\r\ndf.writeStream...start()\r\n```\r\nA simplified DAG like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDataSourceV2Scan   Scan Relation     DataSourceV2Scan   DataSourceV2Scan\r\n (streamDf3)            |               (streamDf1)        (streamDf2)\r\n     |                  |                   |                 |\r\n  Exchange(200)      Exchange(200)       Exchange(200)     Exchange(200)\r\n     |                  |                   |                 | \r\n   Sort                Sort                 |                 |\r\n     \\                  /                   \\                 /\r\n      \\                /                     \\               /\r\n        SortMergeJoin                    StreamingSymmetricHashJoin\r\n                     \\                 /\r\n                       \\             /\r\n                         \\         /\r\n                            Union\r\n```\r\nStream-Steam join task Id will start from 200 to 399 as they are in the same stage with `SortMergeJoin`. But when there is no new incoming data in `streamDf3` in some batch, it will generate a empty LocalRelation, and then the SortMergeJoin will be replaced with a BroadcastHashJoin. In this case, Stream-Steam join task Id will start from 1 to 200. Finally, it will get wrong StateStore path through TaskPartitionId, and failed with error reading state store delta file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nLocalTableScan   Scan Relation     DataSourceV2Scan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe trees (Array[```DecisionTreeRegressionModel```]) in ```RandomForestRegressionModel``` only contains the default parameter value. Need to update the parameter maps for these trees. \r\nSame issues in ```RandomForestClassifier```, ```GBTClassifier``` and ```GBTRegressor```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser wants to access each individual tree and build the trees back up for the random forest estimator. This doesn't work because trees don't have the correct parameter values\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Now the trees in ```RandomForestRegressionModel```, ```RandomForestClassifier```, ```GBTClassifier``` and ```GBTRegressor``` have the correct parameter values. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-18T01:37:48Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T14:48:29Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T09:50:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7e9d7ae75463acb01108efabbdc2e2f97f9e9ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24234894188592d96a6b06c6bba622143cc5bf92","head":{"label":"huaxingao:spark-29232","ref":"spark-29232","sha":"24234894188592d96a6b06c6bba622143cc5bf92","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29500\r\n\r\n`KafkaRowWriter` now supports setting the Kafka partition by reading a \"partition\" column in the input dataframe.\r\n\r\nCode changes in commit nr. 1.\r\nTest changes in commit nr. 2.\r\nDoc changes in commit nr. 3.\r\n\r\n@tcondie @dongjinleekr @srowen \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile it is possible to configure a custom Kafka Partitioner with\r\n`.option(\"kafka.partitioner.class\", \"my.custom.Partitioner\")`, this is not enough for certain use cases. See the Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, as this behaviour is optional.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTwo new UT were added and one was updated.","created_at":"2019-10-17T21:26:32Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T13:06:45Z","closed_at":"2019-10-25T13:06:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5a269214d1f20959466c385c0a6ee78a4582844","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of #26093 to `branch-2.4`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27812\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27927\r\n\r\nWe need this fix https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/pull/1768 that was released on version 4.6 of the client. The root cause of the problem is better explained in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25785\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested manually using a simple pyspark job\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour of this \"job\" is that both python's and jvm's process exit automatically after the main runs. This is the case for spark versions <= 2.4. On version 2.4.3, the jvm process hangs because there's a non daemon thread running \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"OkHttp WebSocket https://10.96.0.1/...\" #121 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb27c005800 nid=0x24b waiting on condition [0x00007fb300847000]\r\n\"OkHttp WebSocket https://10.96.0.1/...\" #117 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb28c004000 nid=0x247 waiting on condition [0x00007fb300e4b000]\r\n```\r\nThis is caused by a bug on `kubernetes-client` library, which is fixed on the version that we are upgrading to.\r\n\r\nWhen the mentioned job is run with this patch applied, the behaviour from spark <= 2.4.0 is restored and both processes terminate successfully

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`SupportsPushDownRequiredColumns` should return the pruned schema, instead of building the `Scan` and get `readSchema` from `Scan`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI found this problem while developing the v1 read fallback API following https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25348.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, v1 read fallback API needs to rely on `ScanBuilder` to do filter pushdown and column pruning, and create a v1 `BaseRelation` at the end.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `SupportsPushDownRequiredColumns` is not well designed. Spark must create the v2 `Scan` to get the result of column pruning: the pruned schema. This is not possible for data sources implementing v1 read fallback API.\r\n\r\nBy doing this change, we also make it easier to implement DS v2: users don't need to implement schema twice (in `Table` and `Scan`) if they don't support column pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Add 2 api method for spark core, similar to rdd.countApprox\r\n- def countApprox(confidence: Double, samplePartitions: Int)\r\n- def countApprox(confidence: Double, samplePercent: Double)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrent countApprox(timeout: Long, confidence: Double = 0.95) can not stop when timeout comes, still running at background, this is a waste of resources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,  user can using countApprox() like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39302402/66997192-93012600-f104-11e9-800f-829717318e1f.png)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo test case added, but testing by spark-shell,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd mapPartitionsWithIndex for RDDBarrier.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is only one method in `RDDBarrier`. We often use the partition index as a label for the current partition. We need to get the index from `TaskContext`  index in the method of `mapPartitions` which is not convenient.\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo help make the error messages more user friendly, and also to allow people to more quickly narrow down on unbalanced parentheses within large, complicated expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere is a new type of parse error that can be shown, but there is no net behavior change to the SQL parser.\r\n\r\nConsider two simple queries.\r\n\r\n1. `select (r + 1))`\r\n2. `select ((r + 1)`\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore, the error messages would be the following, respectively.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException: \r\nextraneous input ')' expecting <EOF>(line 1, pos 14)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect (r + 1)) \r\n--------------^^^\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException: \r\nno viable alternative at input '((r + 1) '(line 1, pos 16)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect ((r + 1) \r\n----------------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException: \r\nUnbalanced parentheses (extra right)(line 1, pos 14)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect (r + 1)) \r\n--------------^^^\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException: \r\nUnbalanced parentheses (extra left)(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect ((r + 1) \r\n-------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSQL module `sbt` tests run and confirmed.","created_at":"2019-10-16T18:48:24Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T00:11:39Z","closed_at":"2020-04-20T00:11:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6f383feda9a7deaafe908b3d2ab35cb02246461","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f34ed69ad5b4a91bebc89ea7e724f70f3e0751e2","head":{"label":"jeff303:SPARK-27903","ref":"SPARK-27903","sha":"f34ed69ad5b4a91bebc89ea7e724f70f3e0751e2","user":{"login":"jeff303","id":3521562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3521562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303","html_url":"https://github.com/jeff303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":207907929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDc5MDc5Mjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"jeff303/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jeff303","id":3521562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3521562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303","html_url":"https://github.com/jeff303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jeff303/spark","description":"Apache
