Overview\r\n\r\nThe code that forwards attachment data to cluster nodes via fabric has a\r\nhard-coded timeout of five minutes for nodes to request the data. Making\r\nthis configurable lets us mitigate the impact of issue #3939, which\r\ncauses requests to block if one of the nodes already has the given\r\nattachment and doesn't end up requesting the data for it.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3939\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3940\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `_replication_* `fields are reserved for couchdb internal usage (indicated by the underscore prefix). Nonetheless the replicator docs are still editable by local admins. In order not to mislead them into thinking that editing these fields has any intentional effect, this PR prevents them from saving an update that changes any of these fields.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTry to change these fields as an admin (one without the reserved `_replicator` role) and confirm it fails.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR

Overview\r\n\r\nJust a work in progress right now, but the ideas I'm exploring include:\r\n\r\n1. Using the same container image for PRs in Jenkins and as the default container environ in e.g. VS Code\r\n2. Converting over to the official Erlang container images so we can automatically stay up-to-date with patch releases \r\n3. Using a separate FDB container for the FDB server and linking it to the development environment\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nOpening a PR to see how Jenkins handles the linked container approach.

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an extra `hello_from_writer` message into the handshake between the process that reads the multipart attachment data from the socket and the writer processes (potentially on remote nodes) that persist the data into each shard file. This ensures that even in the case where a writer does not end up asking for the data (e.g. because the revision already exists in the tree), the parser will monitor the writer and therefore know when the writer has exited.\r\n    \r\nThe patch makes some assumptions that the attachment flush function is executed in the same process as the initial one that is spawned to handle the fabric_rpc work request. That's true today, but if it changed in the future it would be a non-obvious breakage to debug.\r\n\r\nI'm not crazy about this solution to be quite honest, but I figured I could put it up for review anyway and see what others think.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI added an extra test to the `elixir-suite` target. Without this patch you should find that the test eventually causes some other part of the suite to hang, because the Erlang process handling one of the open TCP connections is stuck waiting for the attachment parser to exit. Again, I wish the test failed in a more obvious way, but I guess it's better than nothing.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes #3939\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written

Overview\r\n\r\nRecent refactor of `couch_index_server` made it a sharded implementation. This means multiple processes are in play now. This made it somewhat harder to bounce in production in case of problems. Also the `couch_debug:print_linked_processes(couch_index_server)` had an assumption that `couch_index_server` is a single process.\r\n\r\nThis PR does two very related things \r\n\r\n1. fixes `couch_debug:print_linked_processes(couch_index_server)`\r\n2. adds `couch_index_debug` module with auxiliary functions to restart `couch_index_server` processes safely. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. compile, start, remsh\r\n2. `couch_debug:print_linked_processes(couch_index_server).`\r\n```\r\n|name                                              | reductions | message_queue_len |    memory    |id\r\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|--\r\n|index_server_1[<0.320.0>]                         |    1127    |         0         |    17000     |\r\n|  couch_secondary_services[<0.312.0>]             |   93596    |         0         |    68632     |\r\n|  couch_event_listener:do_init/3[<0.323.0>]       |    203     |         0         |     2856     |\r\n|    index_server_1[<0.320.0>]                     |    1127    |         0         |    17000     |\r\n|                                                  |            |                   |              |\r\n|index_server_2[<0.324.0>]                         |    290     |         0         |     6088     |\r\n|  couch_secondary_services[<0.312.0>]             |   93598    |         0         |    68632     |\r\n|  couch_event_listener:do_init/3[<0.326.0>]       |    169     |         0         |     2856     |\r\n|    index_server_2[<0.324.0>]                     |    290     |         0         |     6088     |\r\n....\r\n```\r\n3. `couch_index_debug:help().`\r\n```\r\n[names,print_linked_processes,busy,restart_busy,restart]\r\n```\r\n4. `couch_index_debug:help(names)`\r\n5. `couch_index_debug:help(print_linked_processes)`\r\n6. `couch_index_debug:help(busy)`\r\n7. `couch_index_debug:help(restart_busy)`\r\n8.

this is my first contribution here!\r\n\r\nI have struggled with this point when building couchDB, because it's written nowhere in the documentation that you need to configure the version properly.\r\n\r\nIt seems that other people had the problem as well: https://couchdb.slack.com/archives/C49LEE7NW/p1632249155263400\r\n\r\nThe updated configure script automatically finds out the installed library version. It also introduces a dependency on `sed`, `ldconfig` and `head` which I hope are fine (will they work on MacOS?), and remove the default to version 1.8.5 which is old and not in most distributions anymore.\r\n\r\nThe argument was also removed from the CI scripts because it does not exist anymore.","created_at":"2022-02-17T21:28:38Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T10:09:16Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T10:09:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c08d5aedccd36650bd8708cdaeccb1d8d9a95e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/d915a5747a6d691f367a3542a54e72052ebcb0ce","head":{"label":"frapa:autodetect_spidermonkey_version","ref":"autodetect_spidermonkey_version","sha":"d915a5747a6d691f367a3542a54e72052ebcb0ce","user":{"login":"frapa","id":1306195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDYxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa","html_url":"https://github.com/frapa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460596444,"node_id":"R_kgDOG3Qk3A","name":"couchdb","full_name":"frapa/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frapa","id":1306195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDYxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa","html_url":"https://github.com/frapa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frapa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frapa/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a function to display view signature which corresponds to a given ddoc. \r\nThe function is intended for using in remsh while debugging view upgrade issues.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. start couch `dev/run --admin=adm:pass`\r\n2. start `remsh` session `dev/remsh`\r\n3. call a function for a database which has a ddoc `couch_mrview_debug:view_signature(<<\"db321\">>, <<\"ddoc321\">>).`\r\n4. make sure the help message for a function makes sense `couch_mrview_debug:help(view_signature).`\r\n5. make sure the function is listed in an output from `couch_mrview_debug:help().`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

If there is any\r\ngarbage database created by other tests, then it will fail.\r\n\r\nAdded two methods to avoid test instability:\r\n- Configure a temporary `database_dir` to avoid CI test

Overview\r\n\r\nThe `fabric_rpc_tests` pollutes the state of `shards_db` which causes flakiness\r\nof other tests. This PR fixes the problem by configuring temporary `database_dir`.\r\n\r\nThe important implementation detail is that we need to wait for all `couch_server`\r\nprocesses to restart. Before initroduction of sharded couch server in the\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3366 this could be done as:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ntest_util:with_process_restart(couch_server, fun() ->\r\n  config:set(\"couchdb\", \"database_dir\", NewDatabaseDir)\r\nend),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method has to be updated to support sharded `couch_server`. Following auxiliary\r\nfunctions where added:\r\n\r\n- `couch_server:names/0` - returns list of registered names of each\r\n  `couch_server` process\r\n- `test_util:with_processes_restart/{2,4}` - waits all process to be restarted\r\n  returns `{Pids :: #{} | timeout, Res :: term()}`\r\n- `test_util:with_couch_server_restart/1` - waits for all `couch_server` processes\r\nto finish restart\r\n\r\nThe new way of configuring `database_dir` in test suites is:\r\n\r\n```erlang\r\ntest_util:with_couch_server_restart(fun() ->\r\n  config:set(\"couchdb\", \"database_dir\", NewDatabaseDir)\r\nend),\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make eunit`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3366\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a rewrite of our Jenkins \"Full Platform Build\" jobs with the following features:\r\n\r\n* Updates to use Debian 11 (current stable) as the base image for building releases and packaging repos.\r\n\r\n* Defaults to Erlang 23 as the embedded Erlang version in packages. We avoid Erlang 24 for now because Clouseau is not currently compatible.\r\n\r\n* Dynamically generates the parallel build stages used to test and package CouchDB on various OSes. This is accomplished through a bit of scripted pipeline code that relies on two new methods defined at the beginning of the Jenkinsfile, one for \"native\" builds on macOS and FreeBSD and one for container-based builds. See comments in the Jenkinsfile for additional details.\r\n\r\n* Expands commands like `make check` into a series of steps to improve visibility. The Jenkins UI will now show the time spent in each step of the build process, and if a step (e.g. `make eunit`) fails it will only expand the logs for that step by default instead of showing the logs for the entire build stage. The downside is that if we do make changes to the series of targets underneath `check` we need to remember to update the Jenkinsfile as well.\r\n\r\n* Starts per-stage timer _after_ agent is acquired. Previously builds could fail with a 15m timeout when all they did was sit in the build queue.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nHere's the output from the branch build in Jenkins: https://ci-couchdb.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FFullPlatformMatrix/detail/jenkins-dynamic-matrix-3x/11/pipeline/\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #3903 with the following modifications:\r\n\r\n- Drop the `MINIMUM_ERLANG_VERSION` to 20\r\n- Drop the packaging `ERLANG_VERSION` to 23\r\n- Add the `weatherreport-test` as a build step\r\n- Add ARM and POWER back into the matrix using a new buildx-based multi-architecture container image.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR represents a prototype of a feature @janl and I have been working on. It lets us build indexes on dynamically computed values inside Mango, which would normally require writing a JS view. It does this by extending the syntax for indexes so that as well as the `asc` and `desc` sort directions, we allow an _expression_ to define a _virtual field_, for example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"fields\": [\r\n  { \"foo_words\": { \"$jq\": \".foo | split(\\\" \\\") | .[]\" } }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis definition means that the virtual field `foo_words` is generated by splitting the `foo` property on spaces and emitting each result. So if we have a document like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"foo\": \"a b c\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen this index lets us find that doc using the `_find` query `\"foo_words\": \"b\"`.\r\n\r\nThis is a prototype we're presenting to see if the functionality is of interest, before we commit any more work to making it more production-ready. Our reasoning for using `jq` for this is:\r\n\r\n- It's a ready-built expression language, we don't need to build a lot of the same functionality ourselves\r\n- It addresses design issues we faced trying to come up with our own function definition syntax, e.g.:\r\n  - How do we indicate that a function input is taken from doc property vs a literal value\r\n  - How do we indicate that we want to use an array result as an index key vs using each member of the array as a key\r\n  - How do we support composition of different functions to produce a result\r\n  - jq has nice answers to these questions already\r\n- CouchDB users are likely to be familiar with jq so it's one less thing to learn, and they can experiment with it in their shell while designing their indexes\r\n- It's very concise, compare `.foo | split(\" \") | .[]` to our `{ \"$explode\": { \"$field\": \"foo\", \"$separator\": \" \" } }`, which doesn't address the array vs elements problem\r\n\r\nThat said, there is risk with adopting a native dependency and we fully understand if that's not a path others think we should go down. We're opening this to gauge interest in the idea of indexing on dynamic functions inside Mango, rather than whether we use jq specifically.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe Python test script included in the PR indicates how to use the functionality. You may need to augment the rebar script to add build flags for your environment; this was developed on macOS with `jq` installed via Homebrew.\r\n\r\nIf we developed this further for production, we would want to add comprehensive unit tests for the `couch_jq` module to make sure it round-trips all JSON values correctly (I have verified this by hand but not written automated tests as such).\r\n\r\nIf we decide to stick with jq then we should also fuzz-test the native code, and we should decide whether to vendor the `jq` codebase or compile against the system copy.\r\n\r\nThere are also some warts in the implementation such as the addition of the virtual field into results based on the selector, which we'd need to come up with a cleaner solution for.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

a rare, unsupported scenario, a user can call _bulk_docs with\r\n`new_edits:false` and a VDU that denies the update of certain documents.\r\nWhen nodes are out of sync (under load and mem3_repl can't keep up),\r\nan update may or may not update the revision tree.\r\n\r\nWhen two nodes extend the revision tree and forbids the update,\r\nbut one node is behind, an `{error, W, [{Doc, FirstReply} | Acc]}`\r\nis returned instead of `{ok, _}` or `{accepted, _}`. The _bulk_docs\r\nrequest does not accept {error, _} which leads to a function_clause.\r\n\r\nThis fix changes the return value to:\r\n`{accepted, W, [{Doc, {forbidden, Msg}} | Acc]}`\r\nwhen any of the nodes forbids the update.\r\n\r\nUpdating one document is also addressed so if the same issue occurs\r\nduring one document update, a 403 is still returned.\r\n\r\nThis should not affect replication since replication understands\r\nforbidden return values and should ignore the update respectively.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR has a small improvement to the Elixir test suite, and adds the `credo` style check earlier in the pipeline. It also reconfigures the per-stage timeouts so that they ignore time spent in the build queue waiting for a docker-based agent to free up.\r\n\r\nFinally, it refactors the pipeline to use a larger number of explicit steps in each stage. This improves the developer experience navigating the Jenkins UI, as we can see timings for each phase of the build, and if a step fails the logs that are displayed will be scoped just to that step.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nJenkins\r\n\r\n## Related PRs\r\n\r\n#3895 was the first PR to convert the Jenkinsfile to use specific images for each Erlang

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is one of those situations where you go in to make a small change, see an opportunity for some refactoring, and get sucked into a rabbit hole that leaves you wondering if you have any idea how computers actually work. My initial goal was simply to update the Erlang version used in our binary packages to a modern supported release. Along the way I decided I wanted to figure out how to eliminate all the copypasta we generate for making any change to this file, and after a few days of hacking here we are. This rewrite has the following features:\r\n    \r\n* Updates to use Debian 11 (current stable) as the base image for building releases and packaging repos.\r\n    \r\n* Defaults to Erlang 24.2 as the embedded Erlang version in packages.\r\n    \r\n* Dynamically generates the parallel build stages used to test and package CouchDB on various OSes. This is accomplished through a bit of scripted pipeline code that relies on two new methods defined at the beginning of the Jenkinsfile, one for \"native\" builds on macOS and FreeBSD and one for container-based builds. See comments in the code for additional details.\r\n    \r\n* Expands commands like `make check` into a series of steps to improve visibility. The Jenkins UI will now show the time spent in each step of the build process, and if a step (e.g. `make eunit`) fails it will only expand the logs for that step by default instead of showing the logs for the entire build stage. The downside is that if we do make changes to the series of targets underneath `check` we need to remember to update the Jenkinsfile as well.\r\n\r\n* Changes the 15m timeout for the 'Build Release Tarball' stage to only start *after* the agent has been acquired. Previously builds could fail if they sat in the build queue for more than 10 minutes, as Jenkins' [defined behavior](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent) for a stage-level timeout is that it starts before the agent is acquired. I don't think that's what we want in this case.\r\n\r\n## Review recommendations\r\n\r\nSee https://ci-couchdb.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FFullPlatformMatrix/activity?branch=jenkins-dynamic-matrix for the builds associated with this branch.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to hear any objections to using Erlang 24 for packages. I think it makes sense at least for `main`. A 3.x version of this might want to be more conservative and use the latest version where we can confirm support for full-text integration.\r\n\r\nI'm particularly interested in any objections to the overall strategy of using the scripted pipeline block. I like the Declarative Pipeline syntax, and I tried _really_ hard to find a way to achieve the goal of a DRY Jenkinsfile in a purely declarative fashion. At one point I designed a Matrix with a list of exclusions and conditionals that would cause stages to be skipped, but the UX was a significant step backwards from what we had today and I eventually gave up on it.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nI noticed a few additional areas for improvement but figured they should be follow-on contributions:\r\n\r\n* `make erlfmt-check` takes ~5 minutes, which seems entirely too long. I suspect there's a way to refactor the Python code underneath that target to be more efficient in the way that it invokes the underlying `erlfmt` tool.\r\n* Each stage starts with a clean SCM checkout or release tarball, and has to run `./configure` as a result. I'd expect that running configure on a release tarball with `--skip-deps` would be ~instantaneous, but it still takes ~30 seconds. Might be worth investigating.","created_at":"2022-01-18T17:19:30Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T13:58:48Z","closed_at":"2022-01-20T03:37:44Z","merged_at":"2022-01-20T03:37:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b6454b81ca1a599da1f538548dc67654b6ce8d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/28cd525dbfd423985fd5edd386c12358caf90fb7","head":{"label":"apache:jenkins-dynamic-matrix","ref":"jenkins-dynamic-matrix","sha":"28cd525dbfd423985fd5edd386c12358caf90fb7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR switches away from using a single container image with multiple Erlang versions installed via kerl and instead uses specific images for each version of Erlang against which we want to test a PR.\r\n\r\nIt also relies on tags like '20', '21' ... '24' instead of specific Erlang versions, so we can push updated images with new patch releases without needing to also file a PR to modify the Jenkinsfile configuration. The \"Update Docker Containers\" Jenkins job may need a small tweak to ensure that we can pick up the updated images behind those tags.\r\n\r\nThe matrix we are testing PRs against after this change looks like\r\n\r\n| Erlang | OS | Elixir | JS |\r\n|-------|-------|-----| ------ |\r\n| 20.3.8.26 | Debian 10 (Buster) | v1.9.4 | 60 |\r\n| 21.3.8.24 | Debian 11 (Bullseye) | v1.11.4 | 78 |\r\n| 22.3.4.24 | Debian 11 (Bullseye) | v1.12.3 | 78 | \r\n| 23.3.4.10 | Debian 11 (Bullseye) | v1.12.3 | 78 |\r\n| 24.2 | Debian 11 (Bullseye) | v1.12.3 | 78 |\r\n\r\nI _could_ hack in better support for Erlang 20 on Debian 11 but didn't bother. I encountered linker errors out of the box on Erlang 20 with gcc 10, and figured this was just one more reason to move towards dropping support for it rather than hacking in conditional usage of gcc 9 and/or putting in special linker flags (`-fcommon` probably would have done it).\r\n\r\n## Testing

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently, `decode/3` performs various checks on a JWT, and then\r\nbase64 decodes and finally JSON decodes the token. However, in some\r\ncases, it's desirable to skip the decoding steps, and just return the\r\ntoken payload in binary form.\r\n\r\nThis exposes `decode/4` where the 4th argument is a decoder fun that\r\ndefaults to `decode_b64url_json/1` for `decode/3` to retain existing\r\nbehavior, but also exposes `decode_passthrough/1` in case a client\r\nwants to avoid any decoding steps.\r\n\r\n<!--

`libicu` collator versions were not tracked, and during major OS version upgrades it was possible to experience apparent data loss due to collation order differences between `libicu` library versions. The view order inconsistency would last until the view would get compacted.\r\n\r\n#### Solution Summary\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to start tracking collator versions in the view header, and  then, automatically submit the views for compaction, such that the keys are re-ordered according the current collator's sorting rules only.\r\n\r\nThe implementation discussion for this feature was conducted on the [dev mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread/rqfwrt4kszz79l3wxxtg6zwygz6my8p2). Some design trade-offs were discussed there and some in the PR comments below.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThe `libicu` library can return an opaque collator version from `ucol_getVersion()`, which encodes parts of the base UCA version and any custom tailorings which could affect collation. That version is exposed from the ejson comparison NIF and then is saved in the view header in a new view info map field.\r\n\r\nThe view info map is re-using a previously removed view header field from `2.x` views. The upgrade logic from `2.x` to `3.x` already ignores that header field, and this allows for simple downgrading back to `3.2.1`, and then upgrading back to a current version, all while keeping the same view signature.\r\n \r\nIf there is no collator version recorded in the view header, the first time the view is opened, the header will be upgraded to record the current libicu version. It's possible to avoid immediately writing the upgraded header and instead delaying till the next view data update with this setting:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[view_upgrade]\r\ncommit_on_header_upgrade = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe list of collator version is also returned in the `_design/*/_info` response. This lets users track when the view has more than one libicu collator versions. Additionally, in order to be able to match those with the current versions of the libicu library on each node, the opaque collator version is returned from the `_node/*/_versions` endpoint.\r\n\r\nViews which have more than one collator versions are submitted for re-compaction to the `upgrade_views` channel. This behavior is triggered both on update (which is the typical smoosh trigger mechanism), and when opened. Triggering on open is intended to be used with read-only views, which may not be updated after libicu upgrades, and so would perpetually emit inconsistent data.\r\n\r\nAutomatic re-compaction may be disabled with a config setting:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[view_upgrade]\r\ncompact_on_collator_upgrade = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default value is `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\nIn order to test view upgrades from various previous versions, a few view fixture files are added with old versions and a (bogus) collator version to simulate upgrading the libicu scenario. The tests are grouped in a separate commit and the should test for these scenarios:\r\n * A 2.x view can upgraded to have a view info map\r\n * A 3.2.1 view can be upgraded to have a view info map\r\n * A view with multiple collator versions:\r\n   - Can be opened and tagged with the current libicu version\r\n   - Can be queried, written to and then queried again\r\n   - Will be submitted for compaction when open and on updates\r\n   - After compaction the view will have only one collator version\r\n\r\n#### Reviewer Notes\r\n\r\n  * The PR is grouped as few commits to make it easier to review, and individual commit messages might have extra details about those particular updates\r\n  * While there are some upgrade tests from previous view versions, there is no downgrade test, so that would have to be performed manually. Here is a sample script and instructions to help with that:\r\n     - Start on 3.x and create a view. Something like this could work: ```http delete $DB/colltest1 && http put $DB/colltest1'?q=1' && http put $DB/colltest1/_design/colltest1ddoc views:='{\"colltest1view\":{\"map\":\"function(doc){emit(doc.id, null);}\"}}' && http put $DB/colltest1/d1 a=b && http put $DB/colltest1/d2 c=d```\r\n     - Query the view `http $DB/colltest1/_design/colltest1ddoc/_view/colltest1view` and then wait 5+ seconds to commit.\r\n     - Check its signature: `http $DB/colltest1/_design/colltest1ddoc/_info`\r\n     - Switch to the PR branch. Query view again and check its signature. Update the db with a few more docs and query it again and wait to commit. This ensures the view header is written with the new view info map header field.\r\n     - Check its signature: `http $DB/colltest1/_design/colltest1ddoc/_info`. It should stay there same. The collator version should appear there as well. \r\n     - Switch back to 3.x Query the view again and check its signature. Update the db with more doc and query again, verifying that a downgraded view can be queried and updated.\r\n     - Check its signature: `http $DB/colltest1/_design/colltest1ddoc/_info`\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen getting the distribution stats, we get a list of all the connected nodes that we then loop over to get the statistics. While looping, one of the nodes can become unresponsive or offline during that check which results in `{error, einval}`. This will be more of an issue on larger clusters as there is more of a time window for the initial acquisition of open sockets and the iteration of checking each.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nWe specify two config variables under query_server_config called partition_query_limit and query_limit. These are not enforced in the code since https://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/b2f9cfaceb121bf391f25e5edc51ad75b71967b4 was merged in response to issue https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2795.\r\n\r\nThe right fix is to move the enforcement to later in the mango execution sequence.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we

Overview\r\n\r\nSince Erlang 19.0 there is an [ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/compile.html#env_compiler_options-0) environment variable which the compiler will consult.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun `make clean && ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS='[no_line_info,deterministic,no_debug_info]' make`.\r\nCapture module-info from some module (something like `couch_db:module_info(compile).` perhaps). Then, run `make clean && make` and see if the changes took effect. With `no_debug_info` there should be almost no extra info shown.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nRemove ERL_OPTS handling from rebar.config* scripts: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3841\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are

Overview\r\n\r\nSince Erlang 19.0 there is an [ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/compile.html#env_compiler_options-0) environment variable which the compiler will consult.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun `make clean && ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS='[no_line_info,deterministic,no_debug_info]' make`.\r\nCapture module-info from some module (something like `couch_db:module_info(compile).` perhaps). Then, run `make clean && make` and see if the changes took effect. With `no_debug_info` there should be almost no extra info shown.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nRemove ERL_OPTS handling from rebar.config* scripts:

Summary\r\n\r\n * Fix quoting so that it works with all OTP versions 20 through 24 [1].\r\n\r\n * Dist API in 20 [2] did not have a `listen/2` [3] callback. Implement\r\n   `listen/1` so we're compatible with all the supported OTP versions.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3821#issuecomment-985089867\r\n[2] https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/maint-20/lib/kernel/src/inet_tcp_dist.erl#L71-L72\r\n[3] https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/lib/kernel/src/inet_tcp_dist.erl#L79-L80\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n * Follow the nice instructions by @jiahuili430 [here](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/3821#issuecomment-985089867). Try with Erlang 20 and then 23, for example.\r\n\r\nMy setup with 20 looked like:\r\n\r\nvm.args:\r\n```\r\n-proto_dist couch\r\n-couch_dist no_tls '\"clouseau@127.0.0.1\"'\r\n-couch_dist no_tls '\"node1@127.0.0.1\"'\r\n-ssl_dist_optfile \"/...../asf-3/dev/couch_ssl_dist.conf\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nremsh to node 2\r\n```\r\n./dev/remsh-tls 2\r\n(node2@127.0.0.1)1> net_kernel:nodes_info().\r\n{ok,[{'node3@127.0.0.1',\r\n         [{owner,<0.399.0>},\r\n          {state,up},\r\n          {address,{net_address,{{127,0,0,1},53431},\"xxxx\",proxy,inet}},\r\n          {type,normal},\r\n          {in,123},\r\n          {out,137}]},\r\n     {'node1@127.0.0.1',\r\n         [{owner,<0.369.0>},\r\n          {state,up},\r\n          {address,\r\n              {net_address,{{127,0,0,1},53429},\"127.0.0.1\",tcp,inet}},\r\n          {type,normal},\r\n          {in,177},\r\n          {out,145}]},\r\n     {'remsh29344@127.0.0.1',\r\n         [{owner,<0.1095.0>},\r\n          {state,up},\r\n          {address,{net_address,{{127,0,0,1},53431},\"xxxx\",proxy,inet}},\r\n          {type,hidden},\r\n          {in,8},\r\n          {out,10}]}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two minor things to watch out for when testing:\r\n\r\n * In Erlang 20 TLS dist works a bit differently -- there is a `proxy` driver module, so TLS connections in `net_kernel:nodes_info/0` show up as `proxy` instead of `tls`. That's expected.\r\n \r\n * Because connections between nodes are bi-directional, when we set `node1` to be TCP, we're not guaranteed to always get a TCP connection to it, as, for example, `node1` could first connect to `node2`  and node2 doesn't have a `no_tls` flag so it will be a TLS connection. But after a few tries we should get a TCP connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-06T22:58:07Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T21:33:51Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T21:33:47Z","merged_at":"2021-12-08T21:33:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"728f3b936b2eb7f9572ebf90d6887a3c2849f571","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/53197e5e6449a3b61bfe4a706f240c4f1afa4585","head":{"label":"apache:fix-couch-dist-for-erlang-20","ref":"fix-couch-dist-for-erlang-20","sha":"53197e5e6449a3b61bfe4a706f240c4f1afa4585","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces spidermonkey 91esr. As with 78 and 86 there are no relevant API changes but it became necessary in practice as well as in theory to destroy the context and shutdown JS before any proper exit to prevent assertions in destructors. (For more information, the issue tracking the esr91 migration guide is [here](https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/spidermonkey-embedding-examples/issues/41.)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSince many distributions don't ship with moz-js 91 yet, I've included a github workflow to test couchdb in ubuntu with the latest spidermonkey, foundationdb 6.x, and icu. It is set to be manually run on a branch from the actions menu.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories

`erlfmt` formatting to 3.x\r\n\r\nFrom PR: #3568\r\n\r\nA few changes to the formatting logic compared to `main`:\r\n\r\n * rebar3 and `erlfmt` don't work with Erlang 20, so added an OTP version check to skip formatting for Erlang 20\r\n\r\n * `make erlfmt-*` commands are faster. Instead of spawning an `erlfmt` process per-file, spawn one per `directory/*.erl` pattern.\r\n\r\n * Remove the non-0 return code work-around. `erlfmt` was returning an error on `main` because the line width option used for formatting was different than the one used during format checking. Making both use the default value removes all the spurious non-0 exit with the current version of `erlfmt`. Thanks to Adam   Kocoloski for pointing out the issue.\r\n\r\nThe pull request is split into two commits - the first one sets up the tooling and the second one performs the formatting.\r\n\r\nIn the second, formatting commit, these exception from main were ported over as is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- a/src/chttpd/src/chttpd.erl\r\n+++ b/src/chttpd/src/chttpd.erl\r\n@@ -491,6 +491,7 @@

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is really just trying to simply our Makefile, reducing target overlap and removing unnecessary environment declarations and dependencies. I also restored `python-black` as a required check and reformatted our Python code accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n* `make check` covers everything changed here\r\n* `make elixir-suite` has been streamlined a bit but still runs the full integration suite\r\n* `make elixir-check-formatted`, `make elixir-credo`, and `make elixir-integration` can all be run independently. They no longer depend on `elixir-init`, so if you're working on a clean instance `mix` will ask you if you want to install rebar etc. locally (and you can just accept the default)\r\n* `make mango-test` also saw a few small changes.\r\n\r\n## Reviewer Guidance\r\n\r\nThe commits are meant to be reviewed individually. Most are quite straightforward, but looking at the diff in its entirety can make it more difficult to figure out some of the substance. Other noteworthy bits:\r\n\r\n* I removed the `TEST_OPTS` variable -- does anyone use it at all? Inside the Makefile it was being used to inject some .ini config settings; I moved those to an appropriate `test-config.ini` file.\r\n* The `suite.elixir` file was a bit outdated, so I rebuilt it. I also renamed two tests that were being accidentally excluded from the suite.\r\n* The `skip.elixir` file was skipping several tests that actually pass, and was not excluding any tests that were not already marked with a `pending` tag. I zeroed out the skip file in this PR and left a comment that it could be used if one wanted to exclude tests without tagging them directly in the codebase.\r\n\r\n## Discussion Topic\r\n\r\nI find it a little janky to have to keep `suite.elixir` manually up-to-date. Should we find a way to automate that? I found quite a few instances in today's work where we were not running tests that we ought to have been running. Conversely, do we actually need to keep the suite / skip approach to managing test sets? ExUnit always has a fairly rich tagging and filtering system for constructing test sets. I wouldn't mind at all if e.g. Cloudant folks wanted to add some additional tags to tests so they could exclude / include them as needed for their internal CI setup.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a rebase of #3175, updated to skip additional incompatible elixir tests for \"couchapp\" functionality that have been added in the interim.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug on `main` right now where the `_users` DB cannot be recreated once it has been deleted, and the cluster is rendered completely inoperable until CouchDB restarts. That's the reason for d8eea48 (and, I believe, for Paul's exclusion of other tests in that module). I've called that out separately so we can revert that commit once the fix is found.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in consolidating the `elixir`, `elixir-only`, and `elixir-suite` into a single target I'm all ears. The first two are identical save for the `MIX_ENV` and `COUCHDB_TEST_ADMIN_PARTY_OVERRIDE` environment settings, so I'm guessing we only need one target. The last one uses a skip file instead of the `@pending` tag; I could certainly imagine going that route but stuck with @davisp 's original approach for this PR at this time.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make elixir`\r\n\r\nFor me this yields\r\n\r\n> Finished in 86.2 seconds\r\n440 tests, 0 failures, 136 excluded, 1 skipped\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#3175\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in

appropriately named `hack_local_ini` function in dev/run lives up\r\nto its name by adding a random `secret` to the end of whichever\r\nsection contains the line `\"; require_valid_user = false\\n\"`.\r\n\r\n[Recent commits](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3808) updated the `setup` application from\r\n`couch_httpd_auth` to `chttpd_auth` without also changing this line\r\nin local.ini, which had the fun effect of causing `setup` to fail with\r\nthis error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] 2021-10-30T18:50:15.019274Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.817.0> 85d0421b9c setup sync_admin results

with custodian working finally, it also started to emit false positive errors in the logs for dbs with `N` < cluster default `N`. We fix that in a separate commit where, instead of the cluster default N value we use each database's expected N value.\r\n\r\nThe expected N value is a bit tricky to understand since with shard splitting feature, shard ranges are not guaranteed to exactly match for all copies. The `N` value is then defined as the max number of rings which can be completed with the given set of shards -- complete the ring once, remove participating shards, try again, etc. Lucky for us, that function is already written as `mem3_util:calculate_max_n/2` so we are just re-using

this flaky test show up in a few recent test runs, for [example](https://ci-couchdb.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FPullRequests/detail/PR-3799/1/pipeline)\r\n\r\nThe test was flaky as We were only waiting for the replication task or scheduler job to appear in the list but didn't not wait until the value of the task had been updated to an expected value. So the task might have appeared but then only half the docs written (say, 5 instead of 10). Testing the value at that stage is too early and the test would fail.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, besides waiting on the task/job to appear in the list, also wait until its `docs_written` value matches the expected value. By that point `docs_read` should have caught up as well.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-25T02:45:41Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T03:31:07Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T03:30:59Z","merged_at":"2021-10-25T03:30:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"56f4817f62189ca599ba54b106be6bb5316453f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b5a90b82ba36f5881114fe81b156c7a42d7e1a61","head":{"label":"apache:fix-flaky-replicator-stats-test","ref":"fix-flaky-replicator-stats-test","sha":"b5a90b82ba36f5881114fe81b156c7a42d7e1a61","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nSometimes, a clouseau index may become out of sync with the db or\r\nbecome corrupt under certain conditions (heap exhaustion, garbage collection).\r\nThis leads to certain HitIds that get returned which may not exist\r\nin the current db. Before this fix, we assume the Hit's Id will\r\nautomatically match an Id returned from:\r\n\r\n`\r\nfabric:all_docs(DbName, fun callback/2, [], [{keys, DocIds}, {include_docs, true}]).\r\n`\r\n\r\nWhen the document does not exist, `{error, false}` is returned for the row.\r\nThis fix  accounts for this scenario and possible other scenarios\r\nby returning an error to the user and also logging the error when the\r\nHit Id does not match what is returned from the _all_docs call.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to implement a read-repair solution but I don't think that it's possible without rebuilding the index.\r\nNote that this issue surfaced when a user ran similar queries across several databases with similar documents and indexes. One of the queries resulted in a document id being returned in a Hit that the user claims belongs to another database. That caused the `case_clause`. A rebuild of the index resolved the issue temporarily but surfaced again as heap levels reached max capacity again.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nUnit test added for possible error scenarios. Current regression tests should pass.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those

means `update_seq` values from `GET $db` `last_seq` returned from ` GET $db/_changes?since=now&limit=` will be more resilient to change feed rewinds. Besides, those sequences will now be more consistent and users won't have to wonder why one opaque sequence works slightly differently than another opaque update sequence.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when the sequences were returned only as numeric values, it was impossible to calculate replacements and change feeds had to always rewind back to 0 for those ranges. With uuids and epochs in play, it is possible to figure out that some shards might have moved to new nodes or find internal replication checkpoints to avoid streaming changes feeds from 0 on those ranges.\r\n\r\nSome replication Elixir tests decode update sequences, so those were updated to handle the new uuid and epoch format as well.\r\n\r\nFixes:

Overview\r\n\r\nOur existing logic for handling rewinds in the changes feed addresses the following cases:\r\n\r\n- A node that contributed to a sequence is in maintenance mode\r\n- A shard that contributed to a sequence has been split\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for cases where the node that contributed to a client-supplied sequence is down at the beginning of the request handling. It reuses the same logic as the maintenance mode case as these two situations really ought to be handled the same way.\r\n\r\nA future improvement would be to unify the \"node down\" and \"shard split\" logic so that we could handle the compound case, e.g. replacing a shard from a down node with a pair of shards from nodes that cover the same range.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCreate a DB in a multi-node cluster with N>1 and load e.g. 1000 documents into it.\r\nQuery the changes feed and grab the final sequence `S0`.\r\nDecode the sequence to see which node(s) contributed to the feed.\r\nShut down one of those nodes.\r\nQuery the feed again with `?since=S0`:\r\n- Without this patch it should rewind some of the shards to 0 and replay their entries.\r\n- With this patch it should report no new changes.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes #3788\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [
