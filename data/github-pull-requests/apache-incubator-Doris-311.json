Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nMaster replica will notify slave replicas through local brpc port (default `8070`) for single replica load. If the brpc port of single replica load are inconsistent between different BE, the function of single replica load will get into trouble. It's necessary to report brpc port of single replica load to FE so that master replica would know accurate brpc port of BE that slave replica locates on during generating load plan.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nParse parquet data with dictionary encoding.\r\n\r\nUsing the `PLAIN_DICTIONARY` enum value is deprecated in the Parquet 2.0 specification.\r\nPrefer using `RLE_DICTIONARY` in a data page and `PLAIN` in a dictionary page for Parquet 2.0+ files.\r\nrefer: https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/Encodings.md\r\n\r\n## Unit tests\r\n- `./be/test/exec/test_data/parquet_scanner/type-decoder.parquet` is a parquet file with all primitive types supported by hive and is encoded in plain.\r\n- `./be/test/exec/test_data/parquet_scanner/type-decoder.txt` is the text data the same as type-decoder.parquet, and is used as the compared data.\r\n- `./be/test/exec/test_data/parquet_scanner/dict-decoder.parquet` is a parquet file with all primitive types supported by hive and is encoded in dictionary.\r\n- `./be/test/exec/test_data/parquet_scanner/dict-decoder.txt` is the text data the same as dict-decoder.parquet, and is used as the compared data.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nDictionary encoding is triggered only when there is a large amount of duplicate data, so the rows in dict-decoder.txt are all the same to trigger dictionary encoding.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Instead, use its children' tuple info instead. The hash join node set the output slot's nullable info based on its children' tuple info. So if the child is cross join node, hash join node should check if the cross join node's tuples is out joined, then can set the slots nullable info correctly.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #11968\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe reservation tracker is not actually used, resulting in:\r\n1. Uncontrollable DCHECK failure\r\n2. Exceed mem limit that is not easy to understand\r\n\r\nEffects of removing reservation tracker:\r\n1. no vec partition agg is no longer limited by using the buffer pool cache.\r\n2. the spill of no vec partition agg is not enabled, so it will not affect the execution logic.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-22T11:04:02Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T06:20:35Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T00:49:35Z","merged_at":"2022-08-24T00:49:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"1fc5515a780a00ad96644ab92a46e83c57621ea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"BiteTheDDDDt","id":7939630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzk2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7939630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt","html_url":"https://github.com/BiteTheDDDDt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BiteTheDDDDt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2007350519,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDA3MzUwNTE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/storage/in-memory","name":"area/storage/in-memory","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues
