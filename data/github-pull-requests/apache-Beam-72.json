of #18204\r\n\r\nHadoopFormatIO, CdapIO, SparkReceiveIO are running performance tests on relatively small dataset (600k) which take only several seconds. The metrics obtained is thus barely meaningful to detect any regression / comparing performances. Bumping them to 5M, the same number used for JdbcIO performance tests. These tests all used the same TestRow so they are processing exactly same data and their metrics are now comparable.\r\n\r\nAdjusted the run interval from 6 h to 12 h as they do not need to run that frequently.\r\n\r\nAlso add SingleStoreIO dashboard which is almost done; and some fixes on Python dashboard.\r\n\r\n* CdapIO, SparkReceiver Performance test match data size for JDBC\r\n\r\n* Set frequency to 12 h (performance tests not need to exercise very frequent)\r\n\r\n* Add SingleStoreIO dashboard\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change enables the use of AVRO GenericRecord as part of the BigQueryIO storage write implementation (consistent and at-least-once). \r\n\r\nWhen using AVRO GenericRecord as the transport object in their pipelines, users need to configure the use of Beam schemas in the BigQueryIO to transform their data into Beam Rows first, or provide a format function to transform into TableRow, to then have their data formatted as DynamicMessage protos for BQ StorageWrite to work. This PR enables the users to provide a schema (BQ TableSchema, dyn destination or schema from view) and an AvroRowFactoryWriter to have their data transformed to GenericRecord and then StorageWrite compatible protos. \r\n\r\nWhen using GenericRecord as the input type for the PCollection, providing the identity function should be sufficient and inexpensive for their data ingestion. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

splits the Python PreCommit into several suites. While the primary goal is debuggability, I used duration and test suites as a proxy for splitting things evenly, and this does have the tangential benefit of reducing our longest precommit to ~40 minutes (from ~80 minutes). This is the breakdown of the split, along with the number of test classes and execution time of each subfolder*:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- `runners` - 70 test classes, 6h 1m 52s\r\n- `transforms` - 26 test classes, 4h 16m 56s\r\n- `dataframe` - 11 test classes, 67m 55s\r\n- `examples` - 68 test classes, 54m 38s\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAll items below have been left in the main precommit. They add up to 73 test classes, 38m 184s of tests\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n- `typehints` - 12 test classes, 23m 5s\r\n- `./*.py` - 2 test classes, 19m 1s\r\n- `testing` - 12 test classes, 8m 29s\r\n- `ml` - 15 test classes, 5m 54s\r\n- `utils` - 14 test classes, 1m 17s\r\n- `coders` 9 test classes, 1m 10s\r\n- `options` - 3 test classes, 39s\r\n- `tools` - 1 test class, 25s\r\n- `internal` - 7 test classes, 5s\r\n- `portability` - 0 test classes, 0s\r\n- `./*.py` - 2 test classes, 19m 1s\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note that tests are run in parallel, so in reality its much faster than the time values above.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

over some SplunkIO options (`enableGzipHttpCompression` and `enableBatchLogs`) from the SplunkIO implementation in DataflowTemplates [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/blob/main/v1/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/teleport/splunk/SplunkIO.java), so that DataflowTemplates can use Beam's SplunkIO implementation (there is an inconsistency in that classic templates use the DataflowTemplates implementation while flex templates use Beam's implementation, and Beam's implementation seems to be missing some options).\r\n\r\nThe `rootCaCertificatePath` option will be done in a separate PR, since adding that option will require more changes than the above two options.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

support fine-grained access control (FGAC) for Spanner Change Streams, we've added a database role to the Spanner config.  When the user sets the database role, Spanner will verify that the role has appropriate permissions to, for example, read the change stream.  Since Spanner Change Streams are split into multiple partitions that are read independently, Beam stores partition read progress information into a metadata database table.  This table is created by the Beam framework and is transparent to the user.  However, the Spanner Config that the user creates is not only used to access the primary database that contains the change stream, but it is also used to access the metadata database.  This is problematic when the user specifies a database role because the role is used to access the metadata table and since it hasn't been granted access to the table, the operation fails with an error like the following:\r\n```\r\nPERMISSION_DENIED: Role test_role does not have required privileges on table CDC_Partitions_Metadata_testdbchangestreams_580294176_5b5541dd_ebd9_4b68_8053_7978b9448a02\r\n```\r\nThis commit fixes the problem by stripping the database role from the metadata Spanner Config used to access the metadata tables.\r\nR: @pabloem

[gradle-docker-compose-plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin) from 0.14.12 to 0.16.11.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/releases\">gradle-docker-compose-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.16.11</h2>\n<p>Project name lowercased <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/386\">#386</a></p>\n<h2>0.16.10</h2>\n<p>Performance optimization <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/382\">#382</a></p>\n<h2>0.16.9</h2>\n<p>The level of a log message changed from lifecycle to info.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null to fallback to Docker default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null or empty value to reset to default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>New Gradle Publish plugin used</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>MacOS-specific defaults for executable and dockerExecutable removed</h2>\n<p>The defaults used to be <code>/usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code> and <code>/usr/local/bin/docker</code>, now it is just plain <code>docker-compose</code> and <code>docker</code> (for all platforms).</p>\n<h2>isRequiredBy changed in order not to break configuration avoidance</h2>\n<p>This release changes the behavior of <code>isRequiredBy</code> so the <code>Up</code> tasks should be executed as the last dependency of the configured task. Till now, we have this optimization for <code>classes</code> tasks only.</p>\n<p>As reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/352\">#352</a></p>\n<h2>Custom project name propagated correctly</h2>\n<p><code>projectName</code> property wasn't properly used due to a bug introduced in <code>0.16.0</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem was that the property was declared as a plain <code>String</code> instead of <code>Provider&lt;String&gt;</code>, so a change to the original value wasn't propagated to <code>ComposeExecutor</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>dockerExecutor initialized before used</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114815875\">reported</a>, it could happen that <code>dockerExecutor</code> was used before it was initialized. This release fixes this potential issue.</p>\n<h2>Tasks registration fixed</h2>\n<p>It is possible to get <code>A dependency must not be empty</code> error with <code>0.16.0</code> version of the plugin. This release should solve this issue (reported <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114623955\">here</a>).</p>\n<h2>Gradle Configuration Cache support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/351\">#351</a></p>\n<h2>Dots in default project name replaced</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/347\">#347</a></p>\n<h2>Services with dashes supported correctly</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/345\">#345</a></p>\n<h2>Docker Compose V2 support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/339\">avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin#339</a> thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/simondwilliams\"><code>@​simondwilliams</code></a></p>\n<h2>Gradle Plugin Portal publishing fixed</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

However the schema is returned as a proto TableSchema. The current sink creates the proto descriptor directly from the input type (either Beam schema or json TableSchema), which is problematic as the new proto descriptor must be compatible with the old one. This PR refactors the sink to always use the proto TableSchema when constructing a descriptor.\r\n\r\nNote: this may increase message size slightly for some schemas. e.g. for a Beam schema with a INT32 field, we currently generate an int32 proto field. However BigQuery schemas themselves don't have int32 fields, only int64 fields. So roundtripping through TableSchema means that we will now generate an int64 proto field instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the old schema-update code in preparation for the new version.

\"log\" attribute changed to \"logger\". This partially addresses https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22893.\r\n\r\nThere is a remaining issue I can see that is a side effect of the bug fix in https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/482. The tests in `window_test.py` fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'EncodedFile' object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because dill 0.3.6 now is trying to pickle global variables, which includes instances from pytest that cannot be pickled (c.f. https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/482#issuecomment-1139017499). That comment suggests adding `recurse=True` to the `dumps` call, but I'm hesitant to do this myself because I don't fully understand the consequence.\r\n\r\nI need this change ASAP to unblock beam in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) after I updated dill (reported in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/200985). For context, nixpkgs only packages the latest version of each Python package. I will fetch this patch for now and disable the failing test until a more permanent solution is available.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to incorporate this, or feel free to close it in favor of vendoring.\r\n\r\nR: @ryanthompson591 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

addition to doing a copy edit of the notebooks, I did the following:\r\n\r\n- Removed the Beam RunInference button that some have at the top and replaced it with an inline link. The button isn't rendering correctly when the notebooks are imported to Devsite, and the it's not clear where the link in the button takes you.\r\n- Tried to fix the formatting of the licenses to match the multi model format, which renders correctly on devsite.\r\n- Fixed the headings in some notebooks so that they render correctly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds a Zstandard compressing coder, enabling users to modify the compression level (trading off compression ratio for compression speed) and use a custom dictionary to further compress hard to compress data.\r\n\r\nI've previously used SnappyCoder to reduce shuffle data volume when writing data to storage using FileIO, which helps reduce overall pipeline cost when running on Dataflow with Streaming Engine enabled. However, Snappy doesn't perform well on workloads which have small encoded payloads per element. Replacing Snappy with Zstandard and a custom dictionary helped me reduce a high volume workload with small elements from 350 bytes per element to 95 bytes per element.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a simple example of loading and executing a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) compiled function written in Rust within a Beam Go SDK DoFn.  Many Beam users express interest in running simple functions in their favorite language embedded within a Beam execution workload.  This example provides preliminary results that perhaps this is possible using [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero).\r\n\r\nRunning this example was tested on the Direct Runner, Flink

[gradle-docker-compose-plugin](https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin) from 0.14.12 to 0.16.10.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/releases\">gradle-docker-compose-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>0.16.10</h2>\n<p>Performance optimization <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/382\">#382</a></p>\n<h2>0.16.9</h2>\n<p>The level of a log message changed from lifecycle to info.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null to fallback to Docker default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>setProjectName accepts null or empty value to reset to default</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>New Gradle Publish plugin used</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n<h2>MacOS-specific defaults for executable and dockerExecutable removed</h2>\n<p>The defaults used to be <code>/usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code> and <code>/usr/local/bin/docker</code>, now it is just plain <code>docker-compose</code> and <code>docker</code> (for all platforms).</p>\n<h2>isRequiredBy changed in order not to break configuration avoidance</h2>\n<p>This release changes the behavior of <code>isRequiredBy</code> so the <code>Up</code> tasks should be executed as the last dependency of the configured task. Till now, we have this optimization for <code>classes</code> tasks only.</p>\n<p>As reported in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/352\">#352</a></p>\n<h2>Custom project name propagated correctly</h2>\n<p><code>projectName</code> property wasn't properly used due to a bug introduced in <code>0.16.0</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem was that the property was declared as a plain <code>String</code> instead of <code>Provider&lt;String&gt;</code>, so a change to the original value wasn't propagated to <code>ComposeExecutor</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>dockerExecutor initialized before used</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114815875\">reported</a>, it could happen that <code>dockerExecutor</code> was used before it was initialized. This release fixes this potential issue.</p>\n<h2>Tasks registration fixed</h2>\n<p>It is possible to get <code>A dependency must not be empty</code> error with <code>0.16.0</code> version of the plugin. This release should solve this issue (reported <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/351#issuecomment-1114623955\">here</a>).</p>\n<h2>Gradle Configuration Cache support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/351\">#351</a></p>\n<h2>Dots in default project name replaced</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/347\">#347</a></p>\n<h2>Services with dashes supported correctly</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/345\">#345</a></p>\n<h2>Docker Compose V2 support</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/pull/339\">avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin#339</a> thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/simondwilliams\"><code>@​simondwilliams</code></a></p>\n<h2>Gradle Plugin Portal publishing fixed</h2>\n<p>No release notes provided.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/e706eed6d6b7959050ebb87669c75760c52580d1\"><code>e706eed</code></a> feat: dc ps --services called only once (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/382\">#382</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/40349b36aa6b6786bb354469ab3b444b7576c16f\"><code>40349b3</code></a> chore(deps): update dependency gradle to v6.9.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/e7e10ca712a8f0f1bd68dc94dbafce1a178e5bc7\"><code>e7e10ca</code></a> fix(deps): update dependency org.yaml:snakeyaml to v1.33</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/ce9f866420fec7453d77cac13cdce015e7f7478c\"><code>ce9f866</code></a> fix(deps): update dependency org.yaml:snakeyaml to v1.32</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/8155c72073039e293b9bd43cfbe6e6f068a31662\"><code>8155c72</code></a> feat: difference between states logged as info instead of lifecycle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/9f7f19b426d9ee6a0acba6e485f4f83a215d3545\"><code>9f7f19b</code></a> fix(deps): update dependency org.yaml:snakeyaml to v1.31</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/c15bc180a5fbaa3aacac7643f50016dec4127e4d\"><code>c15bc18</code></a> feat: setProjectName accepts null to fallback to Docker default Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/362\">#362</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/33cb6711f485b11fee3879dbeaf8c0a6a9ff2fba\"><code>33cb671</code></a> feat: setProjectName accepts null or empty value as reset Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/362\">#362</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/9f0201937e0f1d8e378c9b14d101a351b632ce64\"><code>9f02019</code></a> docs: Kotlin example on projectName fixed Fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/issues/362\">#362</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/commit/c0958f74ed4ac82262cb890830417d2f356fb9fd\"><code>c0958f7</code></a> conf: Maven publishing fixed</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/avast/gradle-docker-compose-plugin/compare/0.14.12...0.16.10\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.avast.gradle:gradle-docker-compose-plugin&package-manager=gradle&previous-version=0.14.12&new-version=0.16.10)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

change also adds a BigQuery option that allows users to specify the initial number of Streams in a BQ Read API Session.\r\n\r\nCustomers using BEAM with BigQuery Read API experience errors (like `Root cause: The worker lost contact with the service`) whenever Dataflow decides to aggressively rebalance work items (i.e. calling `splitAtFraction()`). This change provides customers with an emergency mechanism that will allow pipelines experiencing a high volume of such errors to run to completion. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
