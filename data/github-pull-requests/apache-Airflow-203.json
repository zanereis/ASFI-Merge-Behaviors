on ##13556\r\n\r\nThe provider.yaml contains more information that required at\r\nruntime (specifically about documentation building). Those\r\nfields are not needed at runtime and their presence is optional.\r\nAlso the runtime check for provider information should be more\r\nrelexed and allow for future compatibility (with\r\nadditional properties set to false). This way we can add new,\r\noptional fields to provider.yaml without worrying about breaking\r\nfuture-compatibility of providers with future airflow versions.\r\n\r\nThis changei restores 'additionalProperties': false in the\r\nmain, development-focused provider.yaml schema and introduced\r\nnew runtime schema that is used to verify the provider info when\r\nproviders are discovered by airflow.\r\n\r\nThis 'runtime' version should change very rarely as change to\r\nadd a new required property in it breaks compatibility of\r\nproviders with already released versions of Airflow.\r\n\r\nWe also trim-down the provider.yaml file when preparing provider\r\npackages to only contain those fields that are required in the\r\nruntime schema.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

taskgroup decorator which can be used to create taskgroup from python callable. Inside python callable tasks can be grouped by calling tasks (python callable ) created with task decorator.\r\n\r\n\r\n- taskgroup decorator takes both optional and keyword argument which are passed to Constructor of TaskGroup class.\r\n\r\n- TaskGroup can be created with one of following syntax\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@taskgroup\r\n@taskgroup()\r\n@taskgroup(group_id='group_name')\r\n```\r\n\r\n- TaskGroup class  constructor takes one mandatory argument group_id, if not given in decorator it sets group_id to python callable name.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a simple example demonstrating use of taskgroup decorator grouping multiple tasks.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task\r\ndef task_1(value):\r\n  return f'[ Task1 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_2(value):\r\n  print(f'[ Task2 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n\r\n@taskgroup\r\ndef section_1(value):\r\n  return task_2(task_1(value))\r\n```\r\n\r\ntaskgroup decorator utilizes existing TaskGroup context manager currently used for creating TaskGroup, which means we can create nested taskgroup by created nested callable. Following is an example demonstrating use of nested taskgroup.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task\r\ndef task_start():\r\n    return '[Task_start]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_end():\r\n    print(f'[ Task_End ]')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_1(value):\r\n    return f'[ Task1 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_2(value):\r\n    print(f'[ Task2 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_3(value):\r\n    return f'[ Task3 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_4(value):\r\n    print(f'[ Task4 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n@taskgroup\r\ndef section_1(value):\r\n\r\n    @taskgroup\r\n    def section_2(value2):\r\n        return task_4(task_3(value2))\r\n\r\n    op1 = task_2(task_1(value))\r\n    return section_2(op1) \r\n```\r\n\r\nDedicated test cases for taskgroup decorator is created in file \r\n/tests/utils/test_task_group_decorator.py\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent changes \r\n\r\n- Added logic to append suffix to duplicate group_id.\r\n\r\ncloses: #11870\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-05T05:14:28Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T10:18:16Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T10:18:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc8568157cefdccaedf2f9f2e25f0573ff363f81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"houqp","id":670302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDMwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp","html_url":"https://github.com/houqp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color

of the earlier changes removed unneccessary pulling of the\r\n'build' segment from GitHub Registry in `ci_wait_for_prod_image.sh'.\r\nIt is not needed, because the K8S tests only use the final image\r\nand pulling the build image is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThis has the undesired effect that 'ci_wait_for_prod_image.sh' was\r\nalso used at the step where master image pushes the prod image\r\nto the repository as the 'latest' cache. In this case both - the\r\n'final' prod image and the 'build' segment should be pulled,\r\nbecause both are needed for PROD image build optimizations.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

additional properties should be allowed in provider schema,\r\notherwise future version of providers will not be compatible with\r\nolder versions of Airflow.\r\n\r\nSpecifying 'additionalProperties' as allowed we are opening up to\r\nadding more properties to provider.yaml.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes this is for now by removing extra fields\r\nadded since the Airlow 2.0.0 schema and verifying that the 2.0.0\r\nschema correctly validates such modified dictionary.\r\n\r\nIn the future we might deprecate 2.0.0 and add >=2.0.1 limitation\r\nto the provider packages in which case we will be able to remove\r\nthis modification of the provider_info dict.\r\n\r\nAlso added additional test for provider packages whether they\r\ninstall on Airflow 2.0.0. This tests might remain even after the\r\ndeprecation of 2.0.0 - we can just move it to 2.0.1. However this\r\nwill give us much bigger confidence that the providers will\r\ncontinue work even for older versions of Airflow 2.0.\r\n\r\nWe might have to modify that test and only include the providers\r\nthat are backwards-compatible, in case we have some providers\r\nthat depend on future Airflow versions. For now we assume\r\nall providers should be installable from master on 2.0.0.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

cannot skip installing providers, but this causes\r\nproblems when installing airflow in editable mode, because providers\r\nare in two places - in airflow sources and in provider packages.\r\n\r\nThis change removes installed provider packages when airflow\r\nis installed in editable mode to mitigate the problem.\r\n\r\nThis way, there is no need to use INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES\r\nvariable when installing in editable mode.\r\n\r\nWe still need to keep INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES for cases when\r\nnon-editable mode is used. In this way one can easily install curent\r\nversion of provider packages locally with pip install and have\r\nthe latest sources of both airflow and providers installed.\r\n\r\nAlso INSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES is particularly useful if you\r\ndevelop a new provider and reinstall airflow - because otherwise\r\nit will try to install the provider from a non-existing package.\r\n\r\nThis is why all regular CI jobs and Breeze have\r\nINSTALL_PROVIDERS_FROM_SOURCES set by default.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

has a sophisticated back-off mechanism when trying to connect\r\nand it causes sometimes that it hangs for a very long time\r\nwhen first few attempts to connect failed with a 'soft' error.\r\nSimilarly, when curl starts transfer after connecting but the\r\nother party hanged, the client curl call might hang as well.\r\n\r\nThis causes various problems for example sometimes waitig for\r\nimages in the ci build gets cancelled because curl command\r\nto check for image fails - example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/13413/checks?check_run_id=1635401914\r\n\r\nThis change adds appropriate timeouts to all curl commands we\r\nuse in CI/manual operations. In many cases we implemented\r\nretry so the effect will be that those cases will stop happening\r\nbut even in no-retry case, failing curl is better than hangs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

no airflow files change, selective tests only run basic\r\ntests, but this is wrong, because many of .py files are\r\noutside of the airflow folder.\r\n\r\nIn this case we should enable image building

that we are hitting more often one of the most favourite\r\nbugs by Ash: DNS. Quote: \"It's always DNS\".\r\n\r\nIt looks like there is a race condition with docker compose\r\nthat causes services that started fast enough (before DNS)\r\nto get a different reverse-DNS IP lookup (usually it is\r\njust `<SERVICE>` but sometimes it is\r\n`<DOCKER_COMPOSE_APP>_<SERVICE>_1_<NETWORK>`).\r\nThis produces misleading messages in log that might\r\nmake analysis of such problems difficult, that's why\r\nwe chose to get rid of the reverse lookup and give\r\nbigger time for each service to check if it is ready.\r\n\r\nNetcat, unfortunately performs both forward and reverse\r\nlookup when given a name - forward lookup to find the\r\nIP address and reverse lookup to write information to the\r\nlog about the host it connected to - and if it sees\r\nthat the original and reverse-looked-up names do not match\r\neven if it manages to connect, it retunrs an error:\r\n\r\n`DNS fwd/rev mismatch` - which is very misleading.\r\n\r\nThis change performs the following:\r\n\r\n1) We lookup the host name in python via gethostbyname\r\n2) We set -n in netcat to disable ANY DNS use\r\n3) We feed netcat with the IP address\r\n4) We've standardized all waiting times to be up to 50 seconds\r\n\r\nThis way we should get rid of the DNS fwd/rev mismatch once\r\nand for all.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

bash operator has dialed in how to run bash commands from python and airflow.\r\n\r\n There are other operators that sometimes need to do this.  But for various reasons, they might not want to inherit from BashOperator.  And in this case, it would be nice if there were a bash hook that would just let you run a bash command in your operator.\r\n\r\nWe can also imagine circumstances where perhaps within a single \"BashOperator\", maybe you want to run a _series_ of bash commands.  Well, if you have a hook that encapsulates this functionality, then this is very clean to implement.

PR improves building production image from local packages,\r\nin preparation for moving provider requirements out of setup.cfg.\r\n\r\nPreviously `pip download` step was executed in the CI scripts\r\nin order to download all the packages that were needed. However\r\nthis had two problems:\r\n\r\n1) PIP download was executed outside of Dockerfile in CI scripts\r\n   which means that any change to requirements there could not\r\n   be executed in 'workflow_run' event - because main branch version\r\n   of CI scripts is used there. We want to add extra requirements\r\n   when installing airflow so in order to be able to change\r\n   it, those requirements should be added in Dockerfile.\r\n   This will be done in the follow-up #13409 PR.\r\n\r\n2) Packages downloaded with PIP download have a \"file\" version\r\n   rather than regular == version when you run pip freeze/check.\r\n   This looks weird and while you can figure out the version\r\n   from file name, when you `pip install` them, they look\r\n   much more normal. The airflow package and provider package\r\n   will still get the \"file\" form but this is ok because we are\r\n   building those packages from sources and they are not yet\r\n   available in PyPI.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n  adal==1.2.5\r\n  aiohttp==3.7.3\r\n  alembic==1.4.3\r\n  amqp==2.6.1\r\n  apache-airflow @ file:///docker-context-files/apache_airflow-2.1.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl\r\n  apache-airflow-providers-amazon @ file:///docker-context-files/apache_airflow_providers_amazon-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl\r\n  apache-airflow-providers-celery @ file:///docker-context-files/apache_airflow_providers_celery-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl\r\n  ...\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we do not `pip download` all packages, but instead\r\nwe prepare airflow + providers packages as .whl files and\r\ninstall them from there (all the dependencies are installed\r\nfrom PyPI)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`skipped` task status can be useful when building dags for some trickier requirements.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds to `BashOperator` the capability to end the task in `skipped` state.\r\n\r\nIf the command exits with code 255, an `AirflowSkippedException` is thrown.\r\n\r\nIf you have a better suggestion re choice of exit code, suggest.  I chose 255 because I think it is pretty unlikely to be found in the wild, which means this would only be a \"breaking\" change in a negligible sense.\r\n\r\nIf we don't like exit codes for this, we could come up with some convention for parsing stdout.

on #13556 \r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the last commit only as it is based on #13422\r\nThis change removes the provider-imposed requirements from the\r\nairflow's setup.cfg to additional configuration in the\r\nbreeze/CI scripts. This does not change constraint apprach\r\nwhen installing airflow, the constraints to those versions\r\nremain as they were, but airflow package does not have to\r\nhave the limits in 'install_requires' section which makes\r\nit much more \"standalone.\r\n\r\nWe can add more requirements there as needed or remove\r\nthem when provider's dependencies change.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to using --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies flag in\r\nBreeze, the instructions on what to do when there is\r\na problem with conflicting dependencies are much simpler.\r\n\r\nThis is a final step of making airflow package fully\r\nindependent from the provider's dependencies.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Pinot has two APIs that are available under different endpoints. Newer versions of pinotdb only support the new API, but older versions support the older APIs. Everything looks great, but older versions of pinotdb do not follow the DBAPI specification exactly, so there is a chance that compatibility issues may arise.  There is a small chance that someone is still using these versions as this version is 3 years old and the newer versions of this library fixed many critical issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it will force the library to be updated to the newer version, because now the cached version is used.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Request Intention**\r\n\r\nWhen submitting a job to AWS Batch, AWS allows you to provide _tags_ to help track, slice and dice costs in AWS Cost Explorer (or similar finance tools). The [boto3 Batch submit_job API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/batch.html#Batch.Client.submit_job) allows tags to be passed but Airflow's AwsBatchOperator currently does not provide an argument for passing tags along to the boto3 API. \r\n\r\n**Disclaimer**\r\n\r\nThis is my first Airflow pull request and I'm imagining that will show through in some form or another. I was having difficulty getting **breeze** set up locally for confirming that my code change passes all of the quality checks--therefore I am opening the PR hoping that I can use the remote CI system for confirming/iterating on ensuring this change meets the quality standard (seems like a small enough change where my ill-advised iteration cycle may suffice but we shall see 🤞 )\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is no open issue for this feature but I am happy to create one for tracking purposes if that is standard practice (please let me know if so)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-31T03:05:17Z","updated_at":"2020-12-31T10:45:44Z","closed_at":"2020-12-31T10:45:42Z","merged_at":"2020-12-31T10:45:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd74eb0ca0bb5f81cd98e2c151257a404d4a55a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

#12468 \r\n\r\nAdded a new api rest endpoint in the stable api to query the installed providers. It provides the same information as the cli command \"airflow providers list\"\r\n\r\nNote:  There is some code duplication between provider_endpoint.py and  provider_command.py regarding_remove_rst_syntax and the mapping, i kept it like this becouse i assume that in future its possible that the rest api and the cli returns different informations/fields but if that's not the case and the rest and cli will always return the same information then i can refactor my pr to avoid this

PR disables persisting credentials in Github Actions checkout.\r\n\r\nThis is a result of discussion in

actios (specifically\r\ncheckout action) can use GITHUB_TOKEN without specifying it as\r\ninput in the yaml file and the GitHub checkout action\r\nleaves the repository with credentials stored locally that\r\nenable pushing to Github Repository by any step in the same\r\njob. This was thought to be forbidden initially (and the\r\ndocumentation clearly says that the action must have the\r\nGITHUB_TOKEN passed to it in .yaml workflow in order to\r\nuse it). But apparently it behaves differently.\r\n\r\nThis leaves open an attack vector where for example\r\nany PIP package installed in the following steps could push\r\nany changes to GitHub Repository of Apache Airflow.\r\n\r\nSecurity incidents have been reported to both GitHub and\r\nApache Security team, but in the meantime we add configuration\r\nto remove credentials after checkout step.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow\r\n\r\n> Using the GITHUB_TOKEN in a workflow\r\n\r\n> To use the GITHUB_TOKEN secret, you *must* reference it in your workflow\r\n  file. Using a token might include passing the token as an input to an\r\n  action that requires it, or making authenticated GitHub API calls.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

had some issues figuring out how to make custom connections work. Thankfully, @potiuk was very supportive in the airflow slack channel and helped me out. I'm happy to contribute to the docs in a way that I believe I would have found very helpful initially.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n- The `How to create your own provider` section should be on the main level, otherwise it is easy to overlook and also is confusing with the very similarly named `Creating your own providers` subsection of the `FAQ for Airflow and Providers` - especially since you may be linked to this page from the connection page, looking for information on, well, _creating your own providers_\r\n- I added a verbose section on what exactly to do to make a package a provider\r\n- I took the liberty to also make some minor language improvements wherever I stumbled across an opportunity to do so\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to use it as-is, make any additional changes, or ignore my suggestions altogether.\r\n\r\nBig thanks again to @potiuk for helping me out!

#13350\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with the `UndefinedJinjaVariablesRule` upgrade check wherein non-templated objects passed into tasks under fields that would be templated would break the upgrade check. The altered logic now correctly handles cases where regular objects are passed in directly without affecting the current tested behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `test_invalid_check` test was quarantined in #12657 - I've removed the quarantine here in hopes that it might be less flaky.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
