After map statuses are broadcasted and the executors obtain serialized broadcasted map statuses. If any fetch failure happens after, Spark scheduler invalidates cached map statuses and destroy broadcasted value of the map statuses. Then any executor trying to deserialize serialized broadcasted map statuses and access broadcasted value, `IOException` will be thrown. Currently we don't catch it in `MapOutputTrackerWorker` and above exception will fail the application.\r\n\r\nNormally we should throw a fetch failure exception for such case. Spark scheduler will handle this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32015 added a way to run benchmarks much more easily in the same GitHub Actions build. This PR updates the benchmark results by using the way.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** that looks like GitHub Actions use four types of CPU given my observations:\r\n\r\n- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8171M CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n- Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v4 @ 2.30GHz\r\n- Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v3 @ 2.40GHz\r\n- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8272CL CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n\r\nGiven my quick research, seems like they perform roughly similarly:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-04-03 at 9 31 23 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/113478478-f4b57b80-94c3-11eb-9047-f81ca8c59672.png)\r\n\r\nI couldn't find enough information about Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8272CL CPU @ 2.60GHz but the performance seems roughly similar given the numbers.\r\n\r\nSo shouldn't be a big deal especially given that this way is much easier, encourages contributors to run more and guarantee the same number of cores and same memory with the same softwares. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo have a base line of the benchmarks accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was generated from:\r\n\r\n- [Run benchmarks: * (JDK 11)](https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/actions/runs/713575465)\r\n- [Run benchmarks: * (JDK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR prevents reregistering BlockManager when a Executor is shutting down. It is achieved by checking  `executorShutdown` before calling `env.blockManager.reregister()`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is required since Spark reports executors as active, even they are removed.\r\nI was testing Dynamic Allocation on K8s with about 300 executors. While doing so, when the executors were torn down due to `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout`, I noticed all the executor pods being removed from K8s, however, under the \"Executors\" tab in SparkUI, I could see some executors listed as alive.  [spark.sparkContext.statusTracker.getExecutorInfos.length](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/65da9287bc5112564836a555cd2967fc6b05856f/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkStatusTracker.scala#L105) also returned a value greater than 1. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new test.\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\nFollowing are the logs of the executor(Id:303) which re-registers

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `ownerReference` to the executor ConfigMap to fix leakage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-30985 maintains the executor config map explicitly inside Spark. However, this config map can be leaked when Spark drivers die accidentally or are killed by K8s. We need to add `ownerReference` to make K8s do the garbage collection these automatically.\r\n\r\nThe number of ConfigMap is one of the resource quota. So, the leaked configMaps currently cause Spark jobs submission failures.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and check manually.\r\n\r\nK8s IT is tested manually.\r\n```\r\nKubernetesSuite:\r\n- Run SparkPi with no resources\r\n- Run SparkPi with a very long application name.\r\n- Use

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNote that this PR proposes an alternate solution to #32032.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce the `CommandWithAnalyzedChildren` trait such that a command that extends the trait will have its children only analyzed, but not optimized. This can be useful if a logical plan has children where they need to be only analyzed, but not optimized - e.g., `CREATE VIEW` or `CACHE TABLE AS`. This also addresses the issue found in #31933.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates `CreateViewCommand` and `CacheTableAsSelect` to use the new trait such that their children are only analyzed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo address the issue where the plan is unnecessarily re-analyzed in `CreateViewCommand`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded missing `@ExpressionDescription` annotation to `TimeWindow` to generate a missing section of documentation for the sql `window` function.\r\nSee: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#window for current missing documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current documentation simply displays `N/A` for documentation for the sql `window` function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This adds documentation to the sql `window` function, which is currently missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nno tests added/modified. Manually verified by building docs and inspecting manually.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-02T23:06:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-05T16:28:06Z","closed_at":"2021-04-05T16:28:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3bd90f221942c88333225fc85bf1d6c172ad8af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba37ad7edc405c7f18d26a7e7155684a4b992dbd","head":{"label":"mbaldini:mbaldini-timewindow-documentation","ref":"mbaldini-timewindow-documentation","sha":"ba37ad7edc405c7f18d26a7e7155684a4b992dbd","user":{"login":"mbaldini","id":2850002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTAwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2850002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaldini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":353519169,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTM1MTkxNjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"mbaldini/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbaldini","id":2850002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTAwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2850002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaldini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaldini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbaldini/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPopulate table catalog and identifier from `DataStreamWriter` to `WriteToMicroBatchDataSource` so that we can invalidate cache for tables that are updated by a streaming write. \r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related [SPARK-27484](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27484) and [SPARK-34183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34183) (#31700), as ideally we may want to replace `WriteToMicroBatchDataSource` and `WriteToDataSourceV2` with logical write nodes and feed them to analyzer. That will potentially change the code path involved in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `WriteToDataSourceV2` doesn't have cache invalidation logic, and therefore, when the target table for a micro batch streaming job is cached, the cache entry won't be removed when the table is updated. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes now when a DSv2 table which supports streaming write is updated by a streaming job, its cache will also be invalidated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new UT.","created_at":"2021-04-02T21:24:39Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T13:31:24Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T13:31:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8137ac2ac52e5350c260110925933a7f4c7ba9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse proper Java doc format for Java classes within `catalyst` module\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

Columns defined as \"varchar(N)\" may optionally be implemented as \"char(N)\".\r\nf) Date means that the column shall be able to express any calendar day between January 1, 1900 and\r\nDecember 31, 2199.\r\n2.2.2.2 The datatypes do not correspond to any specific SQL-standard datatype. The definitions are provided to\r\nhighlight the properties that are required for a particular column. The benchmark implementer may employ any internal representation or SQL datatype that meets those requirements.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes that we use int for identifiers instead of bigint to reach a compromise with TPC-DS Standard Specification.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the field schemas are now consistent with those DDLs in the `tpcds.sql` from tpc-ds tool kit, see https://gist.github.com/yaooqinn/b9978a77bbf4f871a95d6a9103019907\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs a first step of [SPARK-34849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34849), this PR proposes porting the Koalas main code into PySpark.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains minimal changes to the existing Koalas code as follows:\r\n1. `databricks.koalas` -> `pyspark.pandas`\r\n2. `from databricks import koalas as ks` -> `from pyspark import pandas as pp`\r\n3. `ks.xxx -> pp.xxx`\r\n\r\nOther than them:\r\n1. Added a line to `python/mypy.ini` in order to ignore the mypy test. See related issue at [SPARK-34941](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34941).\r\n2. Added a comment to several lines in several files to ignore the flake8 F401. See related issue at [SPARK-34943](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34943).\r\n\r\nWhen this PR is merged, all the features that were previously used in [Koalas](https://github.com/databricks/koalas) will be available in PySpark as well.\r\n\r\nUsers can access to the pandas API in PySpark as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark import pandas as pp\r\n>>> ppdf = pp.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 3], \"B\": [15, 20, 25]})\r\n>>> ppdf\r\n   A   B\r\n0  1  15\r\n1  2  20\r\n2  3  25\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe existing \"options and settings\" in Koalas are also available in the same way:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option, reset_option, get_option\r\n>>> ppser1 = pp.Series([1, 2, 3])\r\n>>> ppser2 = pp.Series([3, 4, 5])\r\n>>> ppser1 + ppser2\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: Cannot combine the series or dataframe because it comes from a different dataframe. In order to allow this operation, enable 'compute.ops_on_diff_frames' option.\r\n\r\n>>> set_option(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True)\r\n>>> ppser1 + ppser2\r\n0    4\r\n1    6\r\n2    8\r\ndtype: int64\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease also refer to the [API Reference](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html) and [Options and Settings](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/options.html) for more detail.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** that this PR intentionally ports the main codes of Koalas first almost as are with minimal changes because:\r\n- Koalas project is fairly large. Making some changes together for PySpark will make it difficult to review the individual change.\r\n    Koalas dev includes multiple Spark committers who will review. By doing this, the committers will be able to more easily and effectively review and drive the development.\r\n- Koalas tests and documentation require major changes to make it look great together with PySpark whereas main codes do not require.\r\n- We lately froze the Koalas codebase, and plan to work together on the initial porting. By porting the main codes first as are, it unblocks the Koalas dev to work on other items in parallel.\r\n\r\nI promise and will make sure on:\r\n- Rename Koalas to PySpark pandas APIs and/or pandas-on-Spark accordingly in documentation, and the docstrings and comments in the main codes.\r\n- Triage APIs to remove that don’t make sense when Koalas is in PySpark\r\n\r\nThe documentation changes will be tracked in [SPARK-34885](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34885), the test code changes will be tracked in [SPARK-34886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34886).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPlease refer to:\r\n- [[DISCUSS] Support pandas API layer on PySpark](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Support-pandas-API-layer-on-PySpark-td30945.html)\r\n- [[VOTE] SPIP: Support pandas API layer on

After map statuses are broadcasted and the executors obtain serialized broadcasted map statuses. If any fetch failure happens after, Spark scheduler invalidates cached map statuses and destroy broadcasted value of the map statuses. Then any executor trying to deserialize serialized broadcasted map statuses and access broadcasted value, `IOException` will be thrown. Currently we don't catch it in `MapOutputTrackerWorker` and above exception will fail the application.\r\n\r\nNormally we should throw a fetch failure exception for such case. Spark scheduler will handle this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce the `AnalysisOnlyCommand` trait such that a command that extends this trait can have its children only analyzed, but not optimized. There is a corresponding analysis rule `HandleAnalysisOnlyCommand` that marks the command as analyzed after all other analysis rules are run.\r\n\r\nThis can be useful if a logical plan has children where they need to be only analyzed, but not optimized - e.g., `CREATE VIEW` or `CACHE TABLE AS`. This also addresses the issue found in #31933.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates `CreateViewCommand`, `CacheTableAsSelect`, and `AlterViewAsCommand` to use the new trait / rule such that their children are only analyzed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo address the issue where the plan is unnecessarily re-analyzed in `CreateViewCommand`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests should cover the changes.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-02T00:38:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T23:08:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-14T08:24:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79ccc89f3aaa2a84f30f0c32a734edba8e1032ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/111ef8be8bc03a62389aed4f0871b958714eb789","head":{"label":"imback82:skip_transform","ref":"skip_transform","sha":"111ef8be8bc03a62389aed4f0871b958714eb789","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR contains Remote Shuffle Service on Kubernetes. The code is mostly copied from [Uber Remote Shuffle Service](https://github.com/uber/RemoteShuffleService) and modified with some renaming. Also added Kubernetes related support which does not exist in original Uber Remote Shuffle Service.\r\n\r\nSee [here](https://github.com/hiboyang/spark/tree/remote-shuffle-service/remote-shuffle-service) for how to build and run remote shuffle service in Kubernetes. This is initial work and comments/suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is still difficult to use dynamic allocation with Spark on Kubernetes. There are several disaggregated/remote shuffle solutions in different companies. Hopefully we could get a remote shuffle implementation into Spark and enhanced in the future by the Spark community.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, user could set Spark config (spark.shuffle.manager=org.apache.spark.shuffle.RssShuffleManager) to run Spark applications with remote shuffle service. It will make Spark use the new RssShuffleManager to write/read shuffle data to/from remote shuffle service.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with Spark application in

These methods have an overly-generic implementation to iterate over the children and rely on reflection to create new instances. We have observed that, especially for queries with large query plans, a significant amount of CPU cycles are wasted in these methods. In this PR we make these methods more efficient, by delegating the iteration and instantiation to concrete node types. The benchmarks show that we can expect significant performance improvement in total query compilation time in queries with large query plans (from 30-80%) and about 20% on average. \r\n\r\n#### Problem detail\r\nThe `mapChildren` method in `TreeNode` is overly generic and costly. To be more specific, this method:\r\n- iterates over all the fields of a node using Scala’s product iterator. While the iteration is not reflection-based, thanks to the Scala compiler generating code for `Product`, we create many anonymous functions and visit many nested structures (recursive calls).\r\nThe anonymous functions (presumably compiled to Java anonymous inner classes) also show up quite high on the list in the object allocation profiles, so we are putting unnecessary pressure on GC here.\r\n- does a lot of comparisons. Basically for each element returned from the product iterator, we check if it is a child (contained in the list of children) and then transform it. We can avoid that by just iterating over children, but in the current implementation, we need to gather all the fields (only transform the children) so that we can instantiate the object using the reflection.\r\n- creates objects using reflection, by delegating to the `makeCopy` method, which is several orders of magnitude slower than using the constructor.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nThe proposed solution in this PR is rather straightforward: we rewrite the `mapChildren` method using the `children` and `withNewChildren` methods. The default `withNewChildren` method suffers from the same problems as `mapChildren` and we need to make it more efficient by specializing it in concrete classes.  Similar to how each concrete query plan node already defines its children, it should also define how they can be constructed given a new list of children. Actually, the implementation is quite simple in most cases and is a one-liner thanks to the copy method present in Scala case classes. Note that we cannot abstract over the copy method, it’s generated by the compiler for case classes if no other type higher in the hierarchy defines it. For most concrete nodes, the implementation of `withNewChildren` looks like this:\r\n```\r\noverride def withNewChildren(newChildren: Seq[LogicalPlan]): LogicalPlan = copy(children = newChildren)\r\n```\r\nThe current `withNewChildren` method has two properties that we should preserve:\r\n\r\n- It returns the same instance if the provided children are the same as its children, i.e., it preserves referential equality.\r\n- It copies tags and maintains the origin links when a new copy is created.\r\n\r\nThese properties are hard to enforce in the concrete node type implementation. Therefore, we propose a template method `withNewChildrenInternal` that should be rewritten by the concrete classes and let the `withNewChildren` method take care of referential equality and copying:\r\n```\r\noverride def withNewChildren(newChildren: Seq[LogicalPlan]): LogicalPlan = {\r\n if (childrenFastEquals(children, newChildren)) {\r\n   this\r\n } else {\r\n   CurrentOrigin.withOrigin(origin) {\r\n     val res = withNewChildrenInternal(newChildren)\r\n     res.copyTagsFrom(this)\r\n     res\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the refactoring done in a previous PR (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31932) most tree node types fall in one of the categories of `Leaf`, `Unary`, `Binary` or `Ternary`. These traits have a more efficient implementation for `mapChildren` and define a more specialized version of `withNewChildrenInternal` that avoids creating unnecessary lists. For example, the `mapChildren` method in `UnaryLike` is defined as follows:\r\n```\r\n  override final def mapChildren(f: T => T): T = {\r\n    val newChild = f(child)\r\n    if (newChild fastEquals child) {\r\n      this.asInstanceOf[T]\r\n    } else {\r\n      CurrentOrigin.withOrigin(origin) {\r\n        val res = withNewChildInternal(newChild)\r\n        res.copyTagsFrom(this.asInstanceOf[T])\r\n        res\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Results\r\nWith this PR, we have observed significant performance improvements in query compilation time, more specifically in the analysis and optimization phases. The table below shows the TPC-DS queries that had more than 25% speedup in compilation times. Biggest speedups are observed in queries with large query plans.\r\n| Query  | Speedup |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|q4    |29%|\r\n|q9    |81%|\r\n|q14a  |31%|\r\n|q14b  |28%|\r\n|q22   |33%|\r\n|q33   |29%|\r\n|q34   |25%|\r\n|q39   |27%|\r\n|q41   |27%|\r\n|q44   |26%|\r\n|q47   |28%|\r\n|q48   |76%|\r\n|q49   |46%|\r\n|q56   |26%|\r\n|q58   |43%|\r\n|q59   |46%|\r\n|q60   |50%|\r\n|q65   |59%|\r\n|q66   |46%|\r\n|q67   |52%|\r\n|q69   |31%|\r\n|q70   |30%|\r\n|q96   |26%|\r\n|q98   |32%|\r\n\r\n#### Binary incompatibility\r\nChanging the `withNewChildren` in `TreeNode` breaks the binary compatibility of the code compiled against older versions of Spark because now it is expected that concrete `TreeNode` subclasses all implement the `withNewChildrenInternal` method. This is a problem, for example, when users write custom expressions. This change is the right choice, since it forces all newly added expressions to Catalyst implement it in an efficient manner and will prevent future regressions. \r\nPlease note that we have not completely removed the old implementation and renamed it to `legacyWithNewChildren`. This method will be removed in the future and for now helps the transition. There are expressions such as `UpdateFields` that have a complex way of defining children. Writing `withNewChildren` for them requires refactoring the expression. For now, these expressions use the old, slow method. In a future PR we address these expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR does not introduce user facing changes but my break binary compatibility of the code compiled against older versions.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new analysis rule `DeduplicateRelations`, which deduplicates any duplicate relations in a plan first and then deduplicates conflicting attributes(which resued the `dedupRight` of `ResolveReferences`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`CostBasedJoinReorder` could fail when applying on self-join, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// test in JoinReorderSuite\r\ntest(\"join reorder with self-join\") {\r\n  val plan = t2.join(t1, Inner, Some(nameToAttr(\"t1.k-1-2\") === nameToAttr(\"t2.k-1-5\")))\r\n      .select(nameToAttr(\"t1.v-1-10\"))\r\n      .join(t2, Inner, Some(nameToAttr(\"t1.v-1-10\") === nameToAttr(\"t2.k-1-5\")))\r\n\r\n    // this can fail\r\n    Optimize.execute(plan.analyze)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBesides, with the new rule `DeduplicateRelations`, we'd be able to enable some optimizations, e.g., LeftSemiAnti pushdown, redundant project removal, as reflects in updated unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded and updated unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes the description that `||` and `&&` can be used as logical operators from the migration guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAt the `Compatibility with Apache Hive` section in the migration guide, it describes that `||` and `&&` can be used as logical operators.\r\nBut, in fact, they cannot be used as described.\r\nAFAIK, Hive also doesn't support `&&` and `||` as logical operators.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed that `&&` and `||` cannot be used as logical operators with both Hive's interactive shell and `spark-sql`.\r\nI also built the modified document and confirmed that the modified document doesn't break layout.","created_at":"2021-04-01T08:33:49Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T22:15:35Z","closed_at":"2021-04-01T22:14:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5cc4f66066b747c64e8085fb4747ab3c35bb0eb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5ca0e17d0eb482609e3cef686a08a5602331f93","head":{"label":"sarutak:modify-hive-compatibility-doc","ref":"modify-hive-compatibility-doc","sha":"a5ca0e17d0eb482609e3cef686a08a5602331f93","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nGROUP BY ... GROUPING SETS (...) is a weird SQL syntax we copied from Hive. It's not in the SQL standard or any other mainstream databases. This syntax requires users to repeat the expressions inside `GROUPING SETS (...)` after `GROUP BY`, and has a weird null semantic if `GROUP BY` contains extra expressions than `GROUPING SETS (...)`.\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecates this syntax:\r\n1. Do not promote it in the document and only mention it as a Hive compatible sytax.\r\n2. Simplify the code to only keep it for Hive compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDeprecate a weird grammar.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo breaking change, but it removes a check to simplify the code: `GROUP BY a GROUPING SETS(a, b)` fails before and forces users to also put `b` after `GROUP BY`. Now this works just as `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(a, b)`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges the metadata propagation framework.\r\n\r\nPreviously, most `LogicalPlan`'s propagated their `children`'s `metadataOutput`. This did not make sense in cases where the `LogicalPlan` did not even propagate their `children`'s `output`.\r\n\r\nI set the metadata output for plans that do not propagate their `children`'s `output` to be `Nil`. Notably, `Project` and `View` no longer have metadata output.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, `SELECT m from (SELECT a from tb)` would output `m` if it were metadata. This did not make sense.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Now, `SELECT m from (SELECT a from tb)` will encounter an `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests. I did not cover all cases, as they are fairly extensive. However, the new tests cover major cases (and an existing test already covers

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a workflow that allows developers to run benchmarks and download the results files.  After this PR, developers can run benchmarks in GitHub Actions in their fork.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Very easy to use.\r\n2. We can use the (almost) same environment to run the benchmarks. Given my few experiments and observation, the CPU, cores, and memory are same.\r\n3. Does not burden ASF's resource at GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/31.\r\n\r\nEntire benchmarks are being run as below:\r\n- [Run benchmarks: * (JDK 11)](https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/actions/runs/713575465)\r\n- [Run benchmarks: * (JDK 8)](https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/actions/runs/713154337)\r\n\r\n### How do developers use it in their fork?\r\n\r\n1. **Go to Actions in your fork, and click \"Run benchmarks\"**\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2021-03-31 at 10 15 13 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/113150018-99d71680-926e-11eb-8647-4ecf062c55f2.png)\r\n\r\n2. **Run the benchmarks with JDK 8 or 11 with benchmark classes to run. Glob pattern is supported just like `testOnly` in SBT**\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2021-04-02 at 8 35 02

underlying workflow:**\r\n\r\n    ![Screen Shot 2021-03-31 at 10 17 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/113150332-ede1fb00-926e-11eb-9c0e-97d195070508.png)\r\n\r\n4. **After downloading it, unzip and untar at Spark git root directory:**\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    cd .../spark\r\n    mv ~/Downloads/benchmark-results-8.zip .\r\n    unzip benchmark-results-8.zip\r\n    tar -xvf benchmark-results-8.tar\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n5. **Check the results:**\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git status\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n        modified:

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn #30965 we changed to CBO cost comparison function so it would be \"symetric\": `A.betterThan(B)` now implies, that `!B.betterThan(A)`.\r\nWith that we caused a performance regressions in some queries - TPCDS q19 for example.\r\n\r\nThe original cost comparison function used the ratios `relativeRows = A.rowCount / B.rowCount` and `relativeSize = A.size / B.size`. The changed function compared \"absolute\" cost values `costA = w*A.rowCount + (1-w)*A.size` and `costB = w*B.rowCount + (1-w)*B.size`.\r\n\r\nGiven the input from @wzhfy we decided to go back to the relative values, because otherwise one (size) may overwhelm the other (rowCount). But this time we avoid adding up the ratios.\r\n\r\nOriginally `A.betterThan(B) => w*relativeRows + (1-w)*relativeSize < 1` was used. Besides being \"non-symteric\", this also can exhibit one overwhelming other. \r\nFor `w=0.5` If `A` size (bytes) is at least 2x larger than `B`, then no matter how many times more rows does the `B` plan have, `B` will allways be considered to be better - `0.5*2 + 0.5*0.00000000000001 > 1`.\r\n\r\nWhen working with ratios, then it would be better to multiply them.\r\nThe proposed cost comparison function is: `A.betterThan(B) => relativeRows^w  * relativeSize^(1-w) < 1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nComparison of the changed TPCDS v1.4 query execution times at sf=10:\r\n\r\n  | absolute | multiplicative |   | additive |  \r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nq12 | 145 | 137 | -5.52% | 141 | -2.76%\r\nq13 | 264 | 271 | 2.65% | 271 | 2.65%\r\nq17 | 4521 | 4243 | -6.15% | 4348 | -3.83%\r\nq18 | 758 | 466 | -38.52% | 480 | -36.68%\r\nq19 | 38503 | 2167 | -94.37% | 2176 | -94.35%\r\nq20 | 119 | 120 | 0.84% | 126 | 5.88%\r\nq24a | 16429 | 16838 | 2.49% | 17103 | 4.10%\r\nq24b | 16592 | 16999 | 2.45% | 17268 | 4.07%\r\nq25 | 3558 | 3556 | -0.06% | 3675 | 3.29%\r\nq33 | 362 | 361 | -0.28% | 380 | 4.97%\r\nq52 | 1020 | 1032 | 1.18% | 1052 | 3.14%\r\nq55 | 927 | 938 | 1.19% | 961 | 3.67%\r\nq72 | 24169 | 13377 | -44.65% | 24306 | 0.57%\r\nq81 | 1285 | 1185 | -7.78% | 1168 | -9.11%\r\nq91 | 324 | 336 | 3.70% | 337 | 4.01%\r\nq98 | 126 | 129 | 2.38% | 131 | 3.97%\r\n\r\nAll times are in ms, the change is compared to the situation in the master branch (absolute). \r\nThe proposed cost function (multiplicative) significantlly improves the performance on q18, q19 and q72. The original cost function (additive) has similar improvements at q18 and q19. All other chagnes are within the error bars and I would ignore them - perhaps q81 has also improved.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSQLSTATE is defined by the ANSI/ISO SQL-99 standard as a 5-character string value. The characters of an SQLSTATE code are divided logically into two categories:\r\n- A 2-character class value.\r\nThe first two characters of the SQLSTATE code are any one of the ANSI/ISO SQL-99-defined SQLSTATE classes ([see SQLSTATE Class Definitions](https://docs.teradata.com/r/EClCkxtGMW6hxXXtL8sBfA/SdcEvzV7jTN1Z4K5QGgUWg?section=xtg1472241406415__BHBJGDBE_xreftarget)).\r\n\r\n- A 3-character subclass value.\r\nSubclass values can be any numeric or simple uppercase LATIN character string.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see [ANSI.pdf](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/6236838/ANSI.pdf) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pr adds SQLSTATE and ERRORCODE to SQL exception to follow SQL standard by following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new abstract class `ErrorCode`. Each module has its own implementation. For example: [core module](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89c6f523c832daf7cff5c1ba8aecfbcd5494d5af/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/errors/coreErrors.scala#L19-L20) and [catalyst module](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89c6f523c832daf7cff5c1ba8aecfbcd5494d5af/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/errors/catalystErrors.scala#L22-L29).\r\n2. Add `ErrorCode` to each Spark Exception. For example [SparkUpgradeException](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89c6f523c832daf7cff5c1ba8aecfbcd5494d5af/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkException.scala#L62-L64) , [SparkRuntimeException](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89c6f523c832daf7cff5c1ba8aecfbcd5494d5af/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkException.scala#L67-L74) and [AnalysisException](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89c6f523c832daf7cff5c1ba8aecfbcd5494d5af/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/AnalysisException.scala#L30-L60)\r\n3. Convert Spark Exception to `HiveSQLException` with `ErrorCode`. For example: [SQLExceptionUtils.toHiveSQLException](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89c6f523c832daf7cff5c1ba8aecfbcd5494d5af/sql/hive-thriftserver/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/thriftserver/SQLExceptionUtils.scala#L33-L40).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/113589012-6ed03680-9663-11eb-94ab-e0add6560abc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome references:\r\nhttps://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/blob/8.0.23/src/main/core-api/java/com/mysql/cj/exceptions/MysqlErrorNumbers.java\r\nhttps://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-jdbc/blob/v3.13.2/src/main/java/net/snowflake/client/jdbc/ErrorCode.java\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Follow SQL standard.\r\n2. Some JDBC/ODBC user need SQLSTATE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n//

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31954/, Array type is allowed to be cast as String type. So the customized conversion failure message branch from AnsiCast.typeCheckFailureMessage won't be reached anymore.\r\nThis PR is to remove the dead code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCode clean up.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse row indexes to read column values properly in Parquet vectorized reader. It works like follow\r\n1. Save rowIndexes to VectorizedColumnReader\r\n2. In the loop of a readBatch, write batch number of values into a temp vector \r\n3. Check the indexes of values in the temp vector with rowIndexes, write matched values to the result vector\r\n4. If the result vector is not full, go back to step 2\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using column index, pages among different columns may not be aligned.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome `spark-submit`  commands used to run benchmarks in the user's guide is wrong, we can't use these commands to run benchmarks successful.\r\n\r\nSo the major changes of this pr is correct these wrong commands, for example, run a benchmark which inherits from `SqlBasedBenchmark`, we must specify `--jars <spark core test jar>,<spark catalyst test jar>` because `SqlBasedBenchmark` based benchmark extends `BenchmarkBase(defined in spark core test jar)` and `SQLHelper(defined in spark catalyst test jar)`.\r\n\r\nAnother change of this pr is removed the `scalatest Assertions` dependency of Benchmarks because `scalatest-*.jar` are not in the distribution package, it will be troublesome to use.\r\n\r\n### Why are the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd check if `CoalesceShufflePartitions` really coalesce shuffle partition number.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `CoalesceShufflePartitions` can not coalesce such case if the total shuffle partitions size of mappers are big enough. Then it's confused to use `CustomShuffleReaderExec` which marked as `coalesced` but has no affect with partition number.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nProbably yes, the plan changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current EventLoggingListener, we won't write SparkListenerExecutorMetricsUpdate message to event log file at all\r\n\r\n```\r\noverride def

liveStageExecutorMetrics.foreach { case (stageKey2, metricsPerExecutor) =>\r\n        // If the update came from the driver, stageKey1 will be the dummy key (-1, -1),\r\n        // so record those

Executor's executor metrics can be updated with TaskEnd event etc...\r\n\r\nSo in this pr, I add support to log SparkListenerExecutorMetricsUpdateEvent of `driver` when `spark.eventLog.logStageExecutorMetrics` is true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake user can got driver's peakMemoryMetrics in SHS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n user can got driver's executor metrics in SHS's restful API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMannul test\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-29T09:09:28Z","updated_at":"2021-06-17T17:09:54Z","closed_at":"2021-06-17T17:08:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7720e58038d8ccaabce631e1878e2819290ab4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87a079e5fa159dad343adcf8ac3f158ff4870f6b","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-34898","ref":"SPARK-34898","sha":"87a079e5fa159dad343adcf8ac3f158ff4870f6b","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a connection for TransportClient is marked as idled and closed, we suggest users adjust `spark.network.timeout` for all transport modules. As a lot of timeout configs will fallback to the `spark.network.timeout`, this could be a piece of overkill advice, we should give a more targeted one with `spark.${moduleName}.io.connectionTimeout`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbetter advise for overloaded network traffic cases\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, when a connection is zombied and closed by spark internally, users can use a more targeted config to tune their jobs\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nJust log and doc.

this PR is a part of SPARK-10816 (`EventTime based sessionization (session window)`). Please refer #31937 to see the overall view of the code change. (Note that code diff could be diverged a bit.)\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces state store manager for session window in streaming query. Session window in batch query wouldn't need to leverage state store manager.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures versioning on state format for state store manager, so that we can apply further optimization after releasing Spark version. StreamingSessionWindowStateManager is a trait defining the available methods in session window state store manager. Its subclasses are classes implementing the trait with versioning.\r\n\r\nThe format of version 1 leverages the new feature of \"prefix match scan\" to represent the session windows:\r\n\r\n* full key : [ group keys, start time in session window ]\r\n* prefix key [ group keys ]\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis part is a one of required on implementing SPARK-10816.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suite

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`SparkContext.getCallSite` uses local lazy variable. In Scala 2.11, local lazy val requires synchronization so for large number of job submissions in the same context, it will be a bottleneck. This only for branch-2.4 as we drop Scala 2.11 support at SPARK-26132.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo avoid possible bottleneck for large number of job submissions in the same context.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

this PR is a part of SPARK-10816 (`EventTime based sessionization (session window)`). Please refer #31937 to see the overall view of the code change. (Note that code diff could be diverged a bit.)\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces MergingSessionsIterator, which enables to merge elements belong to the same session directly.\r\n\r\nMergingSessionsIterator is a variant of SortAggregateIterator which merges the session windows based on the fact input rows are sorted by \"group keys + the start time of session window\". When merging windows, MergingSessionsIterator also applies aggregations on merged window, which eliminates the necessity on buffering inputs (which requires copying rows) and update the session spec for each input.\r\n\r\nMergingSessionsIterator is quite performant compared to UpdatingSessionsIterator brought by SPARK-34888. Note that MergingSessionsIterator can only apply to the cases aggregation can be applied altogether, so there're still rooms for UpdatingSessionIterator to be used.\r\n\r\nThis issue also introduces MergingSessionsExec which is the physical node on leveraging MergingSessionsIterator to sort the input rows and aggregate rows according to the session windows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis part is a one of required on implementing SPARK-10816.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test

this PR is a part of SPARK-10816 (`EventTime based sessionization (session window)`). Please refer #31937 to see the overall view of the code change. (Note that code diff could be diverged a bit.)\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces UpdatingSessionsIterator, which analyzes neighbor elements and adjust session information on elements.\r\n\r\nUpdatingSessionsIterator calculates and updates the session window for each element in the given iterator, which makes elements in the same session window having same session spec. Downstream can apply aggregation to finally merge these elements bound to the same session window.\r\n\r\nUpdatingSessionsIterator works on the precondition that given iterator is sorted by \"group keys + start time of session window\", and the iterator still retains the characteristic of the sort.\r\n\r\nUpdatingSessionsIterator copies the elements to safely update on each element, as well as buffers elements which are bound to the same session window. Due to such overheads, MergingSessionsIterator which will be introduced via SPARK-34889 should be used whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces UpdatingSessionsExec which is the physical node on leveraging UpdatingSessionsIterator to sort the input rows and updates session information on input rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis part is a one of required on implementing SPARK-10816.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suite added.","created_at":"2021-03-29T04:12:30Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T08:17:46Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T12:06:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e64bcb467cc7bceaa11e9bae17d7ddef8b57b894","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is an useful for the following scenarios:\r\n1. When ANSI mode is on, users can choose `try_cast` an alternative way to run SQL without errors for certain operations.\r\n2. When ANSI mode is off, users can use `try_cast` to get a more reasonable result for casting a value to an integral type: when an overflow error happens, `try_cast` returns null while `cast` returns the low order bytes of the source value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adding a new function `try_cast`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExtend the `TransposeWindow` rule to transpose `Window` nodes, that have `Project` between them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe analyzer will turn a `dataset.withColumn(\"colName\", expressionWithWindowFunction)` method call to a `Project - Window - Project` chain in the logical plan. When this method is called multiple times in a row, then the projects can block the `Window` nodes from being transposed by the current `TransposeWindow` rule.\r\n\r\nTPCDS q47 and q57 are also improved by this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2021-03-27T13:26:39Z","updated_at":"2021-06-24T02:42:09Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T02:29:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da791a21d36dbd1eb78b687665dc1037f5320b41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60c6643f0bfda390baa32273f7ca1371a44d5771","head":{"label":"tanelk:SPARK-34807_transpose_window","ref":"SPARK-34807_transpose_window","sha":"60c6643f0bfda390baa32273f7ca1371a44d5771","user":{"login":"tanelk","id":3342974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDI5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3342974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk","html_url":"https://github.com/tanelk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":279394019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzkzOTQwMTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"tanelk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tanelk","id":3342974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDI5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3342974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk","html_url":"https://github.com/tanelk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tanelk/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nResolves the de-duplicated common columns from a NATURAL/USING JOINs.\r\n\r\nAllows users to resolve either side of the NATURAL/USING JOIN's common keys.\r\nPreviously, the user could only resolve the following columns:\r\n\r\n| Join type | Left key columns | Right key columns |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Inner | Yes | No |\r\n| Left | Yes | No |\r\n| Right | No | Yes |\r\n| Outer | No | No |\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The user can now symmetrically resolve the common columns from a NATURAL/USING JOIN.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSQL-side tests. The behavior matches PostgreSQL and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOn Running Spark job with yarn and deployment mode as client, Spark Driver and Spark Application master launch in two separate containers. In various scenarios there is need to see Spark Application master logs to see the resource allocation, Decommissioning status and other information shared between yarn RM and Spark Application master.\r\n\r\nIn Cluster mode Spark driver and Spark AM is on same container, So Log link of the driver already there to see the logs in Spark UI\r\n\r\nThis PR is for adding the spark AM log link for spark job running in the client mode for yarn. Instead of searching the container id and then find the logs. We can directly check in the Spark UI\r\n\r\nThis change is only for showing the AM log links in the Client mode when resource manager is yarn. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTill now the only way to check this by finding the container id of the AM and check the logs either using Yarn utility or Yarn RM Application History server. \r\n\r\nThis PR is for adding the spark AM log link for spark job running in the client mode for yarn.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add new expression `DivideDTInterval` which multiplies a `DayTimeIntervalType` expression by a `NumericType` expression including ByteType, ShortType, IntegerType, LongType, FloatType, DoubleType, DecimalType.\r\n2. Extend binary arithmetic rules to support `day-time interval / numeric`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires such operation over day-time

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the current code, a `QueryExecution` will be wrapped in `SQLExecution.withNewExecutionId` twice when run SQL with side effects.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\nRun SQLs below in spark-sql\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT 1 AS i;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM t;\r\nspark-sql> DROP TABLE t;\r\n```\r\nwe will see duplicate SQL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently MapType doesn't support orderable semantics, while it's supported in Hive/Presto. This makes it hard to migrate from Hive to SparkSQL if user have groupby/orderby map type in their sql.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nGenerally,  we compare two maps by the following steps:\r\n1. If the size of two maps are not equal, compare them by size.\r\n2. Otherwise, sort each map entry by map key, then compare two map entries one by one, first compare by key, then value.\r\n\r\nWe have to specially handle this in grouping/join/window because Spark SQL turns grouping/join/window partition keys into binary `UnsafeRow` and compare the binary data directly instead of using MapType's ordering. In this case, we have to insert a `SortMapKey` expression to sort map entry by key.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes an improvement on nested column pruning if the pruning target is generator's output. Previously we disallow such case. This patch allows to prune on it if there is only one single nested column is accessed after `Generate`.\r\n\r\nE.g., `df.select(explode($\"items\").as('item)).select($\"item.itemId\")`. As we only need `itemId` from `item`, we can prune other fields out and only keep `itemId`.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we only address explode-like generators. We will address other generators in followups.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis helps to extend the availability of nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe changes being proposed are to increase the accuracy of JDBCRelation's stride calculation, as outlined in: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34843\r\n\r\nIn summary: \r\n\r\nCurrently, in JDBCRelation (line 123), the stride size is calculated as follows:\r\nval stride: Long = upperBound / numPartitions - lowerBound / numPartitions\r\n\r\nDue to truncation happening on both divisions, the stride size can fall short of what it should be. This can lead to a big difference between the provided upper bound and the actual start of the last partition.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a different formula that doesn't truncate to early, and also maintains accuracy using fixed-point decimals. This helps tremendously with the size of the last partition, which can be even more amplified if there is data skew in that direction. In a real-life test, I've seen a 27% increase in performance with this more proper stride alignment. The reason for fixed-point decimals instead of floating-point decimals is because inaccuracy due to limitation of what the float can represent. This may seem small, but could shift the midpoint a bit, and depending on how granular the data is, that could translate to quite a difference. It's also just inaccurate, and I'm striving to make the partitioning as accurate as possible, within reason.\r\n\r\nLastly, since the last partition's predicate is determined by how the strides align starting from the lower bound (plus one stride), there can be skew introduced creating a larger last partition compared to the first partition. Therefore, after calculating a more precise stride size, I've also introduced logic to move the first partition's predicate (which is an offset from the lower bound) to a position that closely matches the offset of the last partition's predicate (in relation to the upper bound). This makes the first and last partition more evenly distributed compared to each other, and helps with the last task being the largest (reducing its size). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current implementation is inaccurate and can lead to the last task/partition running much longer than previous tasks. Therefore, you can end up with a single node/core running for an extended period while other nodes/cores are sitting idle. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. I would suspect some users will just get a good performance increase. As stated above, if we were to run our code on Spark that has this change implemented, we would have all of the sudden got a 27% increase in performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've added two new unit tests. I did need to update one unit test, but when you look at the comparison of the before and after, you'll see better alignment of the partitioning with the new implementation. Given that the lower partition's predicate is exclusive and the upper's is inclusive, the offset of the lower was 3 days, and the offset of the upper was 6 days... that's potentially twice the amount of data in that upper partition (could be much more depending on how the user's data is distributed).\r\n\r\nOther unit tests that utilize timestamps and two partitions have maintained their midpoint.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nI've added results with and without the realignment logic to better highlight both improvements this PR brings.\r\n\r\n**Example 1:**\r\nGiven the following partition config:\r\n\"lowerBound\" -> \"1930-01-01\"\r\n\"upperBound\" -> \"2020-12-31\"\r\n\"numPartitions\" -> 1000\r\n\r\n_Old method (exactly what it would be BEFORE this PR):_\r\nFirst

partition:_\r\nFirst partition: \"PartitionColumn\" < '1931-10-14' or \"PartitionColumn\" is null\r\nLast partition: \"PartitionColumn\" >= '2019-03-22'\r\n\r\n_New method:_\r\nFirst partition:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add new expression `DivideYMInterval` which multiplies a `YearMonthIntervalType` expression by a `NumericType` expression including ByteType, ShortType, IntegerType, LongType, FloatType, DoubleType, DecimalType.\r\n2. Extend binary arithmetic rules to support `year-month interval / numeric`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires such operation over year-month

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nA companion PR for SPARK-34817, when we handle the unsigned int(<=32) logical types. In this PR, we map the unsigned int64 to decimal(20, 0) for better compatibility. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark won't have unsigned types, but spark should be able to read existing parquet files written by other systems that support unsigned types for better compatibility. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, we can read parquet uint64 now\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31940 . This PR generalizes the matching of attributes and outer references, so that outer references are handled everywhere.\r\n\r\nNote that, currently correlated subquery has a lot of limitations in Spark, and the newly covered cases are not possible to happen. So this PR is a code refactor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

Currently ORC vectorized reader [does not support nested column type (struct, array and map)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/orc/OrcFileFormat.scala#L138). We implemented nested column vectorized reader for FB-ORC in our internal fork of Spark. We are seeing performance improvement compared to non-vectorized reader when reading nested columns. In addition, this can also help improve the non-nested column performance when reading non-nested and nested columns together in one query.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n\r\n* `OrcColumnVector` is the implementation class for Spark's `ColumnVector` to wrap Hive's/ORC's `ColumnVector` to read `AtomicType` data.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n\r\n* `OrcColumnVector` is an abstract class to keep interface being shared between multiple implementation class of orc column vectors, namely `OrcAtomicColumnVector` (for `AtomicType`), `OrcArrayColumnVector` (for `ArrayType`), `OrcMapColumnVector` (for `MapType`), `OrcStructColumnVector` (for `StructType`). So the original logic to read `AtomicType` data is moved from `OrcColumnVector` to `OrcAtomicColumnVector`. The abstract class of `OrcColumnVector` is needed here because of supporting nested column (i.e. nested column vectors).\r\n* A utility method `OrcColumnVectorUtils.toOrcColumnVector` is added to create Spark's `OrcColumnVector` from Hive's/ORC's `ColumnVector`.\r\n* A new user-facing config `spark.sql.orc.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` is added to control enabling/disabling vectorized reader for nested columns. The default value is false (i.e. disabling by default). For certain tables having deep nested columns, vectorized reader might take too much memory for each sub-column vectors, compared to non-vectorized reader. So providing a config here to work around OOM for query reading wide and deep nested columns if any. We plan to enable it by default on 3.3. Leave it disable in 3.2 in case for any unknown bugs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove query performance when reading nested columns from ORC file format.\r\nTested with locally adding a small benchmark in `OrcReadBenchmark.scala`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis bug was introduced by SPARK-30428 at Apache Spark 3.0.0.\r\nThis PR fixes `FileScan.equals()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Without this fix `FileScan.equals` doesn't take `fileIndex` and `readSchema` into account.\r\n- Partition filters and data filters added to `FileScan` (in #27112 and #27157) caused that canonicalized form of some `BatchScanExec` nodes don't match and this prevents some reuse possibilities.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, before this fix incorrect reuse of `FileScan` and so `BatchScanExec` could have happed causing correctness issues.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-24T09:18:39Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T19:24:16Z","closed_at":"2021-03-24T15:07:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"425c658258245c03569f64159a2a72f3491d50fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03b9b0b4eeafde69242c8114b0c4154da4b20f8f","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-34756-fix-filescan-equality-check-3.0","ref":"SPARK-34756-fix-filescan-equality-check-3.0","sha":"03b9b0b4eeafde69242c8114b0c4154da4b20f8f","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add new expression `MultiplyDTInterval` which multiplies a `DayTimeIntervalType` expression by a `NumericType` expression including ByteType, ShortType, IntegerType, LongType, FloatType, DoubleType, DecimalType.\r\n2. Extend binary arithmetic rules to support `numeric * day-time interval` and `day-time interval * numeric`.\r\n3. Invoke `DoubleMath.roundToInt` in `double/float * year-month interval`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires such operation over day-time intervals:\r\n<img width=\"667\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-03-22 at 16 33 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1580697/111997810-77d1eb80-8b2c-11eb-951d-e43911d9c5db.png\">\r\n\r\n### Does

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBoth local limit and global limit define the output partitioning and output ordering in the same way and this is duplicated (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/limit.scala#L159-L175 ). We can move the output partitioning and ordering into their parent trait - `BaseLimitExec`. This is doable as `BaseLimitExec` has no more other child class. This is a minor code refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nClean up the code a little bit. Better readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nPure refactoring. Rely on existing unit tests.","created_at":"2021-03-24T07:30:57Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T17:12:30Z","closed_at":"2021-03-24T14:06:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8514d0107ca8e656ddad1f29ded8804bbfa85548","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/511fe6553eb1549c558be46e086d2dc413f93dd9","head":{"label":"c21:limit-cleanup","ref":"limit-cleanup","sha":"511fe6553eb1549c558be46e086d2dc413f93dd9","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror
