\r\n\r\nThe poll method will also not clear the records list automatically. Letting the consumer position control which records are returned from poll is more similar to how the real consumer works, so e.g. a test can put a message in the consumer, poll for it, seek to the beginning and get the message out again. If tests need to delete the records entirely, they can still do so through a new method.\r\n\r\nA few of the methods in MockConsumer were also returning mutable internal maps/lists.

of the topic.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nAllow the converter with and without schemas to output a NULL byte value in order to have a proper tombstone message\r\nWhen it's regarding to get this data into a connect record, the approach is the same as when the payload looks like `\"{ \"schema\": null, \"payload\": null }\"`, this way the sink connectors can maintain their functionality and reduces the BCC\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nThe first commit only introduces the fix and shows that **possibly** no BC break is introduced; Please help me confirm that's the case\r\nThe second commit introduce tests for the fix\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThe fix could also be done at `fromConnectData`, but I felt like since the last path within the change is `convertToJsonWithEnvelope` this could avoid future internal calls to be also be

looking into KAFKA-7657, I found there are a few loopholes in this logic:\r\n\r\n1. We kept a map of thread-name to thread-state and a global-thread state at the KafkaStreams instance-level, in addition to the instance state itself. `stateLock` is used when accessing the instance state, however when we are in the thread state change callback, we are accessing both the thread-states as well as the instance state at the same time in the callers of `setState` without a lock, which is vulnerable to concurrent multi-stream threads. The fix is a) introduce a `threadStatesLock` in addition to the `stateLock`, which should always be grabbed to modify the thread-states map before the `stateLock` for modifying the instance level; and we also defer the checking of the instance-level state inside the `setState` call.\r\n\r\n2. When transiting to state.RUNNING, we check if all threads are either in RUNNING or DEAD state, this is because some threads maybe dead at the rebalance period but we should still proceed to RUNNING if the rest of threads are still transiting to RUNNING.\r\n\r\n3. Added unit test for 2) above. Also simplified another test as a nit change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

is a follow-up PR from the previous PR https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5779, where KTabeSource always get old values from the store even if sendOldValues. It gets me to make a pass over all the KTable/KStreamXXX processor to push the `sendOldValues` at the callers in order to avoid unnecessary store reads. \r\n\r\n1. More details: `ForwardingCacheFlushListener` and `TupleForwarder` both need sendOldValues as parameters. \r\na. For `ForwardingCacheFlushListener` it is not needed at all, since its callers `XXXCachedStore` already use the sendOldValues values passed from `TupleForwarder` to avoid getting old values from underlying stores. \r\nb. For `TupleForwarder`, it actually only need to pass the boolean flag to the cached store; and then it does not need to keep it as its own variable since the cached store already respects the boolean to pass null or the actual value..\r\n\r\n2. The only other minor bug I found from the pass in on KTableJoinMerge, where we always pass old values and ignores sendOldValues.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

were several reported incidents where the log is rolled to a new segment with the same base offset as an active segment, causing KafkaException: Trying to roll a new log segment for topic partition X-N with start offset M while it already exists. From what I have investigated so far, this happens to an empty log segment where there is long idle time before the next append and somehow we get to a state where offsetIndex.isFull() returns true due to _maxEntries == 0. This PR recovers from the state where the active segment is empty and we try to roll to a new segment with the same offset: we delete segment and recreate it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

tool produces a dummy record in case the topic does not exist. This behavior was introduced in this PR https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5319  as part of updating the tool to use latest consumer API. However, if we run the tool with producer acks == 1, the high watermark may not be updated before we reset consumer offsets to latest. In rare cases when this happens, the tool will throw an exception in the for loop where the consumer will unexpectedly consume the dummy record. As a result, we occasionally see Benchmark.test_end_to_end_latency system test failures.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks if topic exists, and creates the topic using AdminClient if it does not exist.\r\n\r\n###
