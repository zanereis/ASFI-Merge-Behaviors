For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, we support `create view v as select null` with in-memory but failed in hive. We try to forbid this in [#29152](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29152), however `df.createTempView` is already a use case of `NullType` with in-memory. So it seems better to keep this behavior consistent with hive.\r\n\r\nSome error msg with `create view v as select null`.\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Cannot recognize hive type string: null, column: NULL\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$.getSparkSQLDataType(HiveClientImpl.scala:999)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$.$anonfun$verifyColumnDataType$1(HiveClientImpl.scala:1021)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:941)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator.foreach$(Iterator.scala:941)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1429)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike.foreach(IterableLike.scala:74)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike.foreach$(IterableLike.scala:73)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.foreach(StructType.scala:102)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, user can create view with null type in Hive.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `command -v` in non-Window operating systems instead of executing the given command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. `command` is POSIX-compatible\r\n    - **POSIX.1-2017**:  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/command.html\r\n2. `command` is faster and safer than the direct execution\r\n    - `command` doesn't invoke another process.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sys.process.Process(\"ls\").run().exitValue()\r\nLICENSE\r\nNOTICE\r\nbin\r\ndoc\r\nlib\r\nman\r\nres1: Int = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The existing way behaves inconsistently.\r\n    - `rm` cannot be checked.\r\n\r\n**AS-IS**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sys.process.Process(\"rm\").run().exitValue()\r\nusage: rm [-f | -i] [-dPRrvW] file ...\r\n       unlink file\r\nres0: Int = 64\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TO-BE**\r\n```\r\nWelcome to Scala 2.13.3 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_262).\r\nType in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.\r\nscala> sys.process.Process(Seq(\"sh\", \"-c\", s\"command -v ls\")).run().exitValue()\r\n/bin/ls\r\nval res1: Int = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. The existing logic is already broken in Scala 2.13 environment because it hangs like the following.\r\n```scala\r\n$ bin/scala\r\nWelcome to Scala 2.13.3 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_262).\r\nType in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.\r\n\r\nscala> sys.process.Process(\"cat\").run().exitValue() // hang here.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Although this is inside `main` source directory, this is used for testing purpose.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep testCommandAvailable | grep -v 'def testCommandAvailable'\r\ncore/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/PipedRDDSuite.scala:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `json4s` to from 3.6.6 to 3.7.0-M5 for Scala 2.13 support at Apache Spark 3.1.0 on December. We will upgrade to the latest `json4s` around November.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`json4s` starts to support Scala 2.13 since v3.7.0-M4.\r\n- https://github.com/json4s/json4s/issues/660\r\n- https://github.com/json4s/json4s/commit/b013af8e757ee15c15a6a1f19c672f7e7044a868\r\n\r\nOld `json4s` causes many UT failures with `NoSuchMethodException`.\r\n```scala\r\n Cause: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: scala.collection.immutable.Seq$.apply(scala.collection.Seq)\r\n  at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1786)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following is one example.\r\n```scala\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl core --am -Pscala-2.13 -Dtest=none

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. **Scala 2.12**: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action with the existing tests.\r\n2. **Scala 2.13**: Do the following manually at least.\r\n```scala\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/mvn test -pl core --am -Pscala-2.13 -Dtest=none

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce an ability to override the datasource implementation via configuration.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose I have a custom CSV datasource implementation called \"my_csv\". One way to use it is:\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"my_csv\").load(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the source data is the same format (CSV), you should be able to override the default implementation.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, now you can do the following:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.datasource.override.csv\", \"my_csv\")\r\nval df = spark.read.csv(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has a benefit that the user doesn't have to change the application code to try out a new datasource implementation for the same source format.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIntroduces a new hook to override datasource implementation via configuration\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, you can now override datasource implementation via config as described above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince Scala 2.13, `HashMap` is changed to become a final in the future and `.withDefault` is recommended.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCheck that there are not duplicate column names on the same level (top level or nested levels) in reading from in-built datasources Parquet, ORC, Avro and JSON. If such duplicate columns exist, throw the exception:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Found duplicate column(s) in the data schema:\r\n```\r\nThe check takes into account the SQL config `spark.sql.caseSensitive` (`false` by default).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make handling of duplicate nested columns is similar to handling of duplicate top-level columns i. e. output the same error:\r\n```Scala\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Found duplicate column(s) in the data schema: `camelcase`\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking of top-level duplicates was introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17758.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to speed up `MapStatus` deserialization by 5~18% with the latest RoaringBitmap `0.9.0` and new APIs. Note that we focus on `deserialization` time because `serialization` occurs once while `deserialization` occurs many times.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current version is too old. We had better upgrade it to get the performance improvement and bug fixes.\r\nAlthough `MapStatusesSerDeserBenchmark` is synthetic, the benchmark result is updated with this patch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action.","created_at":"2020-07-25T09:32:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-26T10:24:40Z","closed_at":"2020-07-25T15:07:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d936ae0813030f5840fded65a6b40b71fcf3d083","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f784f2c4d8f3b341d2fec8c0dccb85cc9d616476","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-ROAR","ref":"SPARK-ROAR","sha":"f784f2c4d8f3b341d2fec8c0dccb85cc9d616476","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8e36a8f33fb9d20c481e9eeb0ea8155aa1569439","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to initialize `numNonEmptyBlocks` in `HighlyCompressedMapStatus.readExternal`.\r\n\r\nIn Scala 2.12, this is initialized to `-1` via the following.\r\n```scala\r\nprotected def this() = this(null, -1, null, -1, null, -1)  // For deserialization only\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Scala 2.13, this causes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the manual port of `heapq3.py` introduced from SPARK-3073. The main reason of this was to support Python 2.6 and 2.7 because Python 2's `heapq.merge()` doesn't not support `key` and `reverse`.\r\n\r\nSee\r\n- https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#heapq.merge in Python 2\r\n- https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/heapq.html#heapq.merge in Python 3\r\n\r\nSince we dropped the Python 2 at SPARK-32138, we can remove this away.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo remove unnecessary codes. Also, we can leverage bug fixes made in Python 3.x at `heapq`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`DAGSchedulerSuite` exists some issue:\r\n`afterEach` and `init` are called when the `SparkConf` of the default `SparkContext` has no configuration that the test case must set. This causes the `SparkContext` initialized in `beforeEach` to be discarded without being used, resulting in waste. On the other hand, the flexibility to add configurations to `SparkConf` should be addressed by the test framework.\r\n\r\nTest suites inherits `LocalSparkContext` can be simplified.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce overhead about init `SparkContext`.\r\nRewrite the test framework to support apply specified spark configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis test tries to fix the flakyness of BlockManagerDecommissionIntegrationSuite. \r\n\r\n### Description of the problem\r\n\r\nMake the block manager decommissioning test be less flaky\r\n\r\nAn interesting failure happens when migrateDuring = true (and persist or shuffle is true):\r\n- We schedule the job with tasks on executors 0, 1, 2.\r\n- We wait 300 ms and decommission executor 0.\r\n- If the task is not yet done on executor 0, it will now fail because\r\n   the block manager won't be able to save the block. This condition is\r\n   easy to trigger on a loaded machine where the github checks run.\r\n- The task with retry on a different executor (1 or 2) and its shuffle\r\n   blocks will land there.\r\n- No actual block migration happens here because the decommissioned\r\n   executor technically failed before it could even produce a block.\r\n\r\nTo remove the above race, this change replaces the fixed wait for 300 ms to wait for an actual task to succeed. When a task has succeeded, we know its blocks would have been written for sure and thus its executor would certainly be forced to migrate those blocks when it is decommissioned.\r\n\r\nThe change always decommissions an executor on which a real task finished successfully instead of picking the first executor. Because the system may choose to schedule nothing on the first executor and instead run the two tasks on one executor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have had bad luck with BlockManagerDecommissionIntegrationSuite and it has failed several times on my PRs. So fixing it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, unit test only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGithub checks. Ran this test 100 times, 10 at a time in parallel in a script.","created_at":"2020-07-25T00:07:10Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T02:36:55Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T19:00:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46ed4911494014944ae0cc214948f5f81cb0cbfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1b469fb0101730916c9327d22cf5b3e27bf4eadb","head":{"label":"agrawaldevesh:block-manager-decom-flaky","ref":"block-manager-decom-flaky","sha":"1b469fb0101730916c9327d22cf5b3e27bf4eadb","user":{"login":"agrawaldevesh","id":20564223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20564223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh","html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277609140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzc2MDkxNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"agrawaldevesh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"agrawaldevesh","id":20564223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20564223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh","html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvide a generic mechanism for plugins to inject rules into the AQE \"query prep\" stage that happens before query stage creation.\r\n\r\nThis goes along with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32332 where the current AQE implementation doesn't allow for users to properly extend it for columnar processing. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that we create new query stages but we do not have access to the parent plan of the new query stage so certain things can not be determined because you have to know what the parent did.  With this change it would allow you to add TAGs to be able to figure out what is going on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test is included in the PR.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-24T14:58:39Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T09:13:10Z","closed_at":"2020-07-24T18:04:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4e4cf37fe207fd1230374f8bc96fbe4686cd539","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/182d4f93e20a359ea42620eaf054b3d74c1ab746","head":{"label":"andygrove:insert-aqe-rule","ref":"insert-aqe-rule","sha":"182d4f93e20a359ea42620eaf054b3d74c1ab746","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCall collect on RDD before calling foreach so that it sends the result to the driver node and print it on this node's stdout.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSome RDDs in this example (e.g., precision, recall) call println without calling collect.\r\nIf the job is under local mode, it sends the data to the driver node and prints the metrics on the driver's stdout.\r\nHowever if the job is under cluster mode, the job prints the metrics on the executor's stdout.\r\nIt seems inconsistent compared to the other metrics nothing to do with RDD (e.g., auPRC, auROC) since these metrics always output the result on the driver's stdout.\r\nAll of the metrics should output its result on the driver's stdout.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, we will raise `ArithmeticException` instead of giving the wrong answer if overflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR uses `python3` instead of `python3.6` executable as a fallback in `IntegratedUDFTestUtils`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, GitHub Actions skips pandas UDFs. Python 3.8 is installed explicitly but somehow `python3.6` looks available in GitHub Actions build environment by default.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - udf/postgreSQL/udf-case.sql - Scalar Pandas UDF is skipped because pyspark,pandas and/or pyarrow were not available in [python3.6]. !!! IGNORED !!!\r\n...\r\n[info] - udf/postgreSQL/udf-select_having.sql - Scalar Pandas UDF is skipped because pyspark,pandas and/or pyarrow were not available in [python3.6]. !!! IGNORED !!!\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt was chosen as `python3.6` for Jenkins to pick one Python explicitly; however, looks we're already using `python3` here and there.\r\n\r\nIt will also reduce the overhead to fix when we deprecate or drop Python versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt should be tested in Jenkins and GitHub Actions environments

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`HashRelation` has two separate code paths for unique key look up and non-unique key look up E.g. in its subclass [`UnsafeHashedRelation`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/HashedRelation.scala#L144-L177), unique key look up is more efficient as it does not have e.g. extra `Iterator[UnsafeRow].hasNext()/next()` overhead per row.\r\n\r\n`BroadcastHashJoinExec` has handled unique key vs non-unique key separately in [code-gen path](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/BroadcastHashJoinExec.scala#L289-L321). But the non-codegen path for broadcast hash join and shuffled hash join do not separate it yet, so adding the support here.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nShuffled hash join and non-codegen broadcast hash join still rely on this code path for execution. So this PR will help save CPU for executing this two type of join. Adding codegen for shuffled hash join would be a different topic and I will add it in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32421 .\r\n\r\nRan the same query as [`JoinBenchmark`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/benchmark/JoinBenchmark.scala#L153-L167), with enabling and disabling this feature.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29117 to branch-3.0 as the flakiness was found in branch-3.0 too: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29201#issuecomment-663114741 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29201#issuecomment-663114741\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n\r\n- ~~Don't use `--user` in pip packaging test~~\r\n- ~~Pull `source` out of the subshell, and place it first.~~\r\n- Exclude user sitepackages in Python path during pip installation test\r\n\r\nto address the flakiness of the pip packaging test in Jenkins.\r\n\r\n~~(I think) #29116 caused this flakiness given my observation in the Jenkins log. I had to work around by specifying `--user` but it turned out that it does not properly work in old Conda on Jenkins for some reasons. Therefore, reverting this change back.~~\r\n\r\n(I think) the installation at user site-packages affects other environments created by Conda in the old Conda version that Jenkins has. Seems it fails to isolate the environments for some reasons. So, it excludes user sitepackages in the Python path during the test.\r\n\r\n~~In addition, #29116 also added some fallback logics of `conda (de)activate` and `source (de)activate` because Conda prefers to use `conda (de)activate` now per the official documentation and `source (de)activate` doesn't work for some reasons in certain environments (see also https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7980). The problem was that `source` loads things to the current shell so does not affect the current shell. Therefore, this PR pulls `source` out of the subshell.~~\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I made the analysis purely based on Jenkins machine's log in this PR. It may have a different reason I missed during my observation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the build and tests pass in Jenkins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests should test it

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nreturn an empty list instead of None when calling `df.head()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`df.head()` and `df.head(1)` are inconsistent when df is empty.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. If a user relies on `df.head()` to return None, things like `if df.head() is None:` will be broken.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid using subshell when it activates Conda environment. Looks like it ends up with activating the env within the subshell even if you use `conda` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf you take a close look for GitHub Actions log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Installing dist into virtual env\r\nProcessing ./python/dist/pyspark-3.1.0.dev0.tar.gz\r\nCollecting py4j==0.10.9\r\n Downloading py4j-0.10.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl (198 kB)\r\nUsing legacy setup.py install for pyspark, since package 'wheel' is not installed.\r\nInstalling collected packages: py4j, pyspark\r\n Running setup.py install for pyspark: started\r\n Running setup.py install for pyspark: finished with status 'done'\r\nSuccessfully installed py4j-0.10.9 pyspark-3.1.0.dev0\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nInstalling dist into virtual env\r\nObtaining file:///home/runner/work/spark/spark/python\r\nCollecting py4j==0.10.9\r\n Downloading py4j-0.10.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl (198 kB)\r\nInstalling collected packages: py4j, pyspark\r\n Attempting uninstall: py4j\r\n Found existing installation: py4j 0.10.9\r\n Uninstalling py4j-0.10.9:\r\n Successfully uninstalled py4j-0.10.9\r\n Attempting uninstall: pyspark\r\n Found existing installation: pyspark 3.1.0.dev0\r\n Uninstalling pyspark-3.1.0.dev0:\r\n Successfully uninstalled pyspark-3.1.0.dev0\r\n Running setup.py develop for pyspark\r\nSuccessfully installed py4j-0.10.9 pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks not properly using Conda as it removes the previously installed one when it reinstalls again. \r\nWe should ideally test it with Conda environment as it's intended.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions will test. I also manually tested in my local.","created_at":"2020-07-24T01:08:35Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:43:06Z","closed_at":"2020-07-25T04:09:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61f3163c3feefa15469382ce3458c1a5276feb6b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71193f194758de23794a2bc46d16766e334091d2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32419","ref":"SPARK-32419","sha":"71193f194758de23794a2bc46d16766e334091d2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExit the executor when it has been asked to decommission and there is nothing left for it to do.\r\n\r\nThis is a rebase of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28817\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf we want to use decommissioning in Spark's own scale down we should terminate the executor once finished.\r\nFurthermore, in graceful shutdown it makes sense to release resources we no longer need if we've been asked to shutdown by the cluster manager instead of always holding the resources as long as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe decommissioned executors will exit and the end of decommissioning. This is sort of a user facing change, however decommissioning hasn't been in any releases yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI changed the unit test to not send the executor exit message and still wait on the executor exited message.","created_at":"2020-07-23T21:41:47Z","updated_at":"2020-08-08T22:41:24Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T23:29:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbafd429c14890a521c16149b72137a9b382ce2c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e81c3fc2d0b8c28cd0aedf08a7ea1e86a153ae49","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-31197-exit-execs-redone","ref":"SPARK-31197-exit-execs-redone","sha":"e81c3fc2d0b8c28cd0aedf08a7ea1e86a153ae49","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds recursive query feature to Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nA recursive query is defined using the `WITH RECURSIVE` keywords and referring the name of the common table expression within the query.\r\nThe implementation complies with SQL standard and follows similar rules to other relational databases:\r\n- A query is made of an anchor followed by a recursive term.\r\n- The anchor terms doesn't contain self reference and it is used to initialize the query.\r\n- The recursive term contains a self reference and it is used to expand the current set of rows with new ones.\r\n- The anchor and recursive terms must be joined with each other by `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operators.\r\n- New rows can only be derived from the newly added rows of the previous iteration (or from the initial set of rows of anchor terms). This limitation implies that recursive references can't be used with some of the joins, aggregations or subqueries.\r\n\r\nPlease see `cte-recursive.sql` and `with.sql` for some examples.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR focuses on the minimal working implementation which means:\r\n- SQL recursion is actually loop where the current iteration is computed based on the previous one's result and when an iteration returns no rows the loop is over. The final result is the union of all iteration results. This means that caching intermediate results could speed up the process, but caching was removed from this PR to reduce complexity and can be added back in a follow-up PR.\r\n- A common way to stop SQL recursion is using the LIMIT operator to stop computing more than the required number of rows. LIMIT support was removed from this PR to reduce complexity and can be added back in a follow-up PR.\r\n- Some relational databases are more relaxed in terms how many anchor and recursive terms can be in a recursion. This PR allows the most simple case and allows only 1-1 of them. A follow-up PR can target to relax this limitation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecursive query is an ANSI SQL feature that is useful to process hierarchical data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds recursive query feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs and tests in `cte-recursion.sql` and `with.sql`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of SPARK-32364 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29160, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29191).\r\n\r\nWhen a user have multiple options like `path`, `paTH`, and `PATH` for the same key `path`, `option/options` is indeterministic because `extraOptions` is `HashMap`. This PR aims to use `CaseInsensitiveMap` instead of `HashMap` to fix this bug fundamentally.\r\n\r\nLike the following, DataFrame's `option/options` have been non-deterministic in terms of case-insensitivity because it stores the options at `extraOptions` which is using `HashMap` class.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read\r\n  .option(\"paTh\", \"1\")\r\n  .option(\"PATH\", \"2\")\r\n  .option(\"Path\", \"3\")\r\n  .option(\"patH\", \"4\")\r\n  .load(\"5\")\r\n...\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:\r\nPath does not exist: file:/.../1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR adds the following.\r\n\r\n1. Add an explicit document to `DataFrameReader/DataFrameWriter`.\r\n\r\n2. Add `toMap` to `CaseInsensitiveMap` in order to return `originalMap: Map[String, T]` because it's more consistent with the existing `case-sensitive key names` behavior for the existing code pattern like `AppendData.byName(..., extraOptions.toMap)`. Previously, it was `HashMap.toMap`.\r\n\r\n3. During (2), we need to change the following to keep the original logic using `CaseInsensitiveMap.++`.\r\n```scala\r\n- val params = extraOptions.toMap ++ connectionProperties.asScala.toMap\r\n+ val params = extraOptions ++ connectionProperties.asScala\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, use `.toMap` in the following because `dsOptions.asCaseSensitiveMap()` is used later.\r\n```scala\r\n- val options = sessionOptions ++ extraOptions\r\n+ val options = sessionOptions.filterKeys(!extraOptions.contains(_)) ++ extraOptions.toMap\r\n  val dsOptions = new CaseInsensitiveStringMap(options.asJava)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`extraOptions.toMap` is used in several places (e.g. `DataFrameReader`) to hand over `Map[String, T]`. In this case, `CaseInsensitiveMap[T] private (val originalMap: Map[String, T])` had better return `originalMap`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will fix indeterministic behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the existing tests and newly add test cases.","created_at":"2020-07-23T18:38:30Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T23:16:00Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T23:09:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3721ed16fa9c239095c5689d3b86ec6f754fca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29209/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29209/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29209/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/611a29a12daefbe37cabdda05c7f9be0c064ac5e","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-32364-2.4","ref":"SPARK-32364-2.4","sha":"611a29a12daefbe37cabdda05c7f9be0c064ac5e","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-2.4","ref":"branch-2.4","sha":"df930e17fd9c3be02110290b1c68c82c07ee08dd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"SELECT name, avg(age) as avg_age FROM person GROUP BY name\")\r\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"person_a\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT p1.name, p2.avg_age FROM person p1 JOIN person_a p2 ON p1.name = p2.name\")\r\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"person_b\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM person_a UNION SELECT * FROM person_b\")\r\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"person_c\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT p1.name, p2.avg_age FROM person_c p1 JOIN person_c p2 ON p1.name = p2.name\").show()\r\n```\r\nWhen executing the above query, we'll hit the error:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n[info]   Failed to analyze query: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Resolved attribute(s) avg_age#231 missing from name#223,avg_age#218,id#232,age#234,name#233 in operator !Project [name#233, avg_age#231]. Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: avg_age. Please check if the right attribute(s) are used.;;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plan below is the problematic plan which is the right plan of a `Join` operator. And, it has conflict plans comparing to the left plan. In this problematic plan, the first `Aggregate` operator (the one under the first child of `Union`) becomes a conflict plan compares to the left one and has a rewrite attribute pair as  `avg_age#218` -> `avg_age#231`. With the current `dedupRight` logic, we'll first replace this `Aggregate` with a new one, and then rewrites the attribute `avg_age#218` from bottom to up. As you can see, projects with the attribute `avg_age#218` of the second child of the `Union` can also be replaced with `avg_age#231`(That means we also rewrite attributes for non-ancestor plans for the conflict plan). Ideally, the attribute `avg_age#218` in the second `Aggregate` operator (the one under the second child of `Union`) should also be replaced. But it didn't because it's an `Alias` while we only rewrite `Attribute` yet.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactoring of `JsonFilters`:\r\n- Add an assert to the `skipRow` method to check the input `index`\r\n- Move checking of the SQL config `spark.sql.json.filterPushdown.enabled` from `JsonFilters` to `JacksonParser`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The assert should catch incorrect usage of `JsonFilters`\r\n2. The config checking out of `JsonFilters` makes it consistent with `OrderedFilters` (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29145).\r\n3. `JsonFilters` can be used by other datasource in the future and don't depend from the JSON configs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29057 which disabled `crossPaths` in order to run JUnit tests together properly when an SBT project is explicitly selected. For example, if you run the tests via `sbt kvstore/test`, it didn't run relevant JUnit tests before disabling `crossPaths`, see also https://github.com/sbt/junit-interface/issues/35.\r\n\r\nDisabling `crossPaths` removes a Scala version directory to the build output, for example,\r\n\r\nfrom:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntarget/scala-2.12/classes\r\ntarget/scala-2.12/test-classes\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntarget/classes\r\ntarget/test-classes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe previous PR disabled it only for the main SBT projects that relates to the main codes only, and did not disable for other SBT projects such as Unidoc, assembly and examples to minimise the side effects. For example, the jars from the assembly output are still placed under `target/scala-2.12` properly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I realised that later there are some codes dependent on this `scala-2.12` paths in the tests and main codes, for example, `SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES` or some PySpark tests that require some classes present in JVM (you can search the instances via `git grep -r \"target/scala-\"`). Although these are mostly for dev purposes, I would like to minimise such side effects by only disabling `crossPaths` in GitHub Actions as a temporary workaround for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\nIn the long run, I think we should disable `crossPaths` for all projects including Unidoc, assembly and etc.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the only advantage of enabling `crossPaths` is to support SBT's cross building, for example,`sbt +package` to build multiple Scala versions at once (which Maven build doesn't as far as I know). Up to my knowledge, we're not supporting this at all, and will be very difficult to support considering that we're currently relying on the conversion from poms to SBT projects.  More importantly, we're using Maven to make the releases.\r\n\r\nThere was already a try at SPARK-14574 before which was resolved as a `Later`. Probably, we should revisit it soon to solve JUnit testing problem together.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo minimise the side effects from `crossPaths` such as `SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES` or tests that run conditionally if the test classes are present in PySpark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuild/sbt -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver -DskipTests clean test:package\r\n./python/run-tests --python-executable=python3 --testname=\"pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe QueryExecutionListenerTests\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nGITHUB_ACTIONS=1 build/sbt -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver -DskipTests clean test:package\r\nGITHUB_ACTIONS=1 ./python/run-tests --python-executable=python3 --testname=\"pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe QueryExecutionListenerTests\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 version is: Python 3.7.7\r\nStarting test(python3): pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe QueryExecutionListenerTests\r\nFinished test(python3): pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe QueryExecutionListenerTests (0s) ... 2 tests were skipped\r\nTests passed in 0 seconds\r\n\r\nSkipped tests in pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe QueryExecutionListenerTests with python3:\r\n      test_query_execution_listener_on_collect (pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe.QueryExecutionListenerTests) ...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLog error/warn message only once at the server-side for both sync and async modes\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/b151194299f5ba15e0d9d8d7d2980fd164fe0822 we make the error logging for  SparkExecuteStatementOperation with `runInBackground=true` not duplicated, but the operations with runInBackground=false and other metadata operation still will be log twice which happened in the operation's `runInternal` method and ThriftCLIService.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to reflect the logic to get a unified error handling approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, when spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.async=false and people call sync APIs the error message will be logged only once at server-side.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nlocally verified the result in target/unit-test.log\r\n\r\nadd unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-23T12:57:51Z","updated_at":"2020-08-24T16:01:46Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T06:44:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e03c9fe8f3eb8e96ae6602228455c31c8b727887","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50113145de4d9c7247d2a8af6e1e4f1087d19548","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-32412","ref":"SPARK-32412","sha":"50113145de4d9c7247d2a8af6e1e4f1087d19548","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a71233f89d79c4d9a9c806b9ec0c082ddc81e204","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

In most cases, users do not want this,  but just want to restore one or a small group of settings.\r\nThe SET command can work as a workaround for this, but you have to keep the defaults in your mind or by temp variables, which turns out not very convenient to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nHive supports this:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineExample\r\n\r\nreset <key> | Resets the value of a particular configuration variable (key) to the default value.Note: If you misspell the variable name, Beeline will not show an error.\r\n-- | --\r\n\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL supports this too\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-reset.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, reset can restore one configuration now\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd new unit tests.","created_at":"2020-07-23T08:05:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T15:10:10Z","closed_at":"2020-07-24T16:13:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a94463956226b6a77f049d5a5eac427593686e87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2bb6d7895a826f60d884fec7ffd5d93843b838a4","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-32406","ref":"SPARK-32406","sha":"2bb6d7895a826f60d884fec7ffd5d93843b838a4","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7b66882c9d90fc060206de52735a8a80c0cf104f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate the following function related commands to use `UnresolvedFunc` to resolve function identifier:\r\n- DROP FUNCTION\r\n- DESCRIBE FUNCTION\r\n- SHOW FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n`DropFunctionStatement`, `DescribeFunctionStatement` and `ShowFunctionsStatement` logical plans are replaced with `DropFunction`, `DescribeFunction` and `ShowFunctions` logical plans respectively, and each contains `UnresolvedFunc` as its child so that it can be resolved in `Analyzer`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMigrating to the new resolution framework, which resolves `UnresolvedFunc` in `Analyzer`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe message of exception thrown when a catalog is resolved to v2 has been merged to:\r\n`function is only supported in v1 catalog`\r\n\r\nPreviously, it printed out the command used. E.g.,:\r\n`CREATE FUNCTION is only supported in v1 catalog`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-07-23T04:09:08Z","updated_at":"2020-07-29T03:56:06Z","closed_at":"2020-07-29T03:56:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a48f29726e5185561059465d2dfd5cb9fe4c67d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29198/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29198/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29198/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c662619bd00e74d4f683fcb565868bf72e4890d6","head":{"label":"imback82:function_framework","ref":"function_framework","sha":"c662619bd00e74d4f683fcb565868bf72e4890d6","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nGenerally, distributed jobs have two stages of committing files: committing task's output files and committing job's output files. If one attempt fails, another attempt will try to run the task again, after all tasks succeed, the job will commit the output of all tasks.\r\nBut now if we run a dynamic partition overwrite job, for example, `INSERT OVERWRITE table dst partition(part) SELECT * from src`, then if one of the final stage tasks fails, the job will fail.\r\nThe first task attempt  datawriter in final stage writes the output data directly to spark stage directory.If the first taskattempt fails, the second taskattempt datawriter will fail to setup, because the task's output file is already exists. Then the job will fail.\r\nTherefore, I think we should write the temporary data to the task attempt's work directory, and commit result files after the task attempt succeed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix in case one dynamic partition data writer of final stage tasks fails .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #29138 which added overload `slice` function to accept `Column` for `start` and `length` in Scala.\r\n\r\nThis PR is updating the equivalent Python function to accept `Column` as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNow that Scala version accepts `Column`, Python version should also accept it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, PySpark users will also be able to pass Column object to `start` and `length` parameter in `slice` function.\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf an executor is lost, the `DAGScheduler` handles the executor loss by removing the executor but does not unregister its outputs if the external shuffle service is used. However, if the node on which the executor runs is lost, the shuffle service may not be able to serve the shuffle files.\r\nIn such a case, when fetches from the executor's outputs fail in the same stage, the `DAGScheduler` again removes the executor and by right, should unregister its outputs. It doesn't because the epoch used to track the executor failure has not increased.\r\n\r\nWe track the epoch for failed executors that result in lost file output separately, so we can unregister the outputs in this scenario. The idea to track a second epoch is due to Attila Zsolt Piros.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout the changes, the loss of a node could require two stage attempts to recover instead of one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test. This test fails without the change and passes with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes the support for char(n)[], character(n)[] data types. Prior to this change, a user would get `Unsupported type ARRAY` exception when attempting to interact with the table with such types.\r\n\r\nThe description is a bit more detailed in the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32393) itself, but the crux of the issue is that postgres driver names char and character types as `bpchar`. The relevant driver code can be found [here](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/master/pgjdbc/src/main/java/org/postgresql/jdbc/TypeInfoCache.java#L85-L87). `char` is very likely to be still needed, as it seems that pg makes a distinction between `char(1)` and `char(n > 1)` as per [this code](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/b7fd9f3cef734b4c219e2f6bc6c19acf68b2990b/pgjdbc/src/main/java/org/postgresql/core/Oid.java#L64).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor completeness of the pg dialect support.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, successful reads of tables with bpchar array instead of errors after this fix. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T16:29:44Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T13:32:52Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T02:03:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b37a6115deeadcb670e21647ae7756a5c3eaa54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1000377777d580766ec2db4ffc230dae045838e0","head":{"label":"kujon:fix_postgres_bpchar_array_support","ref":"fix_postgres_bpchar_array_support","sha":"1000377777d580766ec2db4ffc230dae045838e0","user":{"login":"kujon","id":503380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/503380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon","html_url":"https://github.com/kujon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":281712355,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODE3MTIzNTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"kujon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kujon","id":503380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/503380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon","html_url":"https://github.com/kujon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kujon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kujon/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29160. We already removed the indeterministicity. This PR aims the following for the existing code base.\r\n1. Add an explicit document to `DataFrameReader/DataFrameWriter`.\r\n\r\n2. Add `toMap` to `CaseInsensitiveMap` in order to return `originalMap: Map[String, T]` because it's more consistent with the existing `case-sensitive key names` behavior for the existing code pattern like `AppendData.byName(..., extraOptions.toMap)`. Previously, it was `HashMap.toMap`.\r\n\r\n3. During (2), we need to change the following to keep the original logic using `CaseInsensitiveMap.++`.\r\n```scala\r\n- val params = extraOptions.toMap ++ connectionProperties.asScala.toMap\r\n+ val params = extraOptions ++ connectionProperties.asScala\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Additionally, use `.toMap` in the following because `dsOptions.asCaseSensitiveMap()` is used later.\r\n```scala\r\n- val options = sessionOptions ++ extraOptions\r\n+ val options = sessionOptions.filterKeys(!extraOptions.contains(_)) ++ extraOptions.toMap\r\n  val dsOptions = new CaseInsensitiveStringMap(options.asJava)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`extraOptions.toMap` is used in several places (e.g. `DataFrameReader`) to hand over `Map[String, T]`. In this case, `CaseInsensitiveMap[T] private (val originalMap: Map[String, T])` had better return `originalMap`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action with the existing tests and newly add test case at `JDBCSuite`.","created_at":"2020-07-22T16:05:59Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T13:28:45Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T13:28:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c62a18c5d884b799b926b7f1cbe3b4a1511213b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29191/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29191/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29191/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/81ac6c614c16e8d3c43ff14888216a797df04275","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-32364-3","ref":"SPARK-32364-3","sha":"81ac6c614c16e8d3c43ff14888216a797df04275","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cd16a10475c110dbf5739a37e8f5f103b5541234","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to redesign the PySpark documentation.\r\n\r\nI made a demo site to make it easier to review: https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/index.html.\r\n\r\nHere is the initial draft for the final PySpark docs shape: https://hyukjin-spark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.\r\n\r\nIn more details, this PR proposes:\r\n1. Use [pydata_sphinx_theme](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pydata-sphinx-theme) theme - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) and [Koalas](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) use this theme. The CSS overwrite is ported from Koalas. The colours in the CSS were actually chosen by designers to use in Spark.\r\n2. Use the Sphinx option to separate `source` and `build` directories as the documentation pages will likely grow. \r\n3. Port current API documentation into the new style. It mimics Koalas and pandas to use the theme most effectively.\r\n\r\n    One disadvantage of this approach is that you should list up APIs or classes; however, I think this isn't a big issue in PySpark since we're being conservative on adding APIs. I also intentionally listed classes only instead of functions in ML and MLlib to make it relatively easier to manage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOften I hear the complaints, from the users, that current PySpark documentation is pretty messy to read - https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html compared other projects such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) and [Koalas](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\r\n\r\nIt would be nicer if we can make it more organised instead of just listing all classes, methods and attributes to make it easier to navigate.\r\n\r\nAlso, the documentation has been there from almost the very first version of PySpark. Maybe it's time to update it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, PySpark API documentation will be redesigned.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and the demo site was made to show.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T10:09:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:06:08Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T08:49:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a312c4e48ea1cd19db15ff851672a85f902a6c27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29188/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29188/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29188/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6d011737aba77e7eca41c1b65d6588764856797","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32179","ref":"SPARK-32179","sha":"d6d011737aba77e7eca41c1b65d6588764856797","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`UninterruptibleThread` running functionality is baked into `KafkaOffsetReader` which can be extracted into a class. The main intention is to simplify `KafkaOffsetReader` in order to make easier to solve SPARK-32032. In this PR I've made this extraction without functionality change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`UninterruptibleThread` running functionality is baked into `KafkaOffsetReader`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf an executor is lost, the `DAGScheduler` handles the executor loss by removing the executor but does not unregister its outputs if the external shuffle service is used. However, if the node on which the executor runs is lost, the shuffle service may not be able to serve the shuffle files.\r\nIn such a case, when fetches from the executor's outputs fail in the same stage, the `DAGScheduler` again removes the executor and by right, should unregister its outputs. It doesn't because the epoch used to track the executor failure has not increased.\r\n\r\nWe track the epoch for failed executors that result in lost file output separately, so we can unregister the outputs in this scenario. The idea to track a second epoch is due to Attila Zsolt Piros.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test. This test fails without the change and passes with it.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-22T05:12:40Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T19:57:22Z","closed_at":"2020-08-04T19:57:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec0dd5a0293351d0a8746f3badb932d460c186fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/580beda3de96b1843c8d72c766092e1aa34ce1b4","head":{"label":"wypoon:SPARK-32003-2.4","ref":"SPARK-32003-2.4","sha":"580beda3de96b1843c8d72c766092e1aa34ce1b4","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108919243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg5MTkyNDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wypoon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon/spark","description":"Mirror

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

This PR is only enabling the check, so we can check annotation that are supplied in follow up PR's.\r\n\r\n## Annotation troubles\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the type checker has some issues with Spark's `@since` annotation.\r\n```\r\n@property  # type: ignore\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is very ugly, hopepfuly there will be a setting in the future to disable this check on a global level. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1362\r\n\r\n## Abstractproperty\r\n\r\nReplaced [abstractproperty](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html#abc.abstractproperty) since it is deprecated \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-21T21:04:47Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T19:30:33Z","closed_at":"2020-10-18T17:23:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2224bb77551fa8afca72a7e71136c901ce447f56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2af1250e02b6debdf31409f2a356a1aa3dbee7d9","head":{"label":"Fokko:SPARK-17333","ref":"SPARK-17333","sha":"2af1250e02b6debdf31409f2a356a1aa3dbee7d9","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49888791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTg4ODc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"Fokko/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/spark","description":"Mirror

This appears to be because of the interaction between the following rules: ColumnPruning, InferFiltersFromConstraints, and PredicatePushdown.\r\n\r\nFor the following SQL query:\r\n```\r\ncreate table t1(a int, b int, c int);\r\ncreate table t2(a int, b int, c int);\r\ncreate table t3(a int, b int, c int);\r\nselect count(*) from t1 join t2 join t3 on (t1.a = t2.b and t2.b = t3.c and t3.c = 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe optimized logical plan produced is:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [count(1) AS count(1)#66L]\r\n+- Project\r\n   +- Join Inner, (b#61 = c#65)\r\n      :- Project [b#61]\r\n      :  +- Join Inner, (a#57 = b#61)\r\n      :     :- Project [a#57]\r\n      :     :  +- Filter isnotnull(a#57)\r\n      :     :     +- HiveTableRelation `default`.`t1`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, [a#57, b#58, c#59], Statistics(sizeInBytes=8.0 EiB)\r\n      :     +- Project [b#61]\r\n      :        +- Filter (isnotnull(b#61) AND (b#61 = 1))\r\n      :           +- HiveTableRelation `default`.`t2`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, [a#60, b#61, c#62], Statistics(sizeInBytes=8.0 EiB)\r\n      +- Project [c#65]\r\n         +- Filter (isnotnull(c#65) AND (c#65 = 1))\r\n            +- HiveTableRelation `default`.`t3`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, [a#63, b#64, c#65], Statistics(sizeInBytes=8.0 EiB)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe constraint `a=1` does not get inferred because after column pruning, the InferFiltersFromConstraints rule on the outer join operator only infers `b=1`, since the project operator around the join operator drops the constraint that refers to 'a'. Later, when PushdownPredicates runs again, the `b=1` constraint gets pushed down to relation 'y'.\r\n\r\nIn order to resolve this, this patch proposes replacing the InferFiltersFromConstraints once batch with a batch of InferFiltersFromConstraints and PredicatePushdown to fixed point. With this change, the constraint `b=1` will be inferred and pushed down first. The constraint `a=1` can then be inferred for the inner join operator because `b=1` is now available in order to infer it. Running PredicatePushdown again will push `a=1` to its correct position.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImproves performance of optimization. Also this worked correctly earlier in 2.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a unit test. The test should fail if InferFiltersFromConstraints is run only once.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-20T23:49:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-20T00:44:23Z","closed_at":"2021-02-20T00:44:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d47240fda0502a17a48f8dc4a62f404559c5b05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b3c82af48a8890a951cc3bf5f85d92b698c4d31","head":{"label":"navinvishy:master","ref":"master","sha":"2b3c82af48a8890a951cc3bf5f85d92b698c4d31","user":{"login":"navinvishy","id":3296383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTYzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3296383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy","html_url":"https://github.com/navinvishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":272747303,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzI3NDczMDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"navinvishy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"navinvishy","id":3296383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTYzODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3296383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy","html_url":"https://github.com/navinvishy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navinvishy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/navinvishy/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the readability in the logs of GitHub Actions are not really good. This proposes to add a step in GitHub Actions to show failed tests if any. This new step `\"Failed tests\"` will be triggered if previous step `\"Run tests: ${{ matrix.modules }}\"` has failure.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMore easier to find failed tests in GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. This is for developer-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTest on Github.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1372\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-07-20 at 1 03 11 PM\"

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"SELECT name, avg(age) as avg_age FROM person GROUP BY name\")\r\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"person_a\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT p1.name, p2.avg_age FROM person p1 JOIN person_a p2 ON p1.name = p2.name\") \r\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"person_b\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM person_a UNION SELECT * FROM person_b\")\r\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"person_c\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT p1.name, p2.avg_age FROM person_c p1 JOIN person_c p2 ON p1.name = p2.name\").show()\r\n```\r\nWhen executing the above query, we'll hit the error:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n[info]   Failed to analyze query: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Resolved attribute(s) avg_age#231 missing from name#223,avg_age#218,id#232,age#234,name#233 in operator !Project [name#233, avg_age#231]. Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: avg_age. Please check if the right attribute(s) are used.;;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plan below is the problematic plan which is the right plan of a `Join` operator. And, it has conflict plans comparing to the left plan. In this problematic plan, the first `Aggregate` operator (the one under the first child of `Union`) becomes a conflict plan compares to the left one and has a rewrite attribute pair as  `avg_age#218` -> `avg_age#231`. With the current `dedupRight` logic, we'll first replace this `Aggregate` with a new one, and then rewrites the attribute `avg_age#218` from bottom to up. As you can see, projects with the attribute `avg_age#218` of the second child of the `Union` can also be replaced with `avg_age#231`(That means we also rewrite attributes for non-ancestor plans for the conflict plan). Ideally, the attribute `avg_age#218` in the second `Aggregate` operator (the one under the second child of `Union`) should also be replaced. But it didn't because it's an `Alias` while we only rewrite `Attribute` yet. Therefore, the project above the second `Aggregate` becomes unresolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n:    \r\n:\r\n+- SubqueryAlias p2\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias person_c\r\n      +- Distinct\r\n         +- Union\r\n            :- Project [name#233, avg_age#231]\r\n            :  +- SubqueryAlias person_a\r\n            :     +- Aggregate [name#233], [name#233, avg(cast(age#234 as bigint)) AS avg_age#231]\r\n            :        +- SubqueryAlias person\r\n            :           +- SerializeFromObject [knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).id AS id#232, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).name, true, false) AS name#233, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).age AS age#234]\r\n            :              +- ExternalRDD [obj#165]\r\n            +- Project [name#233 AS name#227, avg_age#231 AS avg_age#228]\r\n               +- Project [name#233, avg_age#231]\r\n                  +- SubqueryAlias person_b\r\n                     +- !Project [name#233, avg_age#231]\r\n                        +- Join Inner, (name#233 = name#223)\r\n                           :- SubqueryAlias p1\r\n                           :  +- SubqueryAlias person\r\n                           :     +- SerializeFromObject [knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).id AS id#232, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).name, true, false) AS name#233, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).age AS age#234]\r\n                           :        +- ExternalRDD [obj#165]\r\n                           +- SubqueryAlias p2\r\n                              +- SubqueryAlias person_a\r\n                                 +- Aggregate [name#223], [name#223, avg(cast(age#224 as bigint)) AS avg_age#218]\r\n                                    +- SubqueryAlias person\r\n                                       +- SerializeFromObject [knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).id AS id#222, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).name, true, false) AS name#223, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$Person, true])).age AS age#224]\r\n                                          +- ExternalRDD [obj#165]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users would no longer hit the error after this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a user have multiple options like `path`, `paTH`, and `PATH` for the same key `path`, `option/options` is non-deterministic because `extraOptions` is `HashMap`. This PR aims to use `CaseInsensitiveMap` instead of `HashMap` to fix this bug fundamentally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike the following, DataFrame's `option/options` have been non-deterministic in terms of case-insensitivity because it stores the options at `extraOptions` which is using `HashMap` class. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read\r\n  .option(\"paTh\", \"1\")\r\n  .option(\"PATH\", \"2\")\r\n  .option(\"Path\", \"3\")\r\n  .option(\"patH\", \"4\")\r\n  .load(\"5\")\r\n...\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:\r\nPath does not exist: file:/.../1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. However, this is a bug fix for the indeterministic cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub Action with newly added test cases.","created_at":"2020-07-20T06:04:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T16:25:36Z","closed_at":"2020-07-22T14:58:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71aa28dc258810453e9756d4554c585ee40f2841","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7ca5da63e1fd5ec3881ec6fef13c7ad9219d5107","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-32364","ref":"SPARK-32364","sha":"7ca5da63e1fd5ec3881ec6fef13c7ad9219d5107","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"29b7eaa43812ecbf1a0a5a406d00fad02a0cc26f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to fix a bug of distinct FIRST/LAST aggregates in v2.4.6;\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT FIRST(DISTINCT v) FROM VALUES 1, 2, 3 t(v)\").show()\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Cannot evaluate expression: false#37\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Unevaluable$class.eval(Expression.scala:258)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.AttributeReference.eval(namedExpressions.scala:226)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.First.ignoreNulls(First.scala:68)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.First.updateExpressions$lzycompute(First.scala:82)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.First.updateExpressions(First.scala:81)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.HashAggregateExec$$anonfun$15.apply(HashAggregateExec.scala:268)\r\n```\r\nA root cause of this bug is that the `Aggregation` strategy replaces a foldable boolean `ignoreNullsExpr` expr with a `Unevaluable` expr (`AttributeReference`) for distinct FIRST/LAST aggregate functions. But, this operation cannot be allowed because the `Analyzer` has checked that it must be foldabe;\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ffdbbae1d465fe2c710d020de62ca1a6b0b924d9/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/First.scala#L74-L76\r\nSo, this PR proposes to change a vriable for `IGNORE NULLS`  from `Expression` to `Boolean` to avoid the case.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29143.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe idea is to improve the performance of HybridStore by adding batch write support to LevelDB. #28412  introduces HybridStore. HybridStore will write data to InMemoryStore at first and use a background thread to dump data to LevelDB once the writing to InMemoryStore is completed. In the comments section of #28412 , @mridulm mentioned using batch writing can improve the performance of this dumping process and he wrote the code of writeAll().\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI did the comparison of the HybridStore switching time between one-by-one write and batch write on an HDD disk. When the disk is free, the batch-write has around 25% improvement, and when the disk is 100% busy, the batch-write has 7x - 10x improvement.\r\n\r\nwhen the disk is at 0% utilization:\r\n| log size, jobs and tasks per job   | original switching time, with write() | switching time with writeAll() |\r\n| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\r\n| 133m, 400 jobs, 100 tasks per job  | 16s                                   | 13s                            |\r\n| 265m, 400 jobs, 200 tasks per job  | 30s                                   | 23s                            |\r\n| 1.3g, 1000 jobs, 400 tasks per job | 136s                                  | 108s                           |\r\n\r\nwhen the disk is at 100% utilization:\r\n| log size, jobs and tasks per job  | original switching time, with write() | switching time with writeAll() |\r\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |\r\n| 133m, 400 jobs, 100 tasks per job | 116s                                  | 17s                            |\r\n| 265m, 400 jobs, 200 tasks per job | 251s                                  | 26s                            |\r\n\r\nI also ran some write related benchmarking tests on LevelDBBenchmark.java and measured the total time of writing 1024 objects.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR modified the parser code to handle invalid usages of a SET/RESET command.\r\nFor example;\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.ansi.enabled true\r\n```\r\nThe above SQL command does not change the configuration value and it just tries to display the value of the configuration \r\n`spark.sql.ansi.enabled true`. This PR disallows using special characters including spaces in the configuration name and reports a user-friendly error instead. In the error message, it tells users a workaround to use quotes or a string literal if they still needs to specify a configuration with them. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SET spark.sql.ansi.enabled true\").show(1, -1)\r\n+---------------------------+-----------+\r\n|key                        |value      |\r\n+---------------------------+-----------+\r\n|spark.sql.ansi.enabled true|<undefined>|\r\n+---------------------------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SET spark.sql.ansi.enabled true\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nExpected format is 'SET', 'SET key', or 'SET key=value'. If you want to include special characters in key, please use quotes, e.g., SET `ke y`=value.(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nSET spark.sql.ansi.enabled true\r\n^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better user-friendly errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded tests in `SparkSqlParserSuite`.","created_at":"2020-07-17T14:52:05Z","updated_at":"2020-08-03T16:31:51Z","closed_at":"2020-08-03T13:00:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43a49c82d30c7ed216883bd772337f9c4835f87c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3065ed9aa5ce232ce4f16335cbf830bd93a73f3f","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-32257","ref":"SPARK-32257","sha":"3065ed9aa5ce232ce4f16335cbf830bd93a73f3f","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support pushed down filters in Avro datasource V1 and V2.\r\n1. Added new SQL config `spark.sql.avro.filterPushdown.enabled` to control filters pushdown to Avro datasource. It is on by default.\r\n2. Renamed `CSVFilters` to `OrderedFilters`.\r\n3. `OrderedFilters` is used in `AvroFileFormat` (DSv1) and in `AvroPartitionReaderFactory` (DSv2)\r\n4. Modified `AvroDeserializer` to return None from the `deserialize` method when pushdown filters return `false`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes improve performance on synthetic benchmarks up to **2** times on JDK 11:\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.7+10-post-Ubuntu-2ubuntu218.04 on Linux 4.15.0-1063-aws\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 v2 @ 2.50GHz\r\nFilters
