Motivation\r\nWhen we can only access the [Athenz ZTS](https://athenz.github.io/athenz/decent_authz_flow/#zts-authz-token-system) server through a forward proxy, we can't use pulsar-client-auth-athenz for an authentication plugin because the current plugin implementation does not support the ztsProxyUrl config of ZTSClient.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nSupport ztsProxyUrl in the pulsar-client-auth-athenz.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn protocol handler's implementation, sometimes it needs to record the current base offset before the actual `asyncAddEntry` call (or the wrapped `PersistentTopic#publishMessages` call), for example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private final PersistentTopic persistentTopic;\r\n    private final Set<Long> pendingBaseOffsets = ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet();\r\n\r\n    private synchronized void add(ByteBuf buffer, int batchSize) {\r\n        final var ml = (ManagedLedgerImpl) persistentTopic.getManagedLedger();\r\n        final var interceptor = (ManagedLedgerInterceptorImpl) ml.getManagedLedgerInterceptor();\r\n        final var baseOffset = interceptor.getIndex(); // the base offset of the next batch to write\r\n        pendingBaseOffsets.add(baseOffset);\r\n        ml.asyncAddEntry(buffer, batchSize, new AsyncCallbacks.AddEntryCallback() {\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void addComplete(Position position, ByteBuf entryData, Object ctx) {\r\n                if (!pendingBaseOffsets.remove(baseOffset)) {\r\n                    log.error(\"Failed to remove {}\", baseOffset);\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the existing implementation won't work as expected that even if the downstream protocol handler guarantees that `asyncAddEntry` is called in a single thread. See https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/a19eaa2b972ab8fe1a2a45e65df1566cf28fb336/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedLedgerImpl.java#L804-L809\r\n\r\nFirst, the code above does not make sense because `internalAsyncAddEntry` itself is already synchronized.\r\n\r\nSecond, to guarantee thread safety for concurrent add operations, switching to another thread is not more efficient than synchronizing the method call. Mostly, it's less efficient because `execute` involves with at least two method calls (`offer` and `poll`) on a `BlockingQueue`, as well as some other operations (like CAS). Take `ArrayBlockingQueue` as example, both its `offer` and `poll` implementations need to acquire the internal lock.\r\n\r\nThird, switching to another thread to execute the core logic is anti-intuitive, especially for modifying some fields that represent the current states. For example, to achieve the same goal at the beginning, I have to write the code like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        ml.getExecutor().execute(() -> {\r\n            pendingBaseOffsets.add(baseOffset);\r\n            ml.asyncAddEntry(buffer, batchSize, callback, ctx);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nSplit `internalAsyncAddEntry` to two methods `beforeAddEntryToQueue` and `afterAddEntryToQueue` that are called before and after adding the operation to `pendingAddEntries`. Then simplify the code by throwing an exception and pass the exception to the callback. It's also more efficient because `OpAddEntry#failed` won't be called in the synchronized block.\r\n\r\nAdd `testBeforeAddEntry` to protect the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nBy default, Pulsar uploads connector JAR and NAR files to Maven Central, but this is unnecessary since connectors are not typically downloaded from Maven Central. Additionally, the large size of the connector files causes timeouts or connection disconnections during the deployment process, as the files exceed Sonatype's size [limitations](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-upload/) for private publishing.\r\n\r\n> Central Publisher Portal currently supports common archive extensions, e.g. zip, jar, tar.gz. While you can only upload one zip at a time per publishing request, the archive can contain more than one component. You can upload an archive up to 1GB in size. If your upload fails with an error or does not result in the creation of a deployment first check to see if the file is less than 1GB in size and that it extracts properly with a local archive extract tool. If the archive is valid and fits into the size limit but still won't upload please email [Central Support](mailto:central-support@sonatype.com) and provide as much supporting information as you can (e.g. screenshots, logs, steps to reproduce).\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Add the `skipDeployConnector` property to skip connector deployment.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n- `B1`: Broker assumes the entry size is `1` when no publishing after the topic was loaded up at the latest time. Otherwise, it uses the average entries size published during the lastest time-range of the topic loaded up.\r\n  - Issue: the average entry size is not prectice for the catch-up read after a topic is reloaded. \r\n- `B2`: The feature `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSize` assumes the entry size is `10kb` when it read nothing. Otherwise, it uses the average entries size of the entries read out before.\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\nRegarding scenario `B2`, it may cause an error `Time-out elapsed while acquiring enough permits on the memory limiter to read from ledger 33, {tenant}/{ns}/persistent/{topic}-partition-0, estimated read size 1937 bytes for 1 entries (check managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSizeInMB)` when there is hundreds topic being read and the exact entry size is very little.\r\n\r\n\r\n### More accurate solutions\r\n- `P0`: Use the exact size of the entries that we attempt to read.\r\n- `P1`: Use the exact size of the ledger that the entries were stored at to estimate the entries' size.\r\n- `P2`: Use the size of the topic that the entries were stored at to estimate the entries' size.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Rather than use the `P2` solution, change the solution to `P1`, and it will never return an inaccurate value such as `1` or `10k`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#23920\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, connections in Pulsar could experience excessive throttling and timeouts due to issues in rate limiting implementation. This was caused by both calculation errors in token bucket logic and problems with clock source handling in virtualized environments. The PR addresses these issues to prevent unintended long throttling periods and connection timeouts.\r\n\r\nTwo key issues are addressed in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Calculation Issue in AsyncTokenBucket:\r\n   - The current token calculation logic is flawed when handling consumed tokens in conjunction with newly added tokens\r\n   - When adding new tokens, the eventually consistent token calculation should happen before limiting the tokens to the bucket capacity limit. Since the new tokens were first added and capped to the capacity limit, this led to a situation where the tokens would become negative when the DefaultMonotonicSnapshotClock's thread was not executed with the expected interval for example due to high CPU usage.\r\n\r\n2. Clock Source Consistency:\r\n   - The current rate limiting implementation in Pulsar broker can be affected by clock source issues where `System.nanoTime()` isn't strictly monotonic and consistent across multiple CPUs\r\n   - This is a known issue in virtualized environments and certain hardware configurations, particularly:\r\n     - Multi-socket systems where each CPU may have its own TSC (Time Stamp Counter)\r\n     - When CPUs are affected by power management features and running at different frequencies\r\n     - The previous solution was impacted since `System.nanoTime()` was read on different threads.\r\n\r\nFor details about timekeeping challenges in virtualized environments, see [Linux kernel documentation on timekeeping](https://docs.kernel.org/virt/kvm/x86/timekeeping.html).\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, when time leaps backwards (for example due to `System.nanoTime` being read by a thread running on a different CPU with unsynchronized TSC), the rate limiter would incorrectly throttle connections for the duration of the time leap. In virtualized environments, the time difference between CPU cores can be significant. Even though such large variances are uncommon, they can cause extended connection timeouts when they occur. This PR significantly improves reliability by preventing such time-variance-induced throttling entirely.\r\n\r\nWhile both forward and backward time leaps can occur in these environments, only backward leaps are explicitly handled. Forward leaps cannot be reliably detected within the eventually consistent logic used in AsyncTokenBucket, and their impact is bounded - at most one rate period (default 1 second) of potential overuse. This design choice favors implementation simplicity and performance while still protecting against the more problematic backward leap case that could cause extended throttling.\r\n\r\nAlthough this PR also covers clock source consistency issues, the most probable root cause for the reported issue #23920 is, however, the calculation logic that was assuming that the DefaultMonotonicSnapshotClock's update thread would always be executing consistently.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. **AsyncTokenBucket improvements**:\r\n   - Fixed token calculation logic to properly handle consumed tokens:\r\n     - Subtract pendingConsumedTokens from new tokens before capping at bucket capacity\r\n     - This ensures correct token balance even when DefaultMonotonicSnapshotClock's update thread is delayed\r\n   - Added comprehensive test coverage for negative balance and eventual consistency scenarios\r\n   - Added test cases to verify proper token bucket behavior under various conditions\r\n\r\n2. **DefaultMonotonicSnapshotClock enhancements**:\r\n   - Implemented a single dedicated thread approach to minimize clock inconsistencies\r\n     - Since System.nanoTime() values can vary slightly between CPUs in multi-core/multi-socket systems, using a single thread ensures time values are read consistently from one CPU\r\n     - This effectively eliminates time variance issues by avoiding cross-CPU clock reads\r\n   - Added handling of backward time leaps in clock source\r\n   - Forward time leaps are intentionally not handled since they cannot be reliably detected in the eventually consistent token bucket logic\r\n   - Forward leaps have minimal impact - at most 1 second of potential overuse with default rate period settings\r\n   - Implemented a low-overhead synchronization mechanism for obtaining consistent clock values when required\r\n   - The implementation is optimized for the common path while providing guarantees when needed\r\n\r\n3. **Rate limiter implementations**:\r\n   - Updated PublishRateLimiterImpl to use proper executor for unthrottling\r\n   - Added error handling for producer unthrottling\r\n   - Modified DispatchRateLimiter and SubscribeRateLimiter to use the monotonic clock instance\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n[AsyncTokenBucketBenchmark](https://github.com/lhotari/pulsar/blob/lh-fix-rate-limiting-connection-timeouts/microbench/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/qos/AsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.java) and [DefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark](https://github.com/lhotari/pulsar/blob/lh-fix-rate-limiting-connection-timeouts/microbench/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/qos/DefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.java) results with JMH demonstrate high throughput (test results with Apple M3 Max):\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                                      Mode  Cnt            Score             Error  Units\r\nAsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.consumeTokensBenchmark001Threads                    thrpt    3    235889973.656 ±    20309920.612  ops/s\r\nAsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.consumeTokensBenchmark010Threads                    thrpt    3   2092331094.972 ±     4154666.893  ops/s\r\nAsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.consumeTokensBenchmark100Threads                    thrpt    3   2423947092.794 ±  1185164011.463  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanos001Threads                 thrpt    3   2031791421.024 ±   281179462.872  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanos010Threads                 thrpt    3  19192224651.486 ±  3492465614.920  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanos100Threads                 thrpt    3  22500950540.764 ± 15333188461.467  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanosRequestSnapshot001Threads  thrpt    3     71259586.362 ±     7340997.362  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanosRequestSnapshot010Threads  thrpt    3     22880953.901 ±     1521620.667  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanosRequestSnapshot100Threads  thrpt    3     16236151.209 ±     5642180.371  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults with Dell XPS 15 7590 i9-9980HK on Linux:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                                      Mode  Cnt            Score            Error  Units\r\nAsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.consumeTokensBenchmark001Threads                    thrpt    3     54622720.701 ±    4953944.847  ops/s\r\nAsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.consumeTokensBenchmark010Threads                    thrpt    3    361746065.391 ±  155306621.346  ops/s\r\nAsyncTokenBucketBenchmark.consumeTokensBenchmark100Threads                    thrpt    3    410425438.712 ±  524401828.340  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanos001Threads                 thrpt    3   1776174139.570 ±  604272160.441  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanos010Threads                 thrpt    3  10480409935.377 ± 3681168439.649  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanos100Threads                 thrpt    3  10572683864.234 ±  783977752.777  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanosRequestSnapshot001Threads  thrpt    3     30378314.738 ±   11642686.027  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanosRequestSnapshot010Threads  thrpt    3    222770085.250 ±   42935412.356  ops/s\r\nDefaultMonotonicSnapshotClockBenchmark.getTickNanosRequestSnapshot100Threads  thrpt    3    287689452.858 ±  153899991.642  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/23910\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nAs the we don't enable `AppendBrokerTimestampMetadataInterceptor` by default, so the entries timestamp is not Strictly Increasing.\r\n\r\nBecause the message timestamp is generated by the clients, the messages from different producers maybe not in global ordering(because of network delay, backpressure, thread scheduling, etc)\r\n\r\nIn a single ledger, they may be arranged in the following way:\r\n[2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8.....]\r\nOverall, they have a self increasing trend, but locally, it may be possible not.\r\n\r\n1. If the `Position` is null when call `PersistentMessageFinder.findMessages`, it will reset the cursor position to `earliest`, see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentSubscription.java#L804-L824\r\n2. If the first entry we read from bk cannot meet the condition, it will return null. see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/OpFindNewest.java#L87-L91\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/22792/commits/823a55dd659da6c1c54dca55d08f92053c91013e#diff-1d1f02c0ae1aed67e77512aebe4d7233705490b14960ee428611462e446861e5R133-R142, we optimized the case of the target entry maybe in the last opening ledger. It's very intuitive but the actual situation is more complicated:\r\n\r\nIf we want to find the message's position whose timestamp is 101, the second-to-last ledger's close timestamp is 100, and the entries's timestamp in the last opening ledger arranged as [102,103,101,104...]\r\nThe first entry's timestamp is greater than 101, so it will not meet the condition of https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentMessageFinder.java#L74-L75, and the return value will be null, the cursor position will be finally set to earliest.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen transaction client is enabled, it gets initialized before the `ServiceUrlProvider` does get a chance to get initialized.\r\n\r\nIf the URL depends on a probe in the `ServiceUrlProvider`, the txn coordinator client is still going to use the default URL instead of getting an updated URL by the probe.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications

What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\nIn dynamic event-driven architectures, the relevance and timing of messages are crucial. Apache Pulsar currently supports delayed message delivery, which is beneficial for scheduling future processing. However, once scheduled, there is no native support to modify or cancel these messages based on changing circumstances. This limitation poses challenges in situations where messages become obsolete before their scheduled delivery or when system conditions change, necessitating the early processing or cancellation of delayed messages.\r\n\r\nIf we want to implement the cancellation of delayed messages at the moment, we can only store the delayed messages to be cancelled in the memory of the consumer side, and if the delay time is too long, there will be many problems.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this PR is to send a message as a MARK message for canceling the target message. **The delay time needs to be one to two windows before the target message, with the window size being `delayedDeliveryTickTimeMillis`.**\r\n\r\nAfter the MARK message arrives, it is stored in a map. When the target message is triggered, it is directly filtered, and finally, both messages will be directly acknowledged.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\nThe following changes were introduced in Pulsar’s message dispatching components to enable delayed message cancellation:\r\n- Extended AbstractBaseDispatcher with the ability to recognize and handle cancellation properties in message metadata.\r\n- Added constants for identifying cancellation-specific properties in message metadata.\r\n\r\nThe key implementation detail involves checking each message for a cancellation marker as it becomes eligible for dispatch. If a message is marked for cancellation, it is dropped from the dispatch queue and its associated resources are cleaned up immediately.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation  \r\n\r\nI encountered an issue when using Kerberos and TLS transport to connect to the broker. The `pulsar-admin` and `pulsar-client` (for HTTP lookup) failed to work as expected.  \r\n\r\nIn the `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationSasl#authenticationStage` method, the broker requests should use the `WebTarget` provided by the `pulsar-admin` or `pulsar-client` HTTP clients. However, the current implementation creates a new HTTP client to construct the `WebTarget`, causing the TLS context to be lost.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the `pulsar-admin` HTTP client is built on `javax.ws.rs` and AHC (Async Http Client), while the `pulsar-client` HTTP client relies only on AHC. To resolve this inconsistency and maintain the TLS context, we need to refactor the `pulsar-client` to provide the required `WebTarget`.  \r\n\r\n### Modifications  \r\n\r\n1. **Package Changes:**  \r\n   - Renamed `org.apache.pulsar.client.admin.internal.http` to `org.apache.pulsar.client.internal.http`.  \r\n   - Moved the renamed package from `pulsar-client-admin` to `pulsar-client`.  \r\n\r\n2. **Refactored HTTP Client:**  \r\n   - Refactored `HttpClient.java` to use `AsyncHttpConnectorProvider` and `AsyncHttpConnector` for a unified and consistent implementation.  \r\n\r\n3. **Fixed Client Calls:**  \r\n   - Updated `pulsar-client` calls to utilize the refactored HTTP client.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#23900\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nDuring work on PR #23901, a severe issue was discovered in the RangeCache implementation. Cache lookups consistently fail when the key used to look up an entry differs from the instance used to put the entry into the cache.\r\n\r\nOne detail of the current broker cache implementation is that it is necessary to configure `cacheEvictionByMarkDeletedPosition=true` so that cached entries don't get evicted by the read position in the managed ledger.\r\n\r\nThis problematic solution was introduced in PR #22789, which aimed to address race conditions in the RangeCache and prevent the use of already recycled object instances. The solution underwent subsequent refactoring in PRs #22814 and #22818. While the value wrapper solution ensures consistency between cached entries and their corresponding keys, the original design primarily focused on the `getRange` and `removeRange` methods.\r\n\r\nIn these method implementations, the ConcurrentSkipListMap's subMap method ensures the original key remains available, preventing the lookup problem from manifesting. This explains why the issue remained undetected for so long, as caching functions correctly in most scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe impact primarily affects single reads, such as initial readings of replay queue entries. Single reads have never added entries to the cache, a bug originally reported as part of #23504 and subsequently moved to #23900.\r\n\r\nIssue #23900 represents a regression.\r\nPrior to the changes introduced in PRs #22789, #22814, and #22818, replay queue entries might have been cached due to previous reads adding entries to the cache. However, the functionality to add replay queue reads to the cache has never been implemented.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- add unit test to verify that an entry can be looked up with a different key instance\r\n- fix the issue in RangeCache implementation\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#23504\r\nFixes #23506\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation before this PR there are multiple problems:\r\n* redelivery (replay) queue reads don't get deduplicated or limited by `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSizeInMB`, reported as #23504\r\n* The `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSizeInMB` limit doesn't work properly if `managedLedgerReadEntryTimeoutSeconds` isn't set, reported as #23506.\r\nIn addition to this, even if `managedLedgerReadEntryTimeoutSeconds` is set, when the limit is reached, there's no queuing and all threads will be retrying in a tight loop to acquire permits. This tight loop causes unnecessary CPU consumption and contention. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nEnhanced permit acquisition:\r\n - Added queuing for pending requests when the limit is reached\r\n - Configurable queue size via `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightPermitsAcquireQueueSize`\r\n - Timeout configuration via `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightPermitsAcquireTimeoutMillis`\r\n - Asynchronous completion of waiting requests to eliminate tight-loop spinning\r\n - Fast path (no queuing) when permits are immediately available\r\n\r\nImproved size estimation:\r\n - Now uses average entry size for more accurate calculations\r\n - Previously used only the latest result's size\r\n\r\n`managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSizeInMB` limit is now applied to replay queue reads\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the Pulsar Dockerfile, amazoncorretto:21-alpine is used as the JDK. \r\nSince Alpine 3.21 has been released, it now contains a JDK built for Alpine 3.21, which might cause compatibility issues.\r\nIt's better to use the build that matches the Alpine version used in Pulsar.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nUse the ALPINE_VERSION argument so that amazoncorretto:21-alpine3.20 image is used, matching the ALPINE_VERSION of Pulsar image.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn Pulsar, consumers can subscribe to multiple topics by pattern or by passing a list of topics. \r\n\r\nHowever, currently, if you need to modify this pattern, it often requires shutting down the existing consumers and creating new consumers with the new pattern.\r\n\r\nThis is because in `MultiTopicConsumer`, each operation is applied to all consumers.\r\n\r\nWe hope to dynamically add or remove certain topics without affecting other subscribed topics.\r\n\r\nWe want a way to unsubscribe or close from certain consumers and add new ones without restarting the entire consumer. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, these changes should remain optional for users who do not need them. \r\n\r\nThis helps developers experiment with dynamic subscription capabilities without cluttering the core consumer interface.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is

#23505\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nSee #23505. It is expected that dispatcherMaxReadSizeBytes also limits replay queue reads. Replay reads are currently unbounded in byte size, which is unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- use `org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.ManagedCursor#applyMaxSizeCap` also in replay queue reads\r\n- add test\r\n  - test uses #23892. That PR should be merged first to clean up the diff of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#23882\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe test class uses a `delayedDeliveryTickTimeMillis` of 1024.\r\nIn the flaky test, a message is produced that should be delivered after 2 seconds. Then, `consumer.receive()` is called with a timeout of 1 second and it is asserted that no message is received. Because of the tick time of 1024ms, the message may already be delivered after 2s-1024ms=976ms. In this case, the test fails because a message is consumed within 1 second.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nConfigure the message to be delivered after 3 seconds (instead of 2).\r\nThis ensures that the message is delivered at the earliest after 3s-1024ms=1976ms. The `consumer.receive()` with 1 second timeout should not receive the message anymore.\r\n\r\nAfter that, there is another `consumer.receive()` whose timeout was increased from 3 to 4 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn some Pulsar tests, there's a need to inject special behaviors such as delays, race conditions or failures.\r\nThe current solutions require using reflection and replacing instances, which results in hard to maintain test code.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Add a solution for Pulsar broker tests that allows to decorate persistent topics, subscriptions, dispatchers\r\nmanaged ledger factory, managed ledger and managed cursor instances.\r\n- Refactor production code so that there are hooks for intercepting the instances in subclasses\r\n- Add a helper methods for creating a Mockito Spy decorator\r\n  - for a dispatcher instance\r\n  - for a ManagedCursorImpl instance\r\n\r\nexample usage for spying on a dispatcher and cursor instance:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void doInitConf() throws Exception {\r\n        super.doInitConf();\r\n        BrokerTestInterceptor.INSTANCE.configure(conf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AfterMethod(alwaysRun = true)\r\n    protected void resetInterceptors() throws Exception {\r\n        BrokerTestInterceptor.INSTANCE.reset();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void

However, this case no longer occurs because we fixed it in [#22860](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/22860/files#diff-0210356c8a88e4efa89eb769a027fa6c166db479dbad8bbbbc704c6ed6e317f5L1007-L1032), ensuring that a topic cannot be removed until it is fully created or closed. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n- You can run `testNoOrphanClosedTopicIfTxnInternalFailed` to reproduce this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

optimal for Pulsar usage since it scans all dependencies for NiFi style documentation.\r\nThe excessive heap usage problem would most like be resolved by https://github.com/apache/nifi-maven/pull/35 . However, the NiFi NAR plugin version including the change requires Java 21. One possibility would be to use a Maven profile activated when Java 21 is used to built Pulsar to use the newer version with the possibility to skip NiFI style documentation generation. That is out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Increase Maven max heap size to 2048M in Pulsar GitHub Actions CI workflows.\r\n- Add workaround for [\"Retried waiting for GCLocker too often allocating\" issue](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8192647)\r\n  - using solution described in https://tech.clevertap.com/demystifying-g1-gc-gclocker-jni-critical-and-fake-oom-exceptions/\r\n    - `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:GCLockerRetryAllocationCount=100`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nConcurrentBitmapSortedLongPairSet doesn't support long right-side values for the added pairs.\r\nThis PR mitigates the issue reported as #23877 by properly implementing the iterator so that values up to 2^32 can be supported. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR optimizes the iterator usable by using RoaringBitmap's PeekableIntIterator which is more performant than using Java's standard Iterator API since PeekableIntIterator uses primitive int values instead of using boxed Integer values.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Optimize ConcurrentBitmapSortedLongPairSet's processItems method by using PeekableIntIterator instead of Java's standard Iterator API.\r\n- Properly use Integer.toUnsignedLong to support values up to 2^32. RoaringBitmap encodes the bit index as an unsigned int. However since Java doesn't support unsigned ints, it's necessary to use Integer.toUnsignedLong to convert the value to a long value.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThere's a test method `BrokerTestUtil.receiveMessages` that is used in some Key_Shared tests to asynchronously read messages from multiple consumers until no more new messages are arrived after a quiet time.\r\nThe current implementation is wrong. Currently each consumer is handled separately and if an individual consumer times out, it would stop waiting for new messages even if a recent message arrived on another consumer. \r\nThis makes some Key_Shared blocking tests to fail with short time outs. This makes some tests flaky or fail when they shouldn't.\r\nInstead, the quiet time condition should be across all active consumers. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFix the quiet time implementation in `BrokerTestUtil.receiveMessages`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn Pulsar tests, in-memory PulsarMockBookKeeper is used to implement BookKeeper client API.\r\nThere hasn't been a way to write realistic tests where there's variable latencies in BookKeeper reads.\r\nAdding tests for various broker cache scenarios will benefit from this test framework improvement.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        // introduce delay to reads\r\n        pulsarTestContext.getMockBookKeeper().setReadHandleInterceptor((ledgerId, firstEntry, lastEntry, entries) -> {\r\n            log.info(\"intercepted read entries for ledgerId {}, firstEntry={}, lastEntry={}\", ledgerId, firstEntry,\r\n                    lastEntry);\r\n            long delayMillis = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextLong(25, 50);\r\n            return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> entries,\r\n                    CompletableFuture.delayedExecutor(delayMillis, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same approach can be used to inject failures.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd `PulsarMockReadHandleInterceptor` interface and implement it in `PulsarMockBookKeeper`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS

#23870\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nSee #23870 for details. It was possible to reproduce a racecondition that caused out-of-order message delivery.\r\nThis happened when a draining hash got unblocked by an ack while message replay filtering was in progress.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFix provided by @poorbarcode in comment https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23874#pullrequestreview-2567038955\r\n- track the hashes that have been blocked during the filtering of replay entries\r\n  - it is necessary to block all later messages after a hash gets blocked so that ordering is preserved\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n- Broker will limit the pending reading to Bookies if enabled `managedLedgerMaxReadsInFlightSize`\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17241 introduced a mechanism that merges BK reading requests if we can, for example:\r\n  - Request-1: Read entry `50~59` \r\n  - Request-2: Read entry `50~69`\r\n  - The `Request-2` will wait for `Request-1`, and only send a real request that reads `60~69` after `Request-1` is finished.\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\n- The `Request-2` above requests repeatedly\r\n  - It requests `50~70` when creating.\r\n  - It requests another range `61~70` after `Request-1` is finished.\r\n- Expected: `Request-2` acquire `20` quota.\r\n- Exact:  `Request-2` acquire `40` quota.\r\n- You can call `testPreciseLimitation` to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n- current problem is that unefficient IP address comparison will have to be performed on every match\r\n- equals method should check if the other object is the same instance as the first step\r\nPreviously the equals method performance has been improved by @Shawyeok in PR #18662. That addressed the main performance issue and this current PR is a small adjustment to avoid unnecessary work when there's a matching instance.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- add instance check as first step\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n- Retry topic relies on the delayed queue feature.

Motivation\r\n\r\n`org.apache.pulsar.client.api.RetryTopicTest#testRetryTopicWithMultiTopic` don't test the behavior of retry topic at all.\r\nInstead of calling `reconsumeLater` to trigger

#23848\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe Pulsar 4.0 Key_Shared PIP-379 implementation could deadlock and this problem was first captured in test environment heapdump where the thread stack information included in the heapdump showed multiple threads in blocked state, hinting a deadlock.\r\nWith the help of @pdolif, the problem was reproduced in isolation by simply adding this type of test code in a KeySharedSubscriptionTest test case.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// test code that triggered the deadlock issue\r\nnew Thread(() -> {\r\n    while(true) { pulsar.getBrokerService().updateRates(); }\r\n}).start();\r\n```\r\nIn the test case, this triggered a similar pattern of blocked threads and therefore could be considered a reproduction of the previously faced dead lock issue in a test environment.\r\n\r\nthreaddump with deadlock:\r\n* in jstack.review https://jstack.review/?https://gist.github.com/lhotari/75eebb84687333bd7b133f2cbf3b6af6#tda_1_dump\r\n* deadlock details: https://gist.github.com/lhotari/75eebb84687333bd7b133f2cbf3b6af6#file-deadlock-txt-L2244\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- add test case to reproduce the dead lock case which will prevent future regressions in the same area\r\n- fix the dead lock issue by replacing synchronization with read-write locks\r\n  - locks are for minimum \"scope\"\r\n  - callbacks are called outside of a lock scope to reduce the chances of potential other deadlocks\r\n- use volatile fields for counters in DrainingHashEntry so that entry methods can be used without separate locks\r\n\r\n###

when modifying `producer. pendingMessages`\r\n- move `fails all pending sends when producer.connection is null` to reconnect successfully, which was introduced by https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23761\r\n  - Remove the test that https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23761 added, which has been covered by the new test\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!--

#23389\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n- `pulsar1.getBrokerService().getTopic(topicName, false)`  may return a `completed empty future`, but the verify `assertTrue(future == null ||

Motivation\r\n\r\nge.apache.org is migrating to develocity.apache.org\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates the Pulsar project to publish Build Scans to the the new Develocity instance at develocity.apache.org.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR sets a projectId for use by Develocity.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen the log levels (`pulsar.log.level` and `pulsar.log.root.level`) are modified in the `conf/log4j2.yaml` during runtime, the change is not reflected in the logs as expected.\r\n\r\nI found the pulsar script always passes the `pulsar.log.level` and `pulsar.log.root.level`, which led to this issue.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Removed the error environment variable from the `pulsar/Dockerfile`.\r\n- A condition was added to include the `-Dpulsar.log.level` only if `PULSAR_LOG_LEVEL` is defined.\r\n- A condition was added to include the `-Dpulsar.log.root.level` only if `PULSAR_LOG_ROOT_LEVEL` is defined, and ensured `PULSAR_LOG_ROOT_LEVEL` fallback to `PULSAR_LOG_LEVEL` if not defined.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen using Pulsar with IPv6, it's necessary to set `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false` since Pulsar startup scripts set `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`. Currently it's not possible to override the Pulsar default by passing `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false` in `OPTS` environment variable. This PR intends to make it possible.\r\nThis PR is related to the issue #23843.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nPrepend the default value `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true` to `OPTS` instead of appending to it so that the setting in `OPTS` takes preference. The last setting in the argument line wins when setting system properties for Java processes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Issue: #23783\r\n\r\n### Motivation:\r\n\r\nThe `pulsar.log.level` property in`kubernetes_instance_log4j2.xml` & `java_instance_log4j2.xml` files in the Pulsar Functions runtime is responsible for configuring the log settings for function pods when using the Java runtime in Kubernetes StatefulSets & for process runtime respectively. Currently, this configuration file is hardcoded to use the `INFO` log level, which restricts flexibility when more granular logging (such as `DEBUG` level) is needed for troubleshooting or deeper monitoring. This limitation is particularly impactful when debugging issues related to sources, sinks, or function executions, where more detailed logs could be beneficial.\r\n\r\nPresently, adjusting the log level requires manual changes to the `kubernetes_instance_log4j2.xml` or `java_instance_log4j2.xml` file, which is inefficient and error-prone, especially in dynamic environments. There is no built-in way to modify the log level dynamically without altering the configuration file directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new argument (`logLevel`) to override the JVM property `-Dpulsar.log.level=info` at runtime for functions, sources, and sinks. This change provides a more flexible and dynamic approach to adjust log verbosity based on specific needs, such as enabling `DEBUG` or `ERROR` logs for better diagnostics during troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### Modifications:\r\n\r\n- **Introduction of `logLevel` Argument**: Added a new `logLevel` argument for Pulsar Functions, Sources, and Sinks, which allows the user to override the default JVM property `-Dpulsar.log.level=info`. This enables setting custom log levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `ERROR`) dynamically at runtime without modifying the `kubernetes_instance_log4j2.xml` or `java_instance_log4j2.xml` file.\r\n  \r\n- **JVM Property Override**: The new `logLevel` argument directly overrides the `-Dpulsar.log.level` property, giving users control over the logging level without needing to edit the underlying configuration file.\r\n\r\n- **Backward Compatibility**: The default log level remains `INFO` unless the new `logLevel` argument is provided. This ensures that existing deployments continue to function as before.\r\n\r\nThis update enhances the troubleshooting and monitoring capabilities of Pulsar Functions, offering greater flexibility while preserving the simplicity and stability of existing configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [X] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n*If `yes` was chosen, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API: no\r\n  - The schema: no\r\n  - The default values of configurations: no\r\n  - The wire protocol: no\r\n  - The rest endpoints: no\r\n  - The admin cli options: yes.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen using Pulsar admin version 2.10.x with JWT authentication and a broker running 3.0.x (forked from Apache Pulsar) configured with both Kerberos and JWT authentication providers,

authentication method name in the HTTP header(https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/14044 improves that), the broker iterates through each authentication provider to authenticate the request, if authentication data is valid, the broker acts on the request. In this scenario, I ensured that the JWT provider was configured correctly and the token was valid. However, I still encountered an authentication error.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the `org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.AuthenticationService#authenticateHttpRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.AuthenticationDataSource)` and `org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.AuthenticationService#authenticateHttpRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse)` only catches the `AuthenticationExecption`, if one provider throws an exception of a different type, the authentication process will be terminated.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23797, which fixes the pulsar chain authentication, not HTTP authentication.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Use `LinkedHashMap` instead of `HasMap` for provider ordering.\r\n- Catch type `Exception`, which can catch any exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nLet's say two clusters to two-way replication: cluster-1 and cluster-2\r\n\r\n- cluster-1: has enabled subscription replication and correctly configured the cluster info for `cluster-2` \r\n- cluster-2:has either incorrectly configured the information for `cluster-1` or disabled subscription replication.\r\n\r\nAs a result, `cluster-1` will send **SNAPSHOT_REQUEST** to `cluster-2` at a frequency of `replicatedSubscriptionsSnapshotFrequencyMillis` (1 second by default). \r\n\r\nIn extreme cases, this can lead to a large number of consecutive `marker` between `cluster-1` and `cluster-2` topic.\r\n\r\nThis may affect the performance of `reader` and `consumer`, or cause `reader.readNext()` to time out.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n- When there is no complete snapshot, retry according to replicatedSubscriptionsSnapshotTimeoutSeconds to minimize the number of markers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n- Add `testReplicatedSubscriptionOneWay` to cover this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n`MLPendingAckStoreTest#testMainProcess` will fail by NPE if batch index ACK is enabled. The NPE happens when the position argument does not has a non-null `ackSet`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Add an `ackBatchPosition` method to handle `Optional` objects correctly with elegant and clear code.\r\n- Replace `BitSetRecyclable` with `BitSet` as the value type of `batchDeletedIndexes` to simplify the unnecessarily complicated code of calling `recycle()`. For example, if `recycle()` is called in a callback of `ConcurrentSkipListMap#compute`, it could be called multiple times. Additionally, the optimization for GC is not provided because `BitSetRecyclable` cannot avoid the memory allocation of its underlying long arrays.\r\n- Mark `batchDeletedIndexes` as `@Nullable` and check if it's not null instead of `getConfig().isDeletionAtBatchIndexLevelEnabled()` to eliminate all NPE warnings.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nEnable batch index ACK in `MLPendingAckStoreTest` and guarantee this test passes.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current tear-down logic is listing ledgers and then deleting them. So, there's a race condition if some internal logic has deleted the schema ledger, which will cause the down process to fail.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Ignore deleted ledgers while tear-down.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes. -->\r\n- [ ]

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe `close` methods in client interceptors (`ProducerInterceptor#close`, `ConsumerInterceptor#close`, `ReaderInterceptor#close`) allow interceptor developers to release resources allocated in the interceptor when a producer, consumer, or reader is closed. \r\n\r\nHowever, these `close` methods were not invoked in the implementation of [PIP-23][pip-23].\r\n\r\n[pip-23]: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/2471\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Ensure the `close` methods of interceptors are called during the final stage of the closing process.\r\n- Add unit tests to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this Change\r\n\r\n- [x] Verified that the change passes all CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change includes the following tests:\r\n\r\n- Integration tests for `ProducerInterceptor` with non-partitioned and partitioned topics.\r\n- Integration tests for `ConsumerInterceptor` with non-partitioned and partitioned topics.\r\n- Integration tests for `ConsumerInterceptor` with ZeroQueueConsumerImpl\r\n- Integration tests for `ReaderInterceptor` with non-partitioned and partitioned topics.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/Shawyeok/pulsar/pull/23\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAfter opening this PR, the build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-09T07:51:38Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T08:35:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3125409143,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI1NDA5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-not-needed","name":"doc-not-needed","color":"e0e0e0","default":false,"description":"Your

Motivation\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a health check functionality for Kubernetes deployments, specifically adding a liveness probe for the function worker. The liveness probe is crucial for Kubernetes-based applications, enabling automated pod restarts in case of failure. This change ensures that the function worker recovers when a `ProducerFencedException` occurs, which causes the worker to get stuck and not recover.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when a client makes a request like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --location --request PUT 'https://localhost:6651/admin/v3/functions/test/test/test' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' --header '...' --form 'data=@functions-test-1.0.0.jar'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations, the following error is returned under heavy load:\r\n```json\r\n{\"reason\":\"Internal Error updating function at the leader\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, when the following error occurs in the function worker currently:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR org.apache.pulsar.functions.worker.FunctionMetaDataManager - Could not write into Function Metadata topic │\r\n│ org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$ProducerFencedException: Producer was fenced\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function worker does not recover, leading to an ongoing failure. With this update, the worker will automatically restart with the help of health check with liveliness probe upon encountering this error, ensuring proper recovery and continuity of operations.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThis update introduces an API endpoint to perform a liveliness check on the function worker pod. The API returns an HTTP status of `200 (OK)` when the `isLive` flag within `FunctionImpl` is true. If the flag is false, typically after a `ProducerFencedException` occurs, the API will return a status of `503 (Service Unavailable)`.\r\n\r\nThe Kubernetes deployment configuration has been updated to use this new API endpoint in the liveness probe along with existing `metrics` endpoint, allowing the system to monitor the health and availability of the function worker.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [X] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

#20635\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe client currently leaks producers when sending of the message fails and a new producer is created after an exception occurs. The previous producer wasn't closed in these cases.\r\nIn case of such failures, there should be a retry backoff so that such cases don't cause excessive load on the broker side.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- properly close retry topic and dead letter topic producers when they are discarded\r\n- add backoff for the creation of new producers when there are subsequent failures. Reset the backoff when a message is sent successfully.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Apache Pulsar Functions, as a distributed compute platform, relies heavily on asynchronous operations to process and transform data streams. However, the current implementation lacks a robust mechanism for accurately capturing and reporting the execution times of these asynchronous functions.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this Pull Request is to address the limitations of the existing asynchronous function execution time tracking system. By centralizing the start time recording and improving the consistency of execution time data, we aim to provide users with a more reliable and comprehensive view of function performance.\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nThis Pull Request introduces several modifications to the Apache Pulsar Functions project aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of asynchronous function execution time statistics. The primary goal is to enhance monitoring and analysis capabilities for function performance. Here’s a breakdown of the key changes:\r\n\r\n1. Removal of processTimeStart Method: The processTimeStart method in ComponentStatsManager has been removed. This method was previously used to record the start time of asynchronous function execution. The start time is now recorded in the JavaExecutionResult object, providing a more centralized and consistent approach.\r\n\r\n2. Modification of JavaInstanceRunnable: The run method in JavaInstanceRunnable has been updated to reflect the removal of processTimeStart. The stats.processTimeStart() call has been deleted, and the stats.processTimeEnd() method now accepts the start time as a parameter to calculate the total execution time.\r\n\r\n3. Update to FunctionStatsManager: The processTimeEnd method in FunctionStatsManager has been modified to remove the processTimeStart member variable and accept the start time as a parameter. This allows for accurate calculation of the function’s execution time.\r\n\r\n4. Changes to SinkStatsManager and SourceStatsManager: The processTimeEnd methods in SinkStatsManager and SourceStatsManager have been updated to accept the start time as a parameter. However, since these classes do not record processing time, the method bodies remain empty.\r\n\r\n5. Addition of startTime in JavaExecutionResult: The JavaExecutionResult class now includes a startTime member variable to store the start time of asynchronous function execution. This allows for accurate calculation of execution time within the handleResult method of JavaInstanceRunnable.\r\n\r\n6. Modification of AsyncFuncRequest: The AsyncFuncRequest class in JavaInstance now includes a result member variable of type JavaExecutionResult. This change ensures that the processAsyncResultsInInputOrder method uses the existing JavaExecutionResult object instead of creating a new one, maintaining consistency and avoiding duplication.\r\n\r\n7. Use of Same ExecutionResult in Non-asyncPreserveInputOrder Mode: In scenarios where asyncPreserveInputOrderForOutputMessages is disabled, the same executionResult object is now used to avoid unnecessary object creation and potential issues with result assignment.\r\n\r\n8. Fix for Result and Exception Handling: Two patches address potential bugs related to result and exception handling in JavaInstance. The processAsyncResultsInInputOrder method now ensures that the result and userException fields of JavaExecutionResult are properly set, improving the reliability of the execution result.\r\n\r\n9. Addition of Test Case: A new test case, testAsyncFunctionTime, has been added to verify the accuracy of asynchronous function execution time recording and calculation. This test ensures that the start time recorded in JavaExecutionResult is within an acceptable range of the actual start time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n`bookkeeper.conf` is missing parameters related to maximum compaction duration in apache/pulsar. These parameters are useful for managing bookkeeper compaction in heavy workloads.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\nAdded `majorCompactionMaxTimeMillis` and `minorCompactionMaxTimeMillis` to `conf/bookkeeper.conf` so that they can be updated from env variables in pulsar docker containers using `apply-config-from-env.py` script.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe subscription replication will be changed if the `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.ConsumerBuilder#replicateSubscriptionState` is `true`:\r\n\r\n1. New a consumer with `replicateSubscriptionState` is `false`, indicating that doesn't replicate this subscription.\r\n2. Close the first consumer, and new a consumer with `replicateSubscriptionState` is `true`, the subscription will be replication.\r\n\r\nBecause we already store this state with the cursor properties, the existing subscription should use the initial replication policy, this configuration should only affect new subscriptions. Otherwise, the cursor properties are meaningless.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- When new the `org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentSubscription`, which will call the `org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.persistent.PersistentSubscription#setReplicated`, so we can remove flip the subscription state logic.\r\n- Update `replicateSubscriptionState` javadoc.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#23809 \r\n### Modifications\r\nTo address these issues, the following changes have been made:\r\n1. **Dedicated Servlet Handler**: A new servlet handler has been added specifically for the `/status.html` endpoint. This handler directly checks the broker's readiness state.\r\n2. **Default `statusFilePath` Update**: The default value for `statusFilePath` in `standalone.conf` has been changed to an empty value. This prevents the use of an invalid default path.\r\n3. **Independence from `statusFilePath`**: The status endpoint has been modified to operate independently of the `statusFilePath` configuration. This means its functionality is no longer dependent on this setting.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` <!-- Your PR changes impact

Apache Pulsar Functions, as a distributed compute platform, relies heavily on asynchronous operations to process and transform data streams. However, the current implementation lacks a robust mechanism for accurately capturing and reporting the execution times of these asynchronous functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nThis Pull Request introduces several modifications to the Apache Pulsar Functions project aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of asynchronous function execution time statistics. The primary goal is to enhance monitoring and analysis capabilities for function performance. Here’s a breakdown of the key changes:\r\n\r\n1. Removal of processTimeStart Method: The processTimeStart method in ComponentStatsManager has been removed. This method was previously used to record the start time of asynchronous function execution. The start time is now recorded in the JavaExecutionResult object, providing a more centralized and consistent approach.\r\n\r\n2. Modification of JavaInstanceRunnable: The run method in JavaInstanceRunnable has been updated to reflect the removal of processTimeStart. The stats.processTimeStart() call has been deleted, and the stats.processTimeEnd() method now accepts the start time as a parameter to calculate the total execution time.\r\n\r\n3. Update to FunctionStatsManager: The processTimeEnd method in FunctionStatsManager has been modified to remove the processTimeStart member variable and accept the start time as a parameter. This allows for accurate calculation of the function’s execution time.\r\n\r\n4. Changes to SinkStatsManager and SourceStatsManager: The processTimeEnd methods in SinkStatsManager and SourceStatsManager have been updated to accept the start time as a parameter. However, since these classes do not record processing time, the method bodies remain empty.\r\n\r\n5. Addition of startTime in JavaExecutionResult: The JavaExecutionResult class now includes a startTime member variable to store the start time of asynchronous function execution. This allows for accurate calculation of execution time within the handleResult method of JavaInstanceRunnable.\r\n\r\n6. Modification of AsyncFuncRequest: The AsyncFuncRequest class in JavaInstance now includes a result member variable of type JavaExecutionResult. This change ensures that the processAsyncResultsInInputOrder method uses the existing JavaExecutionResult object instead of creating a new one, maintaining consistency and avoiding duplication.\r\n\r\n7. Use of Same ExecutionResult in Non-asyncPreserveInputOrder Mode: In scenarios where asyncPreserveInputOrderForOutputMessages is disabled, the same executionResult object is now used to avoid unnecessary object creation and potential issues with result assignment.\r\n\r\n8. Fix for Result and Exception Handling: Two patches address potential bugs related to result and exception handling in JavaInstance. The processAsyncResultsInInputOrder method now ensures that the result and userException fields of JavaExecutionResult are properly set, improving the reliability of the execution result.\r\n\r\n9. Addition of Test Case: A new test case, testAsyncFunctionTime, has been added to verify the accuracy of asynchronous function execution time recording and calculation. This test ensures that the start time recorded in JavaExecutionResult is within an acceptable range of the actual start time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n- There is an issue that leads to repeated consumption when replay reading and `cursor.rewind` execute concurrently.\r\n  \r\n**Information**\r\n- `read-position`: `3:21`\r\n- `mark-deleted-position: `3: -1`\r\n- `acked messages`: `3:1 ~ 3:20`\r\n\r\n| time | replay reading | `cursor.rewind` |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Start a replay reading after message redelivery(`3:0`) |\r\n| 2 | Replay reading is in-progress |\r\n| 3 | | `cursor.rewind`, which may be triggered by many cases |\r\n| 4 | | `cursor.readPosition` back to the first entry(`3:0`) |\r\n| 5 | read completely, send `3:0` to consumer | |\r\n| 6 |  | read completely, send `3:0 ~ 3:20` to consumer |\r\n\r\nIssue: the consumer received `[3:0, 3:0, 3:1, 3:2....3:20]. you can reproduce the issue by the new test `testMixedReplayReadingAndNormalReading(\"testRepeatedDelivery\")`\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Fix the issue\r\n- Add a test for the reverted PR, see more detail here:

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n- After all, consumers are off-line, the cursor will be triggered a `rewind`\r\n  - If there is a pending read is in-progress, the action `rewind` will be delayed after the pending read is complete. \r\n- The variable `dispatcher.recentlyJoinedConsumers` of `key_shared` mode guarantees delivery in order, it records the `cursor.readPosition` when consumers join.\r\n\r\n**Issue**: a case that makes items in `dispatcher.recentlyJoinedConsumers` out-of-order, the steps to reproduce the issue are as follows:\r\n- there are `3` consumers: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`\r\n  - `c1` and `c2` consumed all messages that they received.\r\n  - `c3` is stuck\r\n  - `LAC`: `3:299`, `cursor.readPosition`: `3:300`, `mard-deleted-position`: `3:100`\r\n- The dispatcher will replay the messages that were sent to `c3` after `c3` is removed.\r\n  -   At the moment, `c1` and `c2` are also off-line, which will trigger a `rewind`\r\n  - Since there is a pending read, the `rewind` will be delayed.\r\n- `consumer-4` joined, its `recentlyJoinedPosition` was set to `3:300`\r\n- The delayed `rewind` was triggered.\r\n  -  `LAC`: `3:299`, `cursor.readPosition`: `3:101`, `mard-deleted-position`: `3:100`\r\n- `consumer-5` joined, its `recentlyJoinedPosition` was set to `3:101`\r\n- The issue occured.\r\n\r\nyou can reproduce the issue by the new test `NonEntryCacheKeySharedSubscriptionV30Test`\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- After the delayed `rewind` was executed, clear the collection `dispatcher.recentlyJoinedConsumers`\r\n- The case described above may also lead a delivery being out if order issue, I pushed another PR to fix it\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/23803 \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen the pulsar-admin CLI uses the kerberos authentication with tls transport, we encounter the following issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bin/pulsar-admin tenants

org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$UnsupportedAuthenticationException: Method not implemented!\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Authentication` providers two methods to get the authentication data:\r\n\r\n- `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Authentication#getAuthData(java.lang.String)`\r\n   - For compatibility, which will call `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Authentication#getAuthData()`\r\n- `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Authentication#getAuthData()`\r\n\r\nHowever, the client/admin/broker/proxy still calls the `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Authentication#getAuthData()`, this breaks the kerberos authentication.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Use `org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationSasl#getAuthData(java.lang.String)` instead of `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Authentication#getAuthData()`.\r\n- Make `org.apache.pulsar.client.api.Authentication#getAuthData()` as deprecated.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen using Pulsar admin version 2.10.x with JWT authentication and a broker running 3.0.x (forked from Apache Pulsar) configured with both Kerberos and JWT authentication providers.\r\n\r\nWhen a request is without the authentication method name, the broker iterates through each authentication provider to authenticate the request, if authentication data is valid, the broker acts on the request. In this scenario, I ensured that the JWT provider was configured correctly and the token was valid. However, I still encountered an authentication error.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the `AuthenticationProviderList` only catches the `AuthenticationException` exception, If an authentication provider throws an exception of a different type, the authentication process will be terminated.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- `AuthenticationProviderList` catches the `Exception` exception, and then uses the `AuthenticationException` to wrap the original exception.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nVersion: `3.0.7`, thanks for @shibd investigating the issue together and mentioning the key clue that items are out of order.\r\n\r\n**Issue 1**: concurrentcy access a un-thread-safety collection\r\n- The variable `recentlyJoinedConsumers` of `PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers` is used to guarantee the delivery order of Key_Shared subscriptions, which is not a thread-safety collection.\r\n- Almost all operations that access this collection are in a lock block except in one place that the current PR fixes\r\n\r\n**Issue 2**: the items in `recentlyJoinedConsumers` are out of order\r\n- First node `104142:122103`\r\n- ...\r\n- middle node 1 `104142:122103`\r\n- middle node 2 `104046:283984`\r\n- ...\r\n- tail node `104046:284275`\r\n\r\nBut we have more than one place that relies on the order rule, such as follows\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/branch-3.0/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L377\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        if (readType == ReadType.Replay) {\r\n            // broker assumes the first node is the eldest one\r\n            PositionImpl minReadPositionForRecentJoinedConsumer = recentlyJoinedConsumers.values().iterator().next();\r\n            if (minReadPositionForRecentJoinedConsumer != null\r\n                    && minReadPositionForRecentJoinedConsumer.compareTo(maxReadPosition) < 0) {\r\n                maxReadPosition = minReadPositionForRecentJoinedConsumer;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/branch-3.0/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentStickyKeyDispatcherMultipleConsumers.java#L428\r\n\r\n```java\r\n            PositionImpl nextPositionOfTheMarkDeletePosition =\r\n                    ((ManagedLedgerImpl) cursor.getManagedLedger()).getNextValidPosition(mdp);\r\n            while (itr.hasNext()) {\r\n                Map.Entry<Consumer, PositionImpl> entry = itr.next();\r\n                if (entry.getValue().compareTo(nextPositionOfTheMarkDeletePosition) <= 0) {\r\n                    itr.remove();\r\n                    hasConsumerRemovedFromTheRecentJoinedConsumers = true;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    // break if one node does not match the check\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [topic-stats.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18280668/34-stats.txt)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n

or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMain Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\nWhen subscribing to topics using regex patterns, it’s possible to encounter scenarios where some topics process messages slower than others. This can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, as slower topics might block others. There’s a need to manage such situations dynamically to ensure efficient processing and fair resource allocation among topics.\r\n\r\nRelated discussions can be found in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApachePulsar/comments/1fssbbn/roundrobin_between_wildcard_topics/), which highlights issues similar to what we aim to address.\r\n\r\nWhen using `MultiTopicsConsumerImpl`, we can call this.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/5a3a1f169a7f90181bd5c213c8e9f479bc74f0f2/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/MultiTopicsConsumerImpl.java#L1246-L1258\r\n\r\nThere is a test case that explains how to unsubscribe from a single topic.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/5a3a1f169a7f90181bd5c213c8e9f479bc74f0f2/pulsar-broker/src/test/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/TopicsConsumerImplTest.java#L660-L663\r\n\r\n**This proposal seeks to integrate similar functionality into PatternMultiTopicsConsumerImpl, allowing dynamically remove or add specified topics.**\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n1. UnBlockTopics and BlockTopics Methods: In PatternMultiTopicsConsumerImpl, we introduce two methods: unBlockTopics and blockTopics.\r\n\r\n- BlockTopics: Unsubscribe from topics by invoking onTopicsRemoved from TopicsChangedListener.\r\n\r\n- UnBlockTopics: Resubscribe to topics by invoking onTopicsAdded from the same listener.\r\n\r\nThese changes will enable dynamic topic management, greatly improving the consumer’s ability to adapt to changing topic loads and enhancing overall system resilience against individual slow topics.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.
