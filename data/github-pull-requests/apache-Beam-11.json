now, we window outputs from bigquery write connector (representing failures) back into the global window, but we do this as part of the transform instead of in an explicit windowing step. This fails because when we do sampling, it expects the value to be in the window which was passed in. This behavior exists in other places and is supported in other SDKs, but doesn't work in python because we aren't able to encode the window correctly. This fixes the problem and allows the encoding to be a bit more permissive.\r\n\r\nWithout my change, this fails when performing sampling (example on [Dataflow](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/jobs/us-central1/2024-09-26_09_37_14-7677325219113638771;graphView=0?project=apache-beam-testing))\r\n\r\nAfter my change, this succeeds.

#32365\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for writing to dynamic Iceberg destinations, meaning that one transform instance can write to multiple Iceberg tables.\r\n\r\nIcebergIO is offered as a Managed transform, which makes it a portable transform. Instead of offering a function of some sort, users can specify a String template and we will substitute in the appropriate record field values to determine the destination (see [RowStringInterpolator](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/util/RowStringInterpolator.java) for more details and examples)\r\n\r\nFor more

sequence processing is used to ensure that events for a given key are only processed when it's guaranteed that they all the elements for this particular have been received. \r\n\r\nConsider a PCollection which contains these event tuples (first element of the tuple is the global sequence number): \r\n[1, key1, data], [2, key2, data], [3, key1, data], [4, key1, data], [5, key2, data], [7, key2, data]. Elements for key1 must be processed in the following order: 1, 3, 4. Elements for key2 must be processed in the following order: 2, 5. Event with sequence 7 can't be processed because there is a missing sequence 6.\r\n\r\nThe approach used to implement ordered processing in the presence of global sequencing:\r\n\r\n- Generate (periodically for streaming pipelines, once for batch) the side input which contains the maximum contiguous range of sequences across all keys and the maximum timestamp of events in that range.\r\n- Use this side input by the DoFns which process events to a) store in the per-key processing state the latest maximum range and b) set up an event time based timer to fire off at the latest timestamp. \r\n- Save all the events for a particular key into the ordered list state (with some optimization exceptions) because the events received in this DoFn are per key - they are not guaranteed to be contiguous and can't be processed right away.\r\n- Once the timer fires off there is a guarantee that all the events for a given key have been received up to the firing timestamp. The latest contiguous range stored in the processing state is used to limit the events in the ordered list state that can be safely processed in a loop.\r\n\r\nThis [high level diagram](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10D6zd2CR9cgZIY1lH838ia5s-t3-Yjg43wdYcerWN_U/edit#slide=id.g2f745ae1d7a_0_4857) illustrates the overall approach.\r\n\r\nThere are dedicated unit tests to cover both per-key and global sequence processing. Please refer to them to understand the details of use cases.\r\n\r\nNote that the batch unit tests for global processing don't automatically run under global sequencing. This is due to the apparent incorrectness of the DirectRunner implementation (it is supposed to block processing event processing DoFns until the side input is calculated once). The batch processing tests were successfully run manually using DataflowRunner. Additional work will be needed to either fix the DirectRunner, switch to PrismRunner (when it supports all the primitives used in this transform), or enable test to run a DataflowRunner.

the configuration of CDC writes into a BigQuery table by setting the primary key columns to be used in the row mutations.  This change adds the configuration of CDC usage for the `BigQueryStorageWriteApiSchemaTransformProvider`. \r\n\r\nBy setting `configuration.setUseCDCWritesWithPrimaryKey(List.of(\"col1\", \"col2\"))` on the provider's config, the transform creation will create a `BigQuery.Write<Row>` transform that will configure the right row mutation information by checking for a Row schema like: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  row_mutation_info:{\r\n    mutation_type: \"...\"              // can be UPSERT or DELETE\r\n    change_sequence_number: \"...\"     // used for custom insert ordering\r\n  }\r\n  record:{...}                        // actual data to be inserted\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation also enables the possibility of setting a dynamic destination alongside with CDC usage by using this Row schema: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  row_mutation_info:{\r\n    mutation_type: \"...\"              // can be UPSERT or DELETE\r\n    change_sequence_number: \"...\"     // used for custom insert ordering\r\n  }\r\n  destination: \"...\"                  // destination table for the data\r\n  record:{...}                        // actual data to be inserted\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Note:** In case of using dynamic destination and CDC is only supported when all the destination share the same primary key columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

splits too aggressively in low latency scenarios, which for textio can cause splitting to single byte inputs most of which don't output anything.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be nice to make this configurable, that is more plumbing than I'd like to do right now. Instead we add some per stage back off and catchup.\r\n\r\n* Give each stage an atomic progress interval value for its \"ticks\".\r\n* If no progress has been made in the interval (via no PCollections element count or channel index changes), split.\r\n* If we successfully split, back off the interval for all instances of the stage.\r\n   * This back off is clamped to a 30 second interval maximum.\r\n   * Back off is multiplicative (by a factor of 4).\r\n   * New bundles for this stage use that value.\r\n   * Reduces noisy per bundle log printouts by splitting less.\r\n* If bundles begin to complete without having any progress ticks, reduce the interval to catch up.\r\n   * This catch up is clamped to a minimum interval of 100 milliseconds.\r\n   * The catch up is additive (where we subtract the minimum interval from the current value).\r\n   * This allows us to get to a clear \"rate\" per stage, where it should settle on getting at least one progress tick.\r\n\r\nThe stages are all independant, so different stages will get different progress intervals over time. If bundles are always making progress, splitting behavior is unchanged (biased to not split).\r\n\r\nThis allows for larger latencies to first input, while not hampering separation harness tests, or otherwise overdoing it.\r\n\r\nThere still remains the same bad case, of time between elements being larger than 2* maximumProgressInterval, but to resolve that likely requires a bit more global state awareness, and not splitting when maximum parallelism has been reached. But that would be a different change.\r\n\r\nFixes #32498.\r\n\r\nTested against the Wordcount example with tightened minimal timings, and sleeps. Once this is in the following command should be able to validate that it's fixed the issue for the higher latency cases.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo run github.com/apache/beam/sdks/v2/go/examples/wordcount@master --input \"gs://apache-beam-samples/shakespeare/kinglear.txt\" --output counts\r\nhead -n 30 count\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change enables the configuration of CDC usage for the `BigQueryStorageWriteApiSchemaTransformProvider`. \r\n\r\nBy setting `configuration.setUseCDCWritesWithPrimaryKey(List.of(\"col1\", \"col2\"))` on the provider's config, the transform creation will create a `BigQuery.Write<Row>` transform that will configure the right row mutation information by checking for a Row schema like: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  cdc_info:{\r\n    mutation_type: \"...\"              // can be UPSERT or DELETE\r\n    change_sequence_number: \"...\"     // used for custom insert ordering\r\n  }\r\n  record:{...}                        // actual data to be inserted\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation also enables the possibility of setting a dynamic destination alongside with CDC usage by using this Row schema: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  cdc_info:{\r\n    mutation_type: \"...\"              // can be UPSERT or DELETE\r\n    change_sequence_number: \"...\"     // used for custom insert ordering\r\n  }\r\n  destination: \"...\"                  // destination table for the data\r\n  record:{...}                        // actual data to be inserted\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Note:** In case of using dynamic destination and CDC is only supported when all the destination share the same primary key columns.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR allows a user to create a custom expansion service JAR without needing to provide `jamm` manually as a dependency.\r\n\r\ne8cebdf4fe7e920b6494156aa3127037f23b58fe added a dependency on `\":sdks:java:harness\"` in the expansion service target which has a transitive dependency on a 'provided' `jamm`: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/33a0bfb5d374fae99b1f19405aba341a0716b1c0/sdks/java/harness/build.gradle#L40\r\n\r\nBy adding it as a `runtimeOnly` dependency in the expansion service target, a user can create a cross-language Java transform by simply importing the `beam-sdks-java-expansion-service` JAR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

BigQuery table schema utility and the implementation for StorageWrites for Beam Rows does not support sending rows with properties of type Map or array of Map as part of their schema.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds that functionality transforming the Map into a Message type which contains two fields, key and value, respecting the types coming from the Row schema while mimicking the behavior when using TableRows to the BigQueryIO PTransform.\r\n\r\nCopied from #22179 since it got closed after inactivity for long period (and I can not re-open it). \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for

Spanner Change Stream IO connector expects the beam framework to issue a split event either 5s or every 5MB of processed payload. In case that such event doesn't occur processing will continue until ultimately 1m pre-set timeout for Change Stream query is reached. This will cause the existing work to be dropped and query to be rescheduled.
