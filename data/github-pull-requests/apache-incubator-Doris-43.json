cache blocks could be downloaded as different types than the target type we intended to read, leading to false cache misses. E.g., a block might be downloaded as an 'idx' type when the current context expected a 'ttl' type.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this problem is the original design encoding meta info such as type and expiration time into cache block file path and readers of this cache block file have inconsistent view of the type so they use different name to locate file and run into error in the end.\r\n\r\nThis commit tries other type if the initial type failed to locate the file (return NOT_FOUND). Be ware that this is a nasty quick fix. We will elimite the metadate encoded in the file path in the near future to get rid of all the path related problems.\r\n\r\n### What problem does this PR solve?\r\n<!--\r\nYou need to clearly describe your PR in this part:\r\n\r\n1.

What problem does this PR solve?\r\nThe optimizer assumes column independence when estimating the number of rows filtered by predicates. When a predicate contains multiple AND conditions (especially, there are mutliple equal conditions), the estimated row count can be underestimated due to column correlation. Therefore, the following improvement is made: if multiple AND equal conditions appear in a predicate, the filter rate of the equal predicate is calculated using a gradient descent approach.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou need to clearly describe your PR in this part:\r\n\r\n1.

cache blocks could be downloaded as different types than the target type we intended to read, leading to false cache misses. E.g., a block might be downloaded as an 'idx' type when the current context expected a 'ttl' type.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this problem is the original design encoding meta info such as type and expiration time into cache block file path and readers of this cache block file have inconsistent view of the type so they use different name to locate file and run into NOT_FOUND error in the end.\r\n\r\nThis commit tries other type if the initial type failed to locate the file. Be ware that this is only a nasty quick fix. We will elimite the metadate encoded in the file path in the near future to get rid of all the path related problems.\r\n\r\n### What problem does this PR solve?\r\n<!--\r\nYou need to clearly describe your PR in this part:\r\n\r\n1.

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/55906\r\n\r\nDue to security restrictions, the GitHub Actions bot cannot trigger workflows directly. Instead, we use doris-robot to initiate other CI runs. Only automatically generated PRs will prompt doris-robot to comment, and we verify the author and content to determine whether a workflow should be triggered. This approach does not affect the original CI process; it simply adds an additional trigger condition.\r\n\r\n### Check List (For Committer)\r\n\r\n- Test <!-- At least one of them must be included. -->\r\n\r\n    - [ ] Regression test\r\n    - [ ] Unit Test\r\n    - [ ] Manual test (add detailed scripts or steps below)\r\n    - [x] No need to test or manual test.

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/55906 \r\n\r\nDue to security restrictions, the GitHub Actions bot cannot trigger workflows directly. Instead, we use doris-robot to initiate other CI runs. Only automatically generated PRs will prompt doris-robot to comment, and we verify the author and content to determine whether a workflow should be triggered. This approach does not affect the original CI process; it simply adds an additional trigger condition.\r\n\r\n### Check List (For Committer)\r\n\r\n- Test <!-- At least one of them must be included. -->\r\n\r\n    - [ ] Regression test\r\n    - [ ] Unit Test\r\n    - [ ] Manual test (add detailed scripts or steps below)\r\n    - [x] No need to test or manual test.

Body: ### What problem does this PR solve?\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n#### Issue 1\r\nThere are some fields that is missing in audit log table.\r\nThis PR add them all:\r\n- shuffle_send_rows\r\n- shuffle_send_bytes\r\n- scan_bytes_from_local_storage\r\n- scan_bytes_from_remote_storage\r\n- is_nereids\r\n- compute_group\r\n\r\nNotice that `compute_group` is previously name `cloudClusterName` in fe.audit.log,\r\nwhich is incorrect, so I change it to the right name.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, all these fields will be saved in both audit log table and fe.audit.log\r\n\r\n#### Issue 2\r\nThe `AuditEventBuilder` need to be reset at each run, the there will be duplicate audit log.\r\n\r\n#### Issue 3\r\nAdd a new statement `call flush_audit_log()`. It will flush the audit log immediately to audit_log table.\r\nThis is useful in test case, so that we don't need to wait 1min to flush the audit log data.\r\n\r\n### Check List (For Committer)\r\n\r\n- Test <!-- At least one of them must be included. -->\r\n\r\n    - [x] Regression test\r\n    - [ ] Unit Test\r\n    - [ ] Manual test (add detailed scripts or steps below)\r\n    - [ ] No need to test or manual test. Explain why:\r\n        - [ ] This is a refactor/code format and no logic has been changed.\r\n        - [ ] Previous test can cover this change.\r\n        - [ ] No colde files have been changed.\r\n        - [ ] Other reason <!-- Add your reason?  -->\r\n\r\n- Behavior changed:\r\n\r\n    - [ ] No.\r\n    - [x] Yes. `cloudClusterName` in fe.audit.log change to `computeGroup`. And some fields are added to the audit log table.\r\n\r\n- Does this need documentation?\r\n\r\n    - [ ] No.\r\n    - [x] Yes. I will add this later\r\n\r\n- Release note\r\n\r\n    <!-- bugfix, feat, behavior changed need a release note -->\r\n    <!-- Add one line release note for this PR. -->\r\n    [fix](auditlog) add
