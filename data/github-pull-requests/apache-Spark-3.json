What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport more SQL/DataFrame read path functionality in single-pass Analyzer:\r\n- Most of name resolution\r\n- Views\r\n- CTEs\r\n- UNIONs\r\n- Global aggregates\r\n- Most of the functions\r\n- LCAs in Project\r\n- LIMIT\r\n- Subtree resolution in extensions\r\n- Expression ID assignment\r\n- Generic type coercion\r\n\r\nAlso, remove `TracksResolvedNodes`, because it's based on comparing object addresses, which doesn't always make sense in Catalyst, because Catalyst reuses objects (e.g. literals or local/global limit expression trees).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo replace fixed-point Analyzer in Spark with a single-pass one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, single-pass Analyzer is still disabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- New test suites\r\n- Dual running two Analyzers and comparing logical plans with `ANALYZER_DUAL_RUN_LEGACY_AND_SINGLE_PASS_RESOLVER`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nYes, copilot.","created_at":"2025-01-24T19:53:39Z","updated_at":"2025-02-09T15:04:23Z","closed_at":"2025-02-04T20:59:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fc2aac3cef0af359fba122e1aee795a5b82c6ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5519550f81a2015a7c22c03fa024e0f5cd099878","head":{"label":"vladimirg-db:vladimirg-db/single-pass-analyzer/more-functionality","ref":"vladimirg-db/single-pass-analyzer/more-functionality","sha":"5519550f81a2015a7c22c03fa024e0f5cd099878","user":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":833519707,"node_id":"R_kgDOMa6AWw","name":"spark","full_name":"vladimirg-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Ensure that if relative path is used in `DataStreamWriter`, the path resolution is done on the Spark Driver and is not deferred to Spark Executor.\r\n2. Construct fully qualified path in `DataSource` similar to how it is done for `DataFrameWriter` before it is passed to `FileStreamSink`.\r\n3. Add a check to `FileStreamSink` that asserts that `path` is an absolute path.\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread/ffzwn1y2fgyjw0j09cv4np9z00wymxwv\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo properly support relative paths in structured streaming. The use case mostly applies to single node local Spark cluster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe change is only applicable to the use case when relative path is used in `DataStreamWriter`, resulting in data being output to correct directory. No changes are expected for absolute path (the most common production case).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test case to `FileStreamSinkSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-24T18:35:02Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T17:16:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f64df700091242601c94fc47870fcb3f99ea8ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49531\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two implementations of DownloadFileWritableChannel (which is used for writing data fetched to disk), SimpleDownloadWritableChannel and EncryptedDownloadWritableChannel. The latter closes the writable channel in its implementation of closeAndRead method while the former does not. As a result, SimpleDownloadWritableChannel channel is never closed and is relying on either the finalizer in FileOutputStream or the phantom cleanable in FileDescriptor to close the file descriptor. The change in this PR is to close the channel in SimpleDownloadWritableChannel closeAndRead method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nShould be closing file handles when they are not needed anymore instead of relying on finalizer/cleanables to do it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting spark tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-24T17:33:09Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T01:46:29Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T01:46:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dfa1b198a0b2f49388077bc1a9bd266bb197ee72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b230bf9ef674f893a67749c8df7794cf048bb7e","head":{"label":"ChenMichael:SPARK-50853-close-temp-shuffle-file-channel-3.5","ref":"SPARK-50853-close-temp-shuffle-file-channel-3.5","sha":"9b230bf9ef674f893a67749c8df7794cf048bb7e","user":{"login":"ChenMichael","id":9058607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTg2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9058607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael","html_url":"https://github.com/ChenMichael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":404433490,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDQ0MzM0OTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"ChenMichael/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ChenMichael","id":9058607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTg2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9058607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael","html_url":"https://github.com/ChenMichael","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChenMichael/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ChenMichael/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes the unused TableSchema(int numColumns) constructor, which was previously marked with a TODO comment for removal. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe constructor is no longer required and does not serve any functional purpose in the codebase. Eliminating this dead code enhances code maintainability and readability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisable the flaky TTL suite for TransformWithStateInPandas.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe suite is flaky on CI because for this test case, we want to test on scenarios of one key expires and the other key is still in the state store. The tricky thing is that we don't have equivalent of `StreamManualClock` in Scala and we have to manually set a Thread.sleep() time duration such that the TTL expires after a certain time duration while the other key does not. As the batch duration varies a lot on CI, this suite is flaky. We decided to disable the suite until we find a holistic fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested on CI.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMaking sure that having multiple parametrization nodes in the parsed logical plan is handled properly. Multiple parametrization nodes are made by doing a union of different dataframes over SparkConnect, and this feature was not supported previously, but [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49442) PR managed to support it, so testing for this feature was needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces normalization of expressions with random seed.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSingle-pass and fixed-point need to produce same plans after normalization, so we need to normalize non-deterministic expressions.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test case to `NormalizePlanSuite`.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `InvalidPlanInput` to Spark Connect Python client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the consistency with Spark Connect Scala client. We should capture the `SparkConnectGrpcException` more generally across all clients.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the user-facing error message would keep consistency with Spark Connect Scala client.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-23T06:50:15Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T06:50:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9389586ae7b3e73dbf891abc03d6cd9efc1c476e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28e020d435a4813d16aeffff40521b4558be3112","head":{"label":"itholic:invalid_input","ref":"invalid_input","sha":"28e020d435a4813d16aeffff40521b4558be3112","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake functions in org.apache.spark.sql.protobuf.utils.SchemaConverters private, especially toSqlType()\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRight now, protobuf.utils.SchemaConverters.toSqlType() is tagged as a public API, however, it cannot be accessed in public, as one argument is private. So direct calling this function will throw a ClassNotFound exception. This is confusing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the `variant_get` expression to support non-literal path inputs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, `variant_get` only supports literal paths as the second argument. Users may have columns containing paths which they would want to extract from variants. This PR allows this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, prior to this PR, `variant_get` did not have support for non-literal paths.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests to make sure that:\r\n1. The VariantGet/TryVariantGet expressions with non-literal paths has the expected behavior regardless of codegen mode.\r\n2. VariantGet expressions with non-literal paths do not get pushed down as this functionality has not been implemented.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds Java version checks and logic adaptations to `scenario6` in the test case named \"SPARK-35907: createDirectory\" within the `UtilsSuite`, ensuring that it can pass the tests both Java 17.0.13 and Java 17.0.14 as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJava 17.0.14 includes the fix for JDK-8294193: [`Files.createDirectories throws FileAlreadyExistsException for a symbolic link whose target is an existing directory`](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk17u-dev/pull/2870). This behaves differently from previous expectations in the targeted test scenario, which would cause the \"SPARK-35907: createDirectory\" test to fail.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d33f5c-d29a-4def-ba84-41475b231a63)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, since `setup-java` does not always install Java 17.0.14 (sometimes it installs 17.0.13 instead now), the current pr adapts the logic for versions after 17.0.14 and retains the original assertion behavior for versions 17.0.13 and earlier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

It leverages the extensibility of Spark Connect to create a server library \r\nthat may be attached to the server to extend the functionality of the Spark Connect server as a whole. Below is a detailed overview of the setup and functionality.\r\n\r\n## Project Structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── common/                # Shared protobuf/utilities/classes\r\n├── client/                # Sample client implementation \r\n│   ├── src/               # Source code for client functionality\r\n│   ├── pom.xml            # Maven configuration for the client\r\n├── server/                # Server-side plugin extension\r\n│   ├── src/               # Source code for server functionality\r\n│   ├── pom.xml            # Maven configuration for the server\r\n├── resources/             # Static resources\r\n├── pom.xml                # Parent Maven configuration\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Functionality Overview\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the extensibility of Spark Connect, a custom datasource handler, `CustomTable` is \r\nimplemented in the server module. The class handles reading, writing and processing data stored in\r\na custom format, here we simply use the `.custom` extension (which itself is a wrapper over `.csv`\r\nfiles).\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the client and the server must be able to communicate with each other through\r\ncustom messages that 'understand' our custom data format. This is achieved by defining custom\r\nprotobuf messages in the `common` module. The client and server modules both depend on the `common`\r\nmodule to access these messages.\r\n- `common/src/main/protobuf/base.proto`: Defines the base `CustomTable` which is simply represented\r\nby a path and a name.\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage CustomTable {\r\n  string path = 1;\r\n  string name = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- `common/src/main/protobuf/commands.proto`: Defines the custom commands that the client can send\r\nto the server. These commands are typically operations that the server can perform, such as cloning\r\nan existing custom table.\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage CustomCommand {\r\n  oneof command_type {\r\n    CreateTable create_table = 1;\r\n    CloneTable clone_table = 2;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- `common/src/main/protobuf/relations.proto`: Defines custom `relations`, which are a mechanism through which an optional input dataset is transformed into an\r\n  output dataset such as a Scan.\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage Scan {\r\n  CustomTable table = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the client side, the `CustomTable` class mimics the style of Spark's `Dataset` API, allowing the\r\nuser to perform and chain operations on a `CustomTable` object.\r\n\r\nOn the server side, a similar `CustomTable` class is implemented to handle the core functionality of\r\nreading, writing and processing data in the custom format. The plugins (`CustomCommandPlugin` and\r\n`CustomRelationPlugin`) are responsible for processing the custom protobuf messages sent from the client\r\n(those defined in the `common` module) and delegating the appropriate actions to the `CustomTable`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build and Run Instructions\r\n\r\n1. **Navigate to the sample project from `SPARK_HOME`**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd connect-examples/server-library-example\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Build and package the modules**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   mvn clean package\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. **Download the `4.0.0-preview2` release to use as the Spark Connect Server**:\r\n   - Choose a distribution from https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-4.0.0-preview2/.\r\n   - Example: `curl -L https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-4.0.0-preview2/spark-4.0.0-preview2-bin-hadoop3.tgz | tar xz`\r\n\r\n4. **Copy relevant JARs to the root of the unpacked Spark distribution**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n    cp \\\r\n    <SPARK_HOME>/connect-examples/server-library-example/resources/spark-daria_2.13-1.2.3.jar \\\r\n    <SPARK_HOME>/connect-examples/server-library-example/common/target/spark-server-library-example-common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\r\n    <SPARK_HOME>/connect-examples/server-library-example/server/target/spark-server-library-example-server-extension-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \\\r\n    .\r\n   ```\r\n5. **Start the Spark Connect Server with the relevant JARs**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n    bin/spark-connect-shell \\\r\n   --jars spark-server-library-example-server-extension,spark-server-library-example-common-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar,spark-daria_2.13-1.2.3.jar \\\r\n   --conf spark.connect.extensions.relation.classes=org.example.CustomRelationPlugin \\\r\n   --conf spark.connect.extensions.command.classes=org.example.CustomCommandPlugin\r\n   ```\r\n6. **In a different terminal, navigate back to the root of the sample project and start the client**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   java -cp client/target/spark-server-library-client-package-scala-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

a new PR for #49576 into a newly cut 4.0 branch.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroducing a new interface `DefaultStringProducingExpression` which should be inherited  by all expressions that produce default string type as their output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause right now all of these expressions have hardcoded default string type and it will be infinitely easier to manipulate these expression if they had a common supertype.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a refactoring change only, so existing tests should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr adds Java version checks and logic adaptations to `scenario6` in the test case named \"SPARK-35907: createDirectory\" within the `UtilsSuite`, ensuring that it can pass the tests both Java 17.0.13 and Java 17.0.14 as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJava 17.0.14 includes the fix for JDK-8294193: [`Files.createDirectories throws FileAlreadyExistsException for a symbolic link whose target is an existing directory`](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk17u-dev/pull/2870). This behaves differently from previous expectations in the targeted test scenario, which would cause the \"SPARK-35907: createDirectory\" test to fail.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21d33f5c-d29a-4def-ba84-41475b231a63)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, since `setup-java` does not always install Java 17.0.14 (sometimes it installs 17.0.13 instead now), the current pr adapts the logic for versions after 17.0.14 and retains the original assertion behavior for versions 17.0.13 and earlier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `getCondition` and deprecate `getErrorClass` in `PySparkException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo follow new naming convention proposed by SPARK-46810 and also match the behavior with JVM side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsing `getErrorClass` now issues the deprecate warning and encourages to use `getCondition`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing tests, so the existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip `test_take_adv` in Spark Connect only build. Similar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49565\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis particular test is flaky (https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/12835248061/job/35794283521 and fails with OOM, which results in stopping all following tests. We should at least fix this build, and run other tests.\r\n\r\nThe build reuses single JVM for running all tests so it consumes more memory.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill monitor the build.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-22T01:33:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T01:35:28Z","closed_at":"2025-01-22T01:34:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"243ac53493aa4123e5cda64a1f8faea09bc04941","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSetups `faulthandler` in `PythonPlannerRunner`s.\r\n\r\nIt can be enabled by the same config as UDFs.\r\n\r\n- SQL conf: `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.faulthandler.enabled`\r\n- It fallback to Spark conf: `spark.python.worker.faulthandler.enabled`\r\n- `False` by default\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `faulthandler` is not set up in `PythonPlannerRunner`s.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nWhen enabled, if Python worker crashes, it may generate thread-dump in the error message on the best-effort basis of Python process.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, if the top level data in createDataFrame is of type `VariantVal`, it succeeded and created a dataframe with nulls in each row. This PR causes `createDataFrame([<VariantVal>], \"v variant\")` to fail. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`createDataFrame([<VariantVal>], \"v variant\")` doesn't make sense. The data should be similar to `Iterable[Row]`. Since `VariantVal` is a relatively new data type and creating `VariantVal`'s before the [parseJson implementation](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49450) which is very recent was infeasible, this behavioral change should be acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users could run `createDataFrame([<VariantVal>], \"v variant\")` before (but only got a dataframe containing nulls) and they can no longer do that.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2025-01-21T22:40:10Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T01:33:03Z","closed_at":"2025-01-23T01:33:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c68c485787d0817826c873c1a708bfc6cf22656f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59c4a43d7fd1678fd3c3bb9d60ea41fbc41e804f","head":{"label":"harshmotw-db:harsh-motwani_data/variant_bug_fix_3","ref":"harsh-motwani_data/variant_bug_fix_3","sha":"59c4a43d7fd1678fd3c3bb9d60ea41fbc41e804f","user":{"login":"harshmotw-db","id":137231545,"node_id":"U_kgDOCC38uQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137231545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db","html_url":"https://github.com/harshmotw-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":667542123,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ8niaw","name":"spark","full_name":"harshmotw-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"harshmotw-db","id":137231545,"node_id":"U_kgDOCC38uQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137231545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db","html_url":"https://github.com/harshmotw-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harshmotw-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/harshmotw-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPreviously, we don't explicitly check when input of `to_avro` is `null` but the schema does not allow `null`. As a result, a NPE will be raised in this situation. This PR adds the check during serialization before writing to avro and raises user-facing error if above occurs. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt makes it easier for the user to understand and face the error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe session local plan cache may store unanalyzed logical plans, which causes them to be repeatedly analyzed, resulting in performance degradation.\r\n\r\nTo be specific, the session local plan cache usage pattern is,\r\n\r\n```\r\nval plan = planner.transformRelation(request.getPlan.getRoot, cachePlan = true)\r\nval dataframe = Dataset.ofRows(session, plan) \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere an unanalyzed plan may be cached during transformation, and Dataset.ofRows analyzes the unanalyzed plan. This leads to a situation where the same query may hit the cache, returning an unanalyzed plan, and Dataset.ofRows again analyzes the same plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroducing a new interface `DefaultStringProducingExpression` which should be inherited  by all expressions that produce default string type as their output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause right now all of these expressions have hardcoded default string type and it will be infinitely easier to manipulate these expression if they had a common supertype.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a refactoring change only, so existing tests should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, I propose upgrading the version of `PostgreSQL` driver version to `42.7.5`. More specifically, in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47810), the following regression was introduced:\r\n`Postgres` driver was not compatible for connection to the `Redshift` Data Source. This happened because the `42.7.4` driver version unnecessarily sent `SET extra_float_digits = 3` queries to the destination data source when establishing the connection. However, the upper limit for `extra_float_digits` parameter in `Redshift` is 2.\r\n\r\nRegarding the release notes of version [42.7.5](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/releases/tag/REL42.7.5), I propose to upgrade the version of the driver, because the behavior of sending queries which set `extra_flow_digits` when establishing connection was fixed in this version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis changes are essential when trying to properly connect to the Redshift instance from OSS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces UnionLoopExec, physical operator for recursion: UnionLoop is converted to UnionLoopExec during execution. \r\nFor now only UNION ALL case is supported.\r\nThe execution is performed by iteratively substituting UnionLoopRef with the plan obtained in previous step, as long as we are still generating new elements\r\n\r\nIn addition, small changes to `Optimizer.scala` are added to push down the Limit to UnionLoopExec in case it is present in the query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSupport for recursive CTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n1. Added golden files tests for various use cases of recursive CTEs: `cte-recursion.sql` and `with.sql` (tests are run with `SQLQueryTestSuite`). The outputs of the tests are checked with the outputs of the same (or syntactically slightly adapted) queries in Snowflake and PostgreSQL engines.\r\n2. Added two tests with parameterized identifier with recursive CTEs to `ParametersSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

Loop index `i` is defined as `int`, it's compared with `length`, which is a `long`, to determine if the loop should end.\r\n```\r\npublic static boolean arrayEquals(\r\n    Object leftBase, long leftOffset, Object rightBase, long rightOffset, final long length) {\r\n  ......\r\n  int i = 0;\r\n  while (i <= length - 8) {\r\n    if (Platform.getLong(leftBase, leftOffset + i) !=\r\n        Platform.getLong(rightBase, rightOffset + i)) {\r\n          return false;\r\n    }\r\n    i += 8;\r\n  }\r\n  ......\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, there's a code bug here. If `length` is greater than 2^31 + 8, this loop will never end because `i` as a 32 bit integer is at most 2^31 - 1. But compiler must consider this behaviour as intentional and generate code strictly match the logic. It prevents compiler from generating optimal code.\r\n\r\nDefining loop index `i` as `long` corrects this issue. Besides more accurate code logic, JIT is able to optimize this code much more aggressively. From microbenchmark, this trivial change improves performance significantly on both Arm and x86 platforms.\r\n\r\nBenchmark\r\n---------\r\nSource code:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/cyb70289/258e261f388e22f47e4d961431786d1a\r\n\r\nResult on Arm Neoverse N2:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                             Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nArrayEqualsBenchmark.arrayEqualsInt   avgt   10  674.313 ± 0.213  ns/op\r\nArrayEqualsBenchmark.arrayEqualsLong  avgt   10  313.563 ± 2.338  ns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult on Intel Cascake Lake:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                             Mode  Cnt     Score   Error  Units\r\nArrayEqualsBenchmark.arrayEqualsInt   avgt   10  1130.695 ± 0.168  ns/op\r\nArrayEqualsBenchmark.arrayEqualsLong  avgt   10   461.979 ± 0.097  ns/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeep dive\r\n---------\r\nDive deep to the machine code level, we can see why the big gap. Listed below are arm64 assembly generated by Openjdk-17 C2 compiler.\r\n\r\nFor `int i`, the machine code is similar to source code, no deep optimization. Safepoint polling is expensive in this short loop.\r\n```\r\n// jit c2 machine code snippet\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8904:   mov        w15, wzr              // int i = 0\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8908:   nop\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba890c:   nop\r\nloop:\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8910:   ldr        x10, [x13, w15, sxtw] // Platform.getLong(leftBase, leftOffset + i)\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8914:   ldr        x14, [x12, w15, sxtw] // Platform.getLong(rightBase, rightOffset + i)\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8918:   cmp        x10, x14\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba891c:   b.ne       0x0000ffff81ba899c    // return false if not equal\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8920:   ldr        x14, [x28, #848]      // x14 -> safepoint\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8924:   add        w15, w15, #0x8        // i += 8\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8928:   ldr        wzr, [x14]            // safepoint polling\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba892c:   sxtw       x10, w15              // extend i to long\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8930:   cmp        x10, x11\r\n  0x0000ffff81ba8934:   b.le       0x0000ffff81ba8910    // if (i <= length - 8) goto loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor `long i`, JIT is able to do much more aggressive optimization. E.g, below code snippet unrolls the loop by four.\r\n```\r\n// jit c2 machine code snippet\r\nunrolled_loop:\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6fe0:   sxtw       x10, w7\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6fe4:   add        x23, x22, x10\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6fe8:   add        x24, x21, x10\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6fec:   ldr        x13, [x23]          // unroll-1\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6ff0:   ldr        x14, [x24]\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6ff4:   cmp        x13, x14\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6ff8:   b.ne       0x0000ffff91de70a8\r\n  0x0000ffff91de6ffc:   ldr        x13, [x23, #8]      // unroll-2\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7000:   ldr        x14, [x24, #8]\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7004:   cmp        x13, x14\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7008:   b.ne       0x0000ffff91de70b4\r\n  0x0000ffff91de700c:   ldr        x13, [x23, #16]     // unroll-3\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7010:   ldr        x14, [x24, #16]\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7014:   cmp        x13, x14\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7018:   b.ne       0x0000ffff91de70a4\r\n  0x0000ffff91de701c:   ldr        x13, [x23, #24]     // unroll-4\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7020:   ldr        x14, [x24, #24]\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7024:   cmp        x13, x14\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7028:   b.ne       0x0000ffff91de70b0\r\n  0x0000ffff91de702c:   add        w7, w7, #0x20\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7030:   cmp        w7, w11\r\n  0x0000ffff91de7034:   b.lt       0x0000ffff91de6fe0\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

We should at least fix this build, and run other tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill monitor the build.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-20T00:44:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T01:18:52Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T00:49:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce88cb94eb6bd9b2db49ddc5c5705eddbf2dad83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to add a hint option for JDBC data source. This option is used to specify the hint for reading. It will apply only if the underlying DBMS supports the hint feature. Currently, this option is only supported by OracleDialect and MySQLDialect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's useful for performance tuning when reading from DBMS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPassed GA and add a new test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

`io.grpc.version`, so that when upgrading gRPC in the future, there will be no need to modify both `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala` simultaneously.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this PR moves the version

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe propose the following new syntax for altering multiple columns at the same time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN { \r\n  { column_identifier | field_name }\r\n  { COMMENT comment |\r\n  { FIRST | AFTER identifier } |\r\n  { SET | DROP } NOT NULL |\r\n  TYPE data_type |\r\n  SET DEFAULT clause |\r\n  DROP DEFAULT }\r\n} [, ...]  \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE test_table ALTER COLUMN\r\n  a COMMENT \"new comment\",\r\n  b TYPE BIGINT,\r\n  x.y.z FIRST\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis new syntax is backward compatible with the current syntax. To bound the complexity of the initial support of this syntax we place the following restrictions:\r\n\r\n+ Altering the same column multiple times is not allowed\r\n+ Altering a parent and a child column (for nested data type) is not allowed.\r\n+ Altering v1 tables with this new syntax is not allowed.\r\n\r\nIn terms of implementation, we modify the current `AlterColumn` logical plan to be `AlterColumns` that can take in multiple columns and `AlterColumnSpec`s. \r\n\r\nAll `AlterColumnSpec`s are checked during analyzing phase, so if one of them is invalid (e.g., non-existent column, wrong type conversion, etc), the entire command will fail.\r\n\r\nThe `AlterColumnSpec`s are transformed into `TableChange`s, which are passed to the `TableCatalog::alterTable` method. Therefore, the semantics of this new command (atomic vs non-atomic) depends on the implementation of this method.\r\n\r\nThe `V2SessionCatalog::alterTable` currently applies all table changes to the catalog table and then send to the catalog in one request. As a result, column changes are by default applied to the catalog (HMS) atomically: either all changes are made or none are.\r\n\r\nFor example, the above command produces the following plans:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAlterTable org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog@6d89c923, default.test_table, [org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.TableChange$UpdateColumnComment@ff58ec42, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.TableChange$UpdateColumnType@7e7c730c, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.TableChange$UpdateColumnPosition@bc842915]\r\n\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'AlterColumns [unresolvedfieldname(a), unresolvedfieldname(b), unresolvedfieldname(x, y, z)], [AlterColumnSpec(None,None,Some(new comment),None,None), AlterColumnSpec(Some(LongType),None,None,None,None), AlterColumnSpec(None,None,None,Some(unresolvedfieldposition(FIRST)),None)]\r\n+- 'UnresolvedTable [test_table], ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nAlterColumns [resolvedfieldname(StructField(a,IntegerType,true)), resolvedfieldname(StructField(b,IntegerType,true)), resolvedfieldname(x, y, StructField(z,IntegerType,true))], [AlterColumnSpec(None,None,Some(new comment),None,None), AlterColumnSpec(Some(LongType),None,None,None,None), AlterColumnSpec(None,None,None,Some(resolvedfieldposition(FIRST)),None)]\r\n+- ResolvedTable org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog@6d89c923, default.test_table, DeltaTableV2(...)),Some(default.test_table),None,Map()), [a#163, b#164, x#165]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAlterTable org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog@6d89c923, default.test_table, [org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.TableChange$UpdateColumnComment@ff58ec42, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.TableChange$UpdateColumnType@7e7c730c, org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog.TableChange$UpdateColumnPosition@bc842915]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN syntax allows altering only one column at a time. For a large table with many columns, a command must be run for each column, which can be slow due to the repeated preprocessing and I/O costs. A new syntax that enables specifying multiple columns could allow these costs to be shared across multiple column changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf
