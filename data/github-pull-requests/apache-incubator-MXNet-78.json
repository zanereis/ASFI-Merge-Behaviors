issue that \"no CUDA-capable device is detected\" occurs when calling MxNet from Java/Scala on a host without GPU. \r\n\r\nThe user scenario is to run MxNet model on CPU-only host with Context input as cpu(0). The default GPU unit shares the same index of zero with the default CPU unit. By default the MXNET_USE_CUDA is enabled and the logic will proceed to the line of \"CUDA_CALL\". The calling of cudaSetDevice exits with exception since there is GPU found for index of zero. The proposal here is to enable the \"CUDA_CALL\" only when the device type of Context is not CPU.\r\n\r\nThe whole project with code changes proposed here has been built successfully in local host. After that the running of MxNet model was successful in CPU-only host for evaluation.","created_at":"2017-09-11T22:43:49Z","updated_at":"2017-09-15T02:41:17Z","closed_at":"2017-09-15T02:41:10Z","merged_at":"2017-09-15T02:41:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"14cfb5a0c16cc7a23687f8b3e5890412d75b4136","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c0fcec99f6a07d6c10a29bd7e94ed8d4316f7658","head":{"label":"mg0880gm:mxnet-scala-cuda-fix","ref":"mxnet-scala-cuda-fix","sha":"c0fcec99f6a07d6c10a29bd7e94ed8d4316f7658","user":{"login":"mg0880gm","id":31866319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODY2MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31866319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm","html_url":"https://github.com/mg0880gm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103191219,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDMxOTEyMTk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mg0880gm/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mg0880gm","id":31866319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODY2MzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31866319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm","html_url":"https://github.com/mg0880gm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mg0880gm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mg0880gm/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

bit of profiling and research lead me to try the performance test suggested in #2739 for Perl.  The performance test code\r\n```perl\r\n#!/usr/bin/perl\r\nuse strict;\r\nuse warnings;\r\nuse AI::MXNet 'mx';\r\nuse Benchmark;\r\n\r\nmy $a = mx->random->normal(0, 1, [ 4, 1024, 1024

$size / $t->[0]);\r\n```\r\ngave me `GB/s: 0.851562` on master.  after looking into the code a bit, this patch brings the performance test to `GB/s: 8.35156` due to reduced buffer copying overhead.\r\n\r\n[this example](http://pdl.perl.org/?docs=API&title=PDL::API#Creating-a-piddle-manually-from-Perl) from the PDL docs uses the same pattern to load directly into the piddle without an intermediate buffer, so I think it's
