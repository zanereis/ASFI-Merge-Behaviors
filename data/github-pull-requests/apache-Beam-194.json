the moment the ReadFromText class return the content of the file losing the file source of the element. In some scenario, you have to implement transformation based on information recorded in the name of the file.\r\n\r\nI created an additional class: \"ReadFromTextWithFilename\" that return a tuple:\r\n\r\n(u'gs://bucket-namet/test1.csv', u'hello,hello') \r\n\r\ninstead of the just the element of the file. I tested the change, it works and continue to support all features supported by ReadFromText (coder, skip_header_lines, ...).\r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR extends the Avro <-> Beam conversion utilities. It adds conversions between the different schema types as well as from Beam Row to GenericRecord. In addition nullability support was extended to handle the case of nullable list and map element values.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not add support for SpecificRecord. SpecificRecord will be handled by extending our existing ByteBuddy codegen for Java Bean objects (as SpecificRecord is basically a Java Bean). \r\n\r\nNext steps will be to extend AvroIO (as well as other sources such as PubsubIO.readAvros) to register the correct schema on the output PCollection. Once this happens, all these PCollections will automatically work on any schema-aware transform.","created_at":"2018-12-02T06:33:03Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T20:46:02Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T20:46:02Z","merged_at":"2018-12-03T20:46:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b7cf422733a82aabb8e257e975d9e9c5e785376","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/7181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/7181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/7181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/aa4d9bc8a8f94b90a4ef4a6558c1d059a7a8f811","head":{"label":"reuvenlax:avro_schemas","ref":"avro_schemas","sha":"aa4d9bc8a8f94b90a4ef4a6558c1d059a7a8f811","user":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72963016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Mjk2MzAxNg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"reuvenlax/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

order to make dataflow runner harness take advantages of existed fnexecution classes and prepare for using ExecutableStage to process bundle, this PR is focusing on 3 simplifications:\r\n1. Change the MapTaskExecutor interface from using service to server, which will facilitate constructing JobFactory in PR: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/7015 .\r\n2. Deprecate the usage of ServerFactory in worker.fn and use fnexecution.ServerFactory instead.\r\n3.

change contains two things:\r\n\r\n- Move basic python Gradle tasks to BeamModulePlugin so that any Python sub-projects can reuse them for environment setup, build tar file, dependency install and cleanup.\r\n- Isolate virtualenv of different projects for parallel testing.\r\n- Create a sub-project beam-sdks-python-precommit-dataflow which defines basic Dataflow integration tests running in PreCommit. Those tests can run in parallel along with :beam-sdks-python:preCommit.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

wraps structuralDoFns in closures to avoid re-working the entire function analysis and binding stack. If we're going to generate code anyway, we may as well go all in.\r\nAmends the benchmarks to include the \"closurized\" variation, and re-works the variable names to be (I hope) clearer than the previous iteration.\r\n\r\nThis is about the end of improving performance of StruturalDoFns invocation. Using the generation tool, it's possible to invoke methods ~20x faster than the reflective default path.\r\n\r\nIt's probably possible to do better by generating truly *per function/per method* specializations, rather than balancing with binary size, and always jump from the interface{} args straight to the actual function call, but I think we'd want to have that as an option in the shimx or starcgen packages, rather than do it all the time. That would permit users to balance binary size against speed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

provides an equivalent superclass for SimpleFunction.\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6150\r\n\r\nThe intention here is to be both binary and recompile compatible with code using previous version of the Beam Java SDK, so some careful review is needed to ensure that's the case. See the Java specification's chapter on [binary compatibility](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-13.html).\r\n\r\nWe originally discussed deprecating SerializableFunction and SimpleFunction in favor of the new classes, but there appear to be two fairly separate use cases for SerializableFunction. It's either defining user code that will be executed in a DoFn, in which case I think we always want to prefer the new interface that allows declared exceptions. But it's also used where the code is to be executed as part of pipeline construction, in which case it may be reasonable to want to restrict checked exceptions. In any case, deprecating SerializableFunction and SimpleFunction can be discussed further in the future.\r\n\r\nI've attempted to provide significant context in the docstrings to explain the differences between these various classes and interfaces, and to explain the naming. The new interface and class are now used in `MapElements`, `FlatMapElements` and `Filter` as part of this PR. There are many other places in the SDK where we could alter methods to accept these less restrictive types, but those can be altered as needed in future changes.\r\n\r\nI'm very open to feedback about suggestions for alternate names for the new `ProcessFunction` and `InferableFunction`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

@aaltay,\r\n\r\nThe `python_io` module being used here is going away in tensorflow2\r\n\r\nNew versions of tensorflow will ship with a `compat.v1` module that still contains these deprecated APIs.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to future-proof this code, and keep it running with the older tensorflow releases is to `import tf.compat.va as tf` if it exists.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X -no jira issue ] Format the pull request title like

change contains two things:\r\n\r\n- Move basic python Gradle tasks to `BeamModulePlugin` so that any Python sub-projects can reuse them for environment setup, build tar file, dependency install and cleanup.\r\n- Create a sub-project `beam-sdks-python-precommit-dataflow` which defines basic Dataflow integration tests running in PreCommit. Those tests can run in parallel along with `:beam-sdks-python:preCommit`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

change:\r\n* Parameterizes the shadow jar validation to allow for excludes to be on a per project basis instead.\r\n* Cuts down the Dataflow worker jar by ~20mbs of non-relocated classes that are provided by the SDK during job submission.\r\n* Fixes building the job management and fn execution model jars which were including the model pipeline classes.\r\n* Adds several comments on how one is meant to shade the legacy worker jar correctly and enforces validation so classes don't leak out unexpectedly.\r\n* Adds two follow-up TODOs to relocate DataflowRunnerHarness which requires fixing boot.go code and also relocating conscrypt.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull

we support only ScalarFunction UDFs. In Calcite, there are other kinds of UDFs. With TableMacro UDFs users can connect external data sources in a similar way as in TableProvider, but without specifying a schema, or enumerating a list of existing tables in advance.\r\n\r\nAn example use case is connecting external metadata service and querying range of partitions.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table(my_udf('dataset', start = '2017-01-01', end = '2018-01-01'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the implementation of `my_udf` will connect to this service, get file locations for a range of partitions, and translate to PTransform reading it.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

test is hitting a timeout at 30 seconds. I am unclear as to whether it is a failure or something is very slow. It seems to have platform differences, terminating very quickly on OSX and failing in this way on Linux.

This is blocking precommits so it is quite urgent.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

to set max parallelism to FlinkRunner and leverage it for UnboundedSourceWrapper to produce finer grained state which will allow to re-scale job up to max-parallelism. \r\nIf max parallelism is not set, system behaves like before this PR and splits according to parallelism.\r\n\r\n@mxm pointed out that there is `BoundedToUnboundedSourceAdapter` which can lead to unnecessary splitting e.g. for files. Therefore, in `FlinkStreamingTransformTranslators`, max parallelism is used only for `UnboundedReadSourceTranslator` and not for `BoundedReadSourceTranslator` which uses this adapter. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

an implementation detail of some SQL (equi-)joins, we perform a CoGBK. The element timestamps from this are not super important, since the next GROUP BY will have windowing that explicitly says which column to treat as a timestamp. In other words, there is no need for a \"timestamp combiner\" to decide what the output timestamp is since it is explicit. But we do need the watermark to be held in an appropriate way. If we let it jump to the end of the window and that happens to be the global window, then any downstream windowing will be immediately droppable.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.
