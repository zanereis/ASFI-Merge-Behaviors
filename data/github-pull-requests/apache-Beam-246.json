This is acceptable for performance-sensitive locations if it is known that performance is improved.\r\n\r\nThe Runner API uses strings for identifiers, which is consistent with proto best practices for extensibility and usability. And in the Runner API these two factors trump performance, since it has negligibly low throughput requirements.\r\n\r\nSince the Fn API must transition to `FunctionSpec` and `Coder` from the Runner API (largely the same, but more fleshed out) and we desire to also share `GraphNode`, I have done the brain-dead automated thing to convert the identifiers to strings.\r\n\r\nIn the Runner API many of these identifiers disappear anyhow, but conflating the unification of the APIs with this conversion got a bit out of hand, so I'd like to do this first.\r\n\r\nI would like feedback from those more familiar with the harness about where this is known to be a performance bottleneck.","created_at":"2017-02-13T06:32:34Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T23:57:07Z","closed_at":"2017-02-24T02:47:22Z","merged_at":"2017-02-24T02:47:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"9933f27140ddfe5b9ded4a0688a9c0506ef94113","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9933f27140ddfe5b9ded4a0688a9c0506ef94113","head":{"label":"kennknowles:fn-api-string-ids","ref":"fn-api-string-ids","sha":"9933f27140ddfe5b9ded4a0688a9c0506ef94113","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror
