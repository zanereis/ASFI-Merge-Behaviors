What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPython UDFs in Spark SQL are run in a separate Python process. The Python process is fed input by a dedicated thread (`BasePythonRunner.WriterThread`). This writer thread drives the child plan by pulling rows from its output iterator and serializing them across a socket.\r\n\r\nWhen the child exec node is the off-heap vectorized Parquet reader, these rows are backed by off-heap memory. The child node uses a task completion listener to free the off-heap memory at the end of the task, which invalidates the output iterator and any rows it has produced. Since task completion listeners are registered bottom-up and executed in reverse order of registration, this is safe as long as an exec node never accesses its input after its task completion listener has executed.[^1]\r\n\r\nThe BasePythonRunner task completion listener violates this assumption. It interrupts the writer thread, but does not wait for it to exit. This causes a race condition that can lead to an executor crash:\r\n1. The Python writer thread is processing a row backed by off-heap memory.\r\n2. The task finishes, for example because it has reached a row limit.\r\n3. The BasePythonRunner task completion listener sets the interrupt status of the writer thread, but the writer thread does not check it immediately.\r\n4. The child plan's task completion listener frees its off-heap memory, invalidating the row that the Python writer thread is processing.\r\n5. The Python writer thread attempts to access the invalidated row. The use-after-free triggers a segfault that crashes the executor.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by making the BasePythonRunner task completion listener wait for the writer thread to exit before returning. This prevents its input from being invalidated while the thread is running. The sequence of events is now as follows:\r\n1. The Python writer thread is processing a row backed by off-heap memory.\r\n2. The task finishes, for example because it has reached a row limit.\r\n3. The BasePythonRunner task completion listener sets the interrupt status of the writer thread and waits for the writer thread to exit.\r\n4. The child plan's task completion listener can safely free its off-heap memory without invalidating live rows.\r\n\r\nTaskContextImpl previously held a lock while invoking the task completion listeners. This would now cause a deadlock because the writer thread's exception handler calls `TaskContextImpl#isCompleted()`, which needs to acquire the same lock. To avoid deadlock, this PR modifies TaskContextImpl to release the lock before invoking the listeners, while still maintaining sequential execution of listeners.\r\n\r\n[^1]: This guarantee was not historically recognized, leading to similar bugs as far back as 2014 ([SPARK-1019](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1019?focusedCommentId=13953661&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-13953661)). The root cause was the lack of a reliably-ordered mechanism for operators to free resources at the end of a task. Such a mechanism (task completion listeners) was added and gradually refined, and we can now make this guarantee explicit. (An alternative approach is to use closeable iterators everywhere, but this would be a major change.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, attempting to use Python UDFs while the off-heap vectorized Parquet reader is enabled (`spark.sql.columnVector.offheap.enabled true`) can cause executors to segfault.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA [previous PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30177) reduced the likelihood of encountering this race condition, but did not eliminate it. The accompanying tests were therefore flaky and had to be disabled. This PR eliminates the race condition, allowing us to re-enable these tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently we collect hive client calls metrics from `withHiveState`, it's not correct that in one call `withHiveState`, there may be many hive client calls. we need to split such behaviors.\r\n\r\nIn this pr we add a parameter to API `withHiveState` to collect the correct hive client calls when call `withHiveState` and and add some direct metrics  collect method in some uncertain calls `HiveCatalogMetrics.incrementHiveClientCalls`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake hive client calls metrics more accrate\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `date_format` function with `B` format has different behavior when use Java 8 and Java 17, `select date_format('2018-11-17 13:33:33.333', 'B')` in `datetime-formatting-invalid.sql` can prove this.\r\n\r\nThe case result with Java 8 is\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- !query\r\nselect date_format('2018-11-17 13:33:33.333', 'B')\r\n-- !query schema\r\nstruct<>\r\n-- !query output\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException\r\nUnknown pattern letter: B\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the case result with Java 17 is\r\n\r\n```\r\n- datetime-formatting-invalid.sql *** FAILED ***\r\n  datetime-formatting-invalid.sql\r\n  Expected \"struct<[]>\", but got \"struct<[date_format(2018-11-17 13:33:33.333, B):string]>\" Schema did not match for query #34\r\n  select date_format('2018-11-17 13:33:33.333', 'B'): -- !query\r\n  select date_format('2018-11-17 13:33:33.333', 'B')\r\n  -- !query schema\r\n  struct<date_format(2018-11-17 13:33:33.333, B):string>\r\n  -- !query output\r\n  in the afternoon (SQLQueryTestSuite.scala:469)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe found that this is due to the new support of format `B` in Java 17\r\n\r\n```\r\n'B' is used to represent Pattern letters to output a day period in Java 17\r\n\r\n     *  Pattern  Count  Equivalent builder methods\r\n     *  -------  -----  --------------------------\r\n     *    B       1      appendDayPeriodText(TextStyle.SHORT)\r\n     *    BBBB    4      appendDayPeriodText(TextStyle.FULL)\r\n     *    BBBBB   5      appendDayPeriodText(TextStyle.NARROW)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd through [ http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datetime-pattern.html]( http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datetime-pattern.html) , we can confirm that format `B` is not documented/supported for `date_format` function currently. \r\n\r\nSo the main change of this pr is manual disabled format `B` of `date_format` function in `DateTimeFormatterHelper` to make Java 17 compatible with Java 8.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure that Java 17 and Java 8 have the same behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Manual test `SQLQueryTestSuite` with JDK 17\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA shuffle block is considered as skewed and will be accurately recorded in HighlyCompressedMapStatus if its size if larger than this factor multiplying  the median shuffle block size.\r\n\r\nBefore this change \r\n\r\n![map_status_before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626747/137251903-08a3544c-dc77-4b78-8ae5-93b42a54bd03.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this

report accurate shuffle block size if the block size is greater than \"spark.shuffle.accurateBlockThreshold\"( 100M by default ). But if there are a large number of map tasks and the shuffle block sizes of these tasks are smaller than \"spark.shuffle.accurateBlockThreshold\", there may be unrecognized data skew.\r\n\r\nFor example, there are 10000 map task and 10000 reduce task, and each map task create 50M shuffle blocks for reduce 0, and 10K shuffle blocks for the left reduce tasks, reduce 0 is data skew, but the stat of this plan do not have this information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdate exists

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExtending the python test runner by logging out the temp output files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI was running a python test which was extremely slow and I was surprised the unit-tests.log has not been even created. Looked into the code and as I got the tests can be executed in parallel and each one has its own temporary output file which is only added to the unit-tests.log when a test is finished with a failure (after acquiring a lock to avoid parallel write on unit-tests.log).\r\n\r\nTo avoid such a confusion it would make sense to log out the path of those temporary output files this way when a test got stuck we can peek into its log file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI was running the python tests:\r\n```\r\n./python/run-tests\r\nRunning PySpark tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nsince SPARK-13704, spark re-implemented RackResolver and created a separate dnsToSwitchMapping instance. Here change to use RackResolver's internal dnsToSwitchMapping to reduce the time taken by YarnAllocator to add container requests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf submits a stage with abundant tasks, rack resolving takes a long time when YarnAllocator add requests with locality preference, which is caused by a large number of loops to execute the rack parsing script, eventually causing ExecutorAllocationManager request total Executors rpc  timeout.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT +  manually testing on a 5w+ node cluster.","created_at":"2021-10-09T07:41:22Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T10:07:19Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T00:15:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06da5dcbe9aae99d57de1db461ceb373873433ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f16f2608195838310c0202fcbc0d15d4ac9269c5","head":{"label":"gaoyajun02:SPARK-36964","ref":"SPARK-36964","sha":"f16f2608195838310c0202fcbc0d15d4ac9269c5","user":{"login":"gaoyajun02","id":81629032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjI5MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81629032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02","html_url":"https://github.com/gaoyajun02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358891084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg4OTEwODQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaoyajun02/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaoyajun02","id":81629032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjI5MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81629032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02","html_url":"https://github.com/gaoyajun02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaoyajun02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaoyajun02/spark","description":"Apache

So it's great to be able to push down filters with ANSI interval values for the better performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInline type hints for python/pyspark/resource/information.py and python/pyspark/resource/profile.py\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFast fail when [Dataset.withWatermark](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.0-rc7/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L740) is triggered on non-streaming Dataset.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow it can be triggered on non-streaming dataset, and there is a specific rule to eliminate in analyze phase. User can call this API and nothing happens, it may be a little bit confused.\r\nIf the usage is not as expected, we can just fast fail it with explicit message, and then we do not have to keep an extra specific rule for it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to leverage the error message framework by exposing the methods below:\r\n\r\n- `getErrorClass`\r\n- `getSqlState`\r\n\r\nat captured PySpark SQL exceptions (from `SparkThrowable`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR adds a bit of refactoring. Previously the exception capture was done by string comparison which is flaky. Now, the logic leverages `isInstanceOf` on JVM.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsers can leverage the error class and SQL state codes by:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    ...\r\nexcept AnalysisException as e:\r\n    if e.getSqlState().startswith(\"4\"):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users now can get `getErrorClass` and `getSqlState` from SQL exceptions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unittests were added.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-08T04:14:22Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:22Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T04:28:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff4270b12ab9e709dd444980f5af939ab2364759","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e98de727b7fc095d102ae53524d1c8f021acf3bd","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36953","ref":"SPARK-36953","sha":"e98de727b7fc095d102ae53524d1c8f021acf3bd","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current `HiveexternalCatalog.listpartitions`, it use \r\n```\r\n  final def getPartitions(\r\n      db: String,\r\n      table: String,\r\n      partialSpec: Option[TablePartitionSpec]): Seq[CatalogTablePartition] = {\r\n    getPartitions(getTable(db, table), partialSpec)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIt call `geTables` to get a raw HiveTable then convert it to a CatalogTable, in `getPartitions` it re-convert it to a HiveTable.\r\nThis cause a conflicts since in HiveTable we store schema as lowercase but for bucket cols and sort cols it didn't convert it to lowercase. \r\n\r\nIn this pr, we directly pass raw HiveTable to HiveClient's request to avoid unnecessary convert and potential conflicts, also  respect case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen user create a hive bucket table with upper case schema, the table schema will be stored as lower cases while bucket column info will stay the same with user input.\r\n\r\nif we try to insert into this table, an HiveException reports bucket column is not in table schema.\r\n\r\nhere is a simple repro\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n  CREATE TABLE TEST1(\r\n    V1 BIGINT,\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34091 to set the Hadoop 2 daily job properly.\r\nThe previous PR mistakenly did not set the schedule so the daily jobs are not being triggered - looks like I forgot to sync the PR with the testing base in my fork.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to run the daily job with Hadoop 2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt will be tested once it's merged. It won't break any build in any event.","created_at":"2021-10-08T00:37:07Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:24Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T00:41:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06042316758887412acabc0e8311ea0f1189cb18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7fea4c230473011c2d0f4c59b2014db73064765f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36839-followup","ref":"SPARK-36839-followup","sha":"7fea4c230473011c2d0f4c59b2014db73064765f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a minor fix to the usage of `GzipCodec` in `WholeTextFileRecordReaderSuite` by setting `Configuration` on it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs `Configurable` class, `GzipCodec` should be set with `Configuration` before using as an initialization. It has a `conf` member variable and many methods use it to access hadoop configurations. This is how it is used in Hadoop codebase.\r\n\r\nWe added an internal Hadoop configuration recently and found `WholeTextFileRecordReaderSuite` failed due to this issue in the test suite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports the change of SPARK-36874 (#34172) mainly, and SPARK-34634 (#31752) partially to care about the ambiguous self join for `ScriptTransformation`.\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that ambiguous self join can't be detected if the left and right DataFrame are swapped.\r\nThis is an example.\r\n```\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, 2, \"A1\"),(2, 1, \"A2\")).toDF(\"key1\", \"key2\", \"value\")\r\nval df2 = df1.filter($\"value\" === \"A2\")\r\n\r\ndf1.join(df2, df1(\"key1\") === df2(\"key2\")) // Ambiguous self join is detected and AnalysisException is thrown.\r\n\r\ndf2.join(df1, df1(\"key1\") === df2(\"key2)) // Ambiguous self join is not detected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems that an inner function `collectConflictPlans` in `ResolveReference.dedupRight.` doesn't copy the `dataset_id` tag when it copies a `LogicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2021-10-07T03:39:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T10:00:13Z","closed_at":"2021-10-07T06:57:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17a0cff526a4559416eea1193988334da400d403","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34205/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34205/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34205/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/352934b3e227e64a7e4a2a1140394dac7c58a0b2","head":{"label":"sarutak:backport-SPARK-36874","ref":"backport-SPARK-36874","sha":"352934b3e227e64a7e4a2a1140394dac7c58a0b2","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new test which checks saving/loading of ANSI intervals as columns of a dataframe to/from a table using Hive External catalog and the Parquet datasource.\r\n\r\nSince Hive Metastore/Serde doesn't support interval types natively, Spark fallbacks to Spark specific format for schema w/ ANSI intervals. And it outputs the warning:\r\n```\r\n23:35:46.289 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.hive.test.TestHiveExternalCatalog: Could not persist `default`.`tbl_ansi_intervals` in a Hive compatible way. Persisting it into Hive metastore in Spark SQL specific format.\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error: type expected at the position 0 of 'interval year to month:interval day to second' but 'interval year to month' is found.\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.createTable(Hive.java:869)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt -Phive-2.3

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInline type hints for python/pyspark/sql/avro/functions.py.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, we use stub files for type annotations, which don't support type checks within function bodies. So we propose to inline the type hints to support that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following:\r\n1. adds a new class `ParquetColumn`, which is a wrapper on a Spark `DataType` with additional Parquet column information, including its max repetition level & definition level, path from the root schema, column descriptor if the node is a leaf, the children nodes is it is a non-leaf, etc. This is needed to support complex type in the vectorized path, where we need to assemble a column vector of complex type using these information.\r\n2. extends `ParquetSchemaConverter` to convert from a Parquet `MessageType` to a `ParquetColumn`, mostly by piggy-backing on the existing logic. A new method `converParquetColumn` is added for this purpose, and the existing `convert` is changed to simply by calling the former.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn order to support complex type for the vectorized Parquet reader (see SPARK-34863 for more info), we'll need to capture Parquet specific information such as max repetition/definition level for Spark's `DataType`, so that we can assemble primitive column vectors into ones with complex type (e.g., struct, map, array).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExtended the test cases in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInline type hints for python/pyspark/sql/group.py from Inline type hints for python/pyspark/sql/group.pyi.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files python/pyspark/sql/group.pyi to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a minor followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33992 to fix the warnings during PySpark documentation build:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/functions.py:docstring of pyspark.sql.functions.bit_length:19: WARNING: Unexpected section title or

transition.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should always have the same length of hyphens with the title.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo remove warnings during the documentation build and show the HTML pages correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is not released yet, and only in master branch. So, no to end users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built the docs via `make clean html` at `python/docs`

Therefore, this PR proposes to catch all exceptions when reading image to properly handle malformed images.\r\n\r\nFor the reason why it's flaky instead of consistently failing, I am not yet sure. However, the fix should be correct.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix the flaky tests, see https://github.com/apache/spark/runs/3802639160 as an example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers would be able to read malformed data even for the cases of `javax.imageio.IIOException` (or other unexpected non-runtime exceptions) is thrown when `dropInvalid`  option is enabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unittests. We should track if the tests are still flaky or not.","created_at":"2021-10-06T00:38:43Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:25Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T00:04:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdb9108d97e42e37818747af04bde86d29510b7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/19d717c01a318d3177d5c22221e867409c6474f7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-29871","ref":"SPARK-29871","sha":"19d717c01a318d3177d5c22221e867409c6474f7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Factor out a method `trySpillAndAcquire()` from `acquireExecutionMemory()` that handles the details of how to spill a `MemoryConsumer` and acquire the spilled memory. This logic was duplicated twice.\r\n* Combine the two loops (spill other consumers and self-spill) into a single loop that implements equivalent logic. I made self-spill the lowest priority consumer and this is exactly equivalent.\r\n* Consolidate comments a little to explain what the policy is trying to achieve and how at a high level\r\n* Add a couple more debug log messages to make it easier to follow\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce code duplication and better separate the policy decision of which MemoryConsumer to spill from the mechanism of requesting it to spill.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded some unit tests to verify the details of the spilling decisions in some scenarios that are not covered by current unit tests. Ran these on Spark master without the TaskMemoryManager changes to confirm that the behaviour is the same before and after my refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe SPARK-35486 test also provides some coverage for the retry loop.","created_at":"2021-10-05T22:59:29Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T01:25:28Z","closed_at":"2021-10-18T21:51:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ed0ab8a145258fc021f452eb1e6670a90a361ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5725c8de3ccc5fc78b283c4217406fc840807ba2","head":{"label":"timarmstrong:cleanup-task-memory-manager","ref":"cleanup-task-memory-manager","sha":"5725c8de3ccc5fc78b283c4217406fc840807ba2","user":{"login":"timarmstrong","id":1156011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTYwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1156011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong","html_url":"https://github.com/timarmstrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":351190202,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTExOTAyMDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"timarmstrong/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"timarmstrong","id":1156011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTYwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1156011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong","html_url":"https://github.com/timarmstrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timarmstrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/timarmstrong/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to support reading and writing ANSI intervals from/to ORC datasources.\r\n\r\nyear-month and day-time intervals are mapped to ORC's `int` and `bigint` respectively,\r\nTo preserve the Catalyst's types, this change adds `spark.sql.catalyst.type` attribute for each ORC's type information.\r\nThe value of the attribute is the value returned by `YearMonthIntervalType.typeName` or `DayTimeIntervalType.typeName`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better usability. There should be no reason to prohibit from reading/writing ANSI intervals from/to ORC datasources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2021-10-05T07:40:45Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T07:49:21Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T07:49:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5cfbd9c3b921dcd5f1b43738edf297c45407d52c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c72b5cee338decf44c3e520e9c3108d3b4762808","head":{"label":"sarutak:ansi-interval-orc-source","ref":"ansi-interval-orc-source","sha":"c72b5cee338decf44c3e520e9c3108d3b4762808","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refactor typing logic for multi-index support that was mostly introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34176\r\n\r\nAt a high level, the below functions were introduced\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n_extract_types # renamed from `extract_types`\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n_is_named_params\r\n_address_named_type_hoders\r\n_to_tuple_of_params\r\n_convert_tuples_to_zip\r\n_address_unnamed_type_holders\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, they become as below with simplification:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n_to_type_holders # renamed from `_extract_types`\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n_new_type_holders # merged from `_is_named_params`, etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the codes easier to read.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that ambiguous self join can't be detected if the left and right DataFrame are swapped.\r\nThis is an example.\r\n```\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, 2, \"A1\"),(2, 1, \"A2\")).toDF(\"key1\", \"key2\", \"value\")\r\nval df2 = df1.filter($\"value\" === \"A2\")\r\n\r\ndf1.join(df2, df1(\"key1\") === df2(\"key2\")) // Ambiguous self join is detected and AnalysisException is thrown.\r\n\r\ndf2.join(df1, df1(\"key1\") === df2(\"key2)) // Ambiguous self join is not detected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems that an inner function `collectConflictPlans` in `DeduplicateRelations.` doesn't copy the `dataset_id` tag when it copies a `LogicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2021-10-04T18:54:31Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T02:17:28Z","closed_at":"2021-10-05T03:17:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2937a4fe545f62740f5376d66c2ab0819d1ea6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7c1f657e78a61a95333687d7b76fc392b6281e0","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-deduplication-issue","ref":"fix-deduplication-issue","sha":"d7c1f657e78a61a95333687d7b76fc392b6281e0","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to handle ANSI interval types by the `Abs` expression, and the `abs()` function as a consequence of that:\r\n- for positive and zero intervals, `ABS()` returns the same input value,\r\n- for minimal supported values (`Int.MinValue` months for year-month interval and `Long.MinValue` microseconds for day-time interval), `ABS()` throws the arithmetic overflow exception.\r\n- for other supported negative intervals, `ABS()` negate its input and returns a positive interval.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT ABS(INTERVAL -'10-8' YEAR TO MONTH);\r\n10-8\r\nspark-sql> SELECT ABS(INTERVAL '-10 01:02:03.123456' DAY TO SECOND);\r\n10 01:02:03.123456000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this PR just extends `ABS()` by supporting new types.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ArithmeticExpressionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z interval.sql\"\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMigrating a Spark application from 2.4.x to 3.1.x and finding a difference in the exception chaining behavior. In a case of parsing a malformed CSV, where the root cause exception should be Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Malformed CSV record, only the top level exception is kept, and all lower level exceptions and root cause are lost. Thus, when we call ExceptionUtils.getRootCause on the exception, we still get itself.\r\nThe reason for the difference is that RuntimeException is wrapped in BadRecordException, which has unserializable fields. When we try to serialize the exception from tasks and deserialize from scheduler, the exception is lost.\r\nThis PR makes unserializable fields of BadRecordException transient, so the rest of the exception could be serialized and deserialized properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake BadRecordException serializable\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser could get root cause of BadRecordException\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRather than using `DataType.sameType` for comparing structs when unioning by name, only compare the names and orders of the fields, since all we are doing is determining if we need to recreate the struct in a different order. After ResolveUnion is done, the normal union will handle if the types are incompatible or not.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adds a check to the recursive struct handling as well, so we don't have to recreate a nested struct if only one of its parents or siblings are different.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPerformance improvement, especially with nested nullable structs, which get wrapped in an If(IsNull()). Unioning three or more structs can explode the plan due to the multiple structs created extracting values from If(IsNull()) values when the projections are collapsed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, just a performance improvement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test for the helper method, and existing tests still pass.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-04T01:24:43Z","updated_at":"2021-10-07T15:07:10Z","closed_at":"2021-10-07T02:27:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"772cb62c3092e2b8b0277cc533b4ea5a3e2b2aa8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/43f14d7b945af0464a32d64734591dd78b9a3478","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:union-by-name-ignore-types","ref":"union-by-name-ignore-types","sha":"43f14d7b945af0464a32d64734591dd78b9a3478","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInline type hints for python/pyspark/sql/conf.py from Inline type hints for python/pyspark/sql/conf.pyi.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is type hint stub files python/pyspark/sql/conf.pyi to show the expected types for functions, but we can also take advantage of static type checking within the functions by inlining the type hints.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExited UT.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix `DataFrameGroupBy.apply` without shortcut.\r\n\r\nPandas' `DataFrameGroupBy.apply` sometimes behaves weirdly when the udf returns `Series` and whether there is only one group or more. E.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame(\r\n...      {\"a\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], \"b\": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], \"c\": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]},\r\n...      columns=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],\r\n... )\r\n\r\n>>> pdf.groupby('b').apply(lambda x: x['a'])\r\nb\r\n1  0    1\r\n   1    2\r\n2  2    3\r\n3  3    4\r\n5  4    5\r\n8  5    6\r\nName: a, dtype: int64\r\n>>> pdf[pdf['b'] == 1].groupby('b').apply(lambda x: x['a'])\r\na  0  1\r\nb\r\n1  1  2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is only one group, it returns a \"wide\" `DataFrame` instead of `Series`.\r\n\r\nIn our non-shortcut path, there is always only one group because it will be run in `groupby-applyInPandas`, so we will get `DataFrame`, then we should convert it to `Series` ourselves.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`DataFrameGroupBy.apply` without shortcut could raise an exception when it returns `Series`.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> ps.options.compute.shortcut_limit = 3\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame(\r\n...     {\"a\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], \"b\": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8], \"c\": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]},\r\n...     columns=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],\r\n... )\r\n>>> psdf.groupby(\"b\").apply(lambda x: x[\"a\"])\r\norg.apache.spark.api.python.PythonException: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 2 elements, new values have 3 elements\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe error above will be gone:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf.groupby(\"b\").apply(lambda x: x[\"a\"])\r\nb\r\n1  0    1\r\n   1    2\r\n2  2    3\r\n3  3    4\r\n5  4    5\r\n8  5    6\r\nName: a, dtype: int64\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

Specifically, we don't check this in `registerWithExternalShuffleServer()` in `BlockManager` and `createLocalDirsForMergedShuffleBlocks()` in `DiskBlockManager.scala` as the same issue would raise otherwise.\r\n\r\n- Move `instantiateClassFromConf` and `instantiateClass` from `SparkEnv` into `Utils`, in order to let `isPushBasedShuffleEnabled` to leverage them for instantiating serializer instances.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Serializer creation can happen in `isPushBasedShuffleEnabled`, which can be called in some places prior to SparkEnv is created. Also, as per analysis by @JoshRosen, this is probably due to Kryo instantiation was failing because added packages hadn't been downloaded to the executor yet (because this code is running during executor startup, not task startup).

this pull request?\r\nDisabled Batch fetch when push based shuffle is enabled. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this patch, enabling AQE and Push based shuffle will have a chance to hang the tasks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested the PR within our PR, with Spark shell and the queries

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to support reading and writing ANSI intervals from/to JSON datasources.\r\nAith this change, a interval data is written as a literal form like `{\"col\":\"INTERVAL '1-2' YEAR TO MONTH\"}`.\r\nFor the reading part, we need to specify the schema explicitly like:\r\n```\r\nval readDF = spark.read.schema(\"col INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH\").json(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better usability. There should be no reason to prohibit from reading/writing ANSI intervals from/to JSON datasources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test. It covers both V1 and V2 sources.","created_at":"2021-09-30T06:53:48Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T20:36:10Z","closed_at":"2021-09-30T17:22:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd4be9ca6d96603292ffbe3a7bf8ceaa2f826af2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb1c22a58ff40dfc52ef3daba6f1e826e38b18b6","head":{"label":"sarutak:ansi-interval-json-source","ref":"ansi-interval-json-source","sha":"cb1c22a58ff40dfc52ef3daba6f1e826e38b18b6","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR overloads the `lpad` and `rpad` functions to work correctly with BINARY string inputs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior of the `lpad` and `rpad` functions is problematic. BINARY string inputs get converted automatically to UTF8 strings and then padded. The result can be an invalid UTF8 string.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. We are adding overloads for `lpad` and `rpad` for BINARY strings. This PR should be viewed as a breaking change in the sense that the result of `lpad` and `rpad` for BINARY string inputs is now BINARY string, as opposed to the previous behavior which was returning a UTF8 string.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2021-09-30T06:28:09Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T13:24:48Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T13:24:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57fe575259d9e24b2fbe25f6e35507adf62a4410","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9027989529ff3bbf5f79d2d2022981b0a36db97f","head":{"label":"mkaravel:binary-lpad-rpad","ref":"binary-lpad-rpad","sha":"9027989529ff3bbf5f79d2d2022981b0a36db97f","user":{"login":"mkaravel","id":6397014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTcwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6397014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel","html_url":"https://github.com/mkaravel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":408710293,"node_id":"R_kgDOGFxslQ","name":"spark","full_name":"mkaravel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkaravel","id":6397014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTcwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6397014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel","html_url":"https://github.com/mkaravel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkaravel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkaravel/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn order to pass the UTs related to sql/core and dependent modules, this pr mainly does the following change:\r\n\r\n- Add a new property named `extraJavaTestArgs` to `pom.xml`, It includes all `--add-opens` configurations required for UTs with Java 17 and It also include `-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` to compatible with Java 8.\r\n- Add a new helper class named `JavaModuleOptions` to place constant and methods related to `--add-opens`\r\n- `--add-opens` options and `-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` is added by default when `SparkSubmitCommandBuilder` builds the submit command, this can help `local-cluster` related UTs pass and help users reduce the cost of using java 17\r\n- `--add-opens` options and `-XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions` is supplemented to `spark.driver.extraJavaOptions` and `spark.executor.extraJavaOptions` when init SparkContext, this also can help UTs pass and help users reduce the cost of using java 17\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass Spark UTs with JDK 17\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Manual test `mvn clean install -pl sql/core -am` with Java 17, only `select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello')` in `postgreSQL/text.sql` failed due to the different behavior of Java 8 and Java 17\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-30T04:09:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T17:28:11Z","closed_at":"2021-10-19T13:59:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33036b25f8dc010eaf78bd9aadcd6f9aa42018d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7265c9168cb4669e9465f88e42a284f8a35dad0","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-36796","ref":"SPARK-36796","sha":"c7265c9168cb4669e9465f88e42a284f8a35dad0","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new test suite `ParquetVectorizedSuite` to provide more coverage on vectorized Parquet decoding logic, with different combinations on column index, dictionary, batch size, page size, etc.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the test, this also refactored `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` and makes the Parquet row group reader pluggable. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `ParquetIOSuite` and `ParquetColumnIndexSuite` only test on the high-level API which is insufficient, especially after the introduction of column index support, for which we want to cover various combinations involving row ranges, first row index, batch size, page size, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the 2nd PR for DSv2 index support.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following:\r\n\r\n- create index syntax support in parser and analyzer\r\n- `CreateIndex` logic node\r\n- `CreateIndexExec` physical node\r\n\r\n`CreateIndex` is not implemented yet in this PR. Calling `CreateIndex` will throw `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, and the parsed index information such as `IndexName` `indexType` `columns` and index properties will be included in the error message for now for testing purpose.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support index in DSv2\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the create table syntax as the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE INDEX index_name ON [TABLE] table_name [USING index_type] (column_index_property_list)[OPTIONS indexPropertyList]\r\n\r\n    column_index_property_list: column_name [OPTIONS(indexPropertyList)]  [ ,  . . . ]\r\n    indexPropertyList: index_property_name [= index_property_value] [ ,  . . . ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently `dropTempView` and `dropGlobalTempView` don't have return value, which conflicts with their docstring:\r\n`Returns true if this view is dropped successfully, false otherwise.`. And that's not consistent with the same API in other languages.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes a fix for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBe consistent with API in other languages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n#### From\r\n```py\r\n# dropTempView\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1)]).createTempView(\"my_table\")\r\n>>>
