What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is an improvement, we mount all the user specific configuration files(except the templates and spark properties files) from `SPARK_CONF_DIR` at the point of spark-submit, to both executor and driver pods. Currently, only `spark.properties` is mounted, only on driver.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`SPARK_CONF_DIR` hosts several configuration files, for example, \r\n1) `spark-defaults.conf` - containing all the spark properties.\r\n2) `log4j.properties` - Logger configuration.\r\n3) `core-site.xml` - Hadoop related configuration.\r\n4) `fairscheduler.xml` - Spark's fair scheduling policy at the job level.\r\n5) `metrics.properties` - Spark metrics.\r\n6) Any user specific - library or framework specific configuration file.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we can cannot propagate these files to the driver and executor configuration directory.\r\n\r\nThere is a design doc, with more details, and this patch is currently providing a reference implementation. Please take a look at the doc and comment, how we can improve. [google docs link to the doc](https://bit.ly/spark-30985)\r\n\r\n### Further scope\r\nSupport user defined configMaps.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, previously the user configuration files(e.g. hdfs-site.xml, log4j.properties etc...) were not propagated by default, now after this patch it is propagated to driver and executor pods' `SPARK_CONF_DIR`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests.\r\n\r\nAlso manually tested, by deploying it to a minikube cluster and observing the additional configuration files were present, and taking effect. For example, changes to log4j.properties was properly applied to executors.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-28T11:15:59Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T02:51:25Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T08:02:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af1c2d91a7d60235fb5f1e488ddf6dacf6e9d80c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27735/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27735/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27735/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba93111b8ccfc7958e4facf57280a7c980beed84","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:SPARK-30985/spark-conf-k8s-propagate","ref":"SPARK-30985/spark-conf-k8s-propagate","sha":"ba93111b8ccfc7958e4facf57280a7c980beed84","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR try to fix a bug in `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.ScriptTransformationExec`. This bug appears in our online cluster.  `ScriptTransformationExec` should throw an exception, when user uses a python script which contains parse error.  But current implementation may miss this case of failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen user uses a python script which contains a parse error, there will be no output. So  `scriptOutputReader.next(scriptOutputWritable) <= 0` matches, then we use `checkFailureAndPropagate()` to check the `proc`.  But the `proc` may still be alive and `writerThread.exception` is not defined,  `checkFailureAndPropagate` cannot check this case of failure.  In the end, the Spark SQL job runs successfully and returns no result. In fact, the SparK SQL job should fails and shows the exception properly.\r\n\r\nFor example, the error python script is blow.\r\n``` python\r\n# encoding: utf8\r\nimport unknow_module\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nfor line in sys.stdin:\r\n    print line\r\n``` \r\nThe bug can be reproduced by running the following code in our cluter.\r\n```\r\nspark.range(100*100).toDF(\"index\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"test\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select TRANSFORM(index) USING 'python error_python.py' as new_index from test\").collect.foreach(println)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake rule `PruneHiveTablePartitions` to execute as `earlyScanPushDownRules`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to rule `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, `PruneHiveTablePartitions` should also be executed as earlyScanPushDownRules to eliminate the impact on statistic computation later.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRemove automatically resource coordination support from Standalone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nResource coordination is mainly designed for the scenario where multiple workers launched on the same host. However, it's, actually, a non-existed  scenario for today's Spark. Because, Spark now can start multiple executors in a single Worker, while it only allow one executor per Worker at very beginning. So, now, it really help nothing for user to launch multiple workers on the same host. Thus, it's not worth for us to bring over complicated implementation and potential high maintain cost for such an impossible scenario.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's Spark 3.0 feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`testthat` version was pinned to `1.0.2` at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/f15102b1702b64a54233ae31357e32335722f4e5 due to compatibility issue in SparkR.\r\nThe compatibility issue is finally fixed as of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/298d0a5102e54ddc24f114e83d2b936762722eec and we now use testthat latest version.\r\n\r\nNow we don't need to install `crayon', 'praise' and 'R6' as they are dependences in testthat (https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/blob/master/DESCRIPTION).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo minimise build specification and prevent dependency confusion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo. Dev only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAppVeyor build will test it out.","created_at":"2020-02-27T01:35:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:16:01Z","closed_at":"2020-02-27T08:18:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7704978d109ff838fbe60343d65991c8b9591e1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROJECT%20INFRA","name":"PROJECT

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSpark uses the class `InMemoryStore` as the KV storage for live UI and history server(by default if no LevelDB file path is provided).\r\nIn `InMemoryStore`, all the task data in one application is stored in a hashmap, which key is the task ID and the value is the task data. This fine for getting or deleting with a provided task ID.\r\nHowever, Spark stage UI always shows all the task data in one stage and the current implementation is to look up all the values in the hashmap. The time complexity is O(numOfTasks).\r\nAlso, when there are too many stages (>spark.ui.retainedStages), Spark will linearly try to look up all the task data of the stages to be deleted as well.\r\n\r\nThis can be very bad for a large application with many stages and tasks. We can improve it by allowing the natural key of an entity to have a real parent index. So that on each lookup with parent node provided, Spark can look up all the natural keys(in our case, the task IDs) first, and then find the data with the natural keys in the hashmap.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe in-memory KV store becomes really slow for large applications. We can improve it with a new index. The performance can be 10 times, 100 times, even 1000 times faster.\r\nThis is also possible to make the Spark driver more stable for large applications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\nAlso, I run a benchmark with the following code\r\n```\r\n  val store = new InMemoryStore()\r\n  val numberOfTasksPerStage = 10000\r\n   (0 until 1000).map { sId =>\r\n     (0 until numberOfTasksPerStage).map { taskId =>\r\n       val task = newTaskData(sId * numberOfTasksPerStage + taskId, \"SUCCESS\", sId)\r\n       store.write(task)\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n  val appStatusStore = new AppStatusStore(store)\r\n  var start = System.nanoTime()\r\n  appStatusStore.taskSummary(2, attemptId, Array(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))\r\n  println(\"task summary run time: \" + ((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000))\r\n  val stageIds = Seq(1, 11, 66, 88)\r\n  val stageKeys = stageIds.map(Array(_, attemptId))\r\n  start = System.nanoTime()\r\n  store.removeAllByIndexValues(classOf[TaskDataWrapper], TaskIndexNames.STAGE,\r\n    stageKeys.asJavaCollection)\r\n   println(\"clean up tasks run time: \" + ((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000))\r\n```\r\n\r\nTask summary before the changes: 98642ms\r\nTask summary after the changes: 120ms\r\n\r\nTask clean up before the changes:  4900ms\r\nTask clean up before the changes: 4ms\r\n\r\nIt's 800x faster after the changes in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix `cache` initialization in `StringRegexExpression` by changing of expected value type in `case Literal(value: String,

has type `UTF8String`, see\r\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-02-08 at 22 45 50\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhenever timestamps are turned into strings (`Column.cast(StringType)`, `date_format(timestamp, format)`, `Dataset.show()`) the default time zone is used to format the string. This default time zone is either the java default zone `user.timezone`, the Spark default zone `spark.sql.session.timeZone` or the default DataFrameWriter zone `timeZone`. Currently there is no way to format a single column in a different timezone.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"Europe/London\")\r\nscala> spark.range(10). \\\r\n         select(concat(lit(\"2020-02-01 0\"), $\"id\", lit(\":00:00\")).cast(TimestampType).as(\"time\")). \\\r\n         select(\r\n           $\"time\",\r\n           date_format($\"time\", \"uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZZ\").as(\"local\"),\r\n           date_format_tz($\"time\", \"uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZZ\", \"Europe/Berlin\").as(\"Berlin\")\r\n         ). \\\r\n         show(false)\r\n+-------------------+---------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|time               |local                |Berlin                    |\r\n+-------------------+---------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|2020-02-01 00:00:00|2020-02-01 00:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 01:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 01:00:00|2020-02-01 01:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 02:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 02:00:00|2020-02-01 02:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 03:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 03:00:00|2020-02-01 03:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 04:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 04:00:00|2020-02-01 04:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 05:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 05:00:00|2020-02-01 05:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 06:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 06:00:00|2020-02-01 06:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 07:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 07:00:00|2020-02-01 07:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 08:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 08:00:00|2020-02-01 08:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 09:00:00 +01:00|\r\n|2020-02-01 09:00:00|2020-02-01 09:00:00 Z|2020-02-01 10:00:00 +01:00|\r\n+-------------------+---------------------+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFormatting timestamps in timezones other than the default one requires a laborious UDF while a very similar operation `date_format` with all the code exists already.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it introduces a new SQL operation `date_format_tz`.

The fallback was removed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26178 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26243.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds back this legacy fallback. Since we switch the API to do datetime operations, we can't be exactly the same as before. Here we add back the support of the legacy formats that are common (examples of Spark 2.4):\r\n1. the fields can have one or two letters\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"1123-2-22 2:22:22\"}', 'time Timestamp')\"\"\").show(false)\r\n+-------------------------------------------+\r\n|jsontostructs({\"time\":\"1123-2-22 2:22:22\"})|\r\n+-------------------------------------------+\r\n|[1123-02-22 02:22:22]                      |\r\n+-------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n2. the separator between data and time can be \"T\" as well\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"2000-12-12T12:12:12\"}', 'time Timestamp')\"\"\").show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------+\r\n|jsontostructs({\"time\":\"2000-12-12T12:12:12\"})|\r\n+---------------------------------------------+\r\n|[2000-12-12 12:12:12]                        |\r\n+---------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n3. the second fraction can be arbitrary length\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"1123-02-22T02:22:22.123456789123\"}', 'time Timestamp')\"\"\").show(false)\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|jsontostructs({\"time\":\"1123-02-22T02:22:22.123456789123\"})|\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[1123-02-15 02:22:22.123]                                 |\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n4. date string can end up with any chars after \"T\" or space\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"1123-02-22Tabc\"}', 'time date')\"\"\").show(false)\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|jsontostructs({\"time\":\"1123-02-22Tabc\"})|\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n|[1123-02-22]                            |\r\n+----------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n5. remove \"GMT\" from the string before parsing\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"GMT1123-2-22 2:22:22.123\"}', 'time Timestamp')\"\"\").show(false)\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n|jsontostructs({\"time\":\"GMT1123-2-22 2:22:22.123\"})|\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[1123-02-22 02:22:22.123]                         |\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt doesn't hurt to keep this legacy support. It just makes the parsing more relaxed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, to make 3.0 support parsing most of the csv/json values that were supported before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

This exception, though, has a typo making it confusing. Yet apparently, this same exception for NaN values is fine. Fixed it to look like the right one.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEncountering this error with such message was very confusing! I hope to save time of fellow engineers by improving it.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt's just an error message...\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's not needed at all as now we replace \"y\" with \"u\" if there is no \"G\". So the era is either explicitly specified (e.g. \"yyyy G\") or can be inferred from the year (e.g. \"uuuu\").\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBy default we use \"uuuu\" as the year pattern, which indicates the era already. If we set a default era, it can get conflicted and fail the parsing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyea, now spark can parse date/timestamp with negative year via the \"yyyy\" pattern, which will be converted to \"uuuu\" under the hood.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3/ in Jenkins\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveSerDeSuite.Test the default fileformat for Hive-serde tables\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe profile is same as PR builder but seems it fails specifically in this machine. \r\n\r\nSeveral configurations used in `HiveSerDeSuite` are not being set presumably due to the inconsistency between `SQLConf.get` and the active Spark session described in the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27387, and as a side effect of the cloned session at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27659.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly set the configuration against `TestHive` by using `withExistingConf` at `withSQLConf`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make `spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3` job pass.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCannot reproduce in my local.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27387 (see https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3/202/), the tests below fail consistently, specifically in one job https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3/ in Jenkins\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveShowCreateTableSuite.simple hive table\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveShowCreateTableSuite.simple external hive table\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveShowCreateTableSuite.hive bucketing is supported\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe profile is same as PR builder but seems it fails specifically in this machine. Seems the legacy configuration `spark.sql.legacy.createHiveTableByDefault.enabled` is not being set due to the inconsistency between `SQLConf.get` and the active Spark session as described in the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27387.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly set the configuration against the session used instead of `SQLConf.get`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make `spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3` job pass.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCannot reproduce in my local. Presumably it cannot be reproduced in the PR builder. We should see if the tests pass at `spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7-hive-2.3` job after this PR is

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen aliasing in nested column pruning in Project on top of Generate, we should exclude Generate outputs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now we would prune nested columns in Project on top of Generate. It is possible that referred nested columns are from Generate's outputs, not from its child. To address that case, we should exclude Generate outputs when aliasing in nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDon't allow drivers to use all the cores in spark standalone scheduler. Reserve some cores for apps\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAirflow is triggering many Spark jobs in parallel, spark standalone gets 'full' with drivers and can never execute apps as drivers took all the cores. The spark cluster essentially becomes stuck and never completes any drivers (as no cores avail to run the associated apps), never frees up cores.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`spark.driver.cores` configuration is used to set the amount of parallelism in kubernetes cluster mode drivers. Previously the amount of parallelism in the drivers were the number of cores in the host when running on JDK 8u120 or older, or the maximum of driver containers resource requests and limits when running on [JDK 8u121 or newer](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8173345). This will enable users to specify `spark.driver.cores` to set parallelism, and specify `spark.kubernetes.driver.requests.cores` to limit the resource requests of the driver container, effectively decoupling the two\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDrivers submitted in kubernetes cluster mode set the parallelism of various components like `RpcEnv`, `MemoryManager`, `BlockManager` from inferring the number of available cores by calling `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`. By using this, spark applications running on JDK 8u120 or older incorrectly get the total number of cores in the host, [ignoring the cgroup limits set by kubernetes](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6515172). JDK 8u121 and newer runtimes do not have this problem.\r\n\r\nOrthogonal to this, it is currently not possible to decouple resource limits on the driver container with the amount of parallelism of the various network and memory components listed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Previously the amount of parallelism in kubernetes cluster mode submitted drivers were the number of cores in the host when running on JDK 8u120 or older, or the maximum of driver containers resource requests and limits when running on JDK 8u121 or newer. Now the value of `spark.driver.cores` is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nhappy to add tests if my proposal looks

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch uses DataInputStream / DataOutputStream to serialize/deserialize entry on FileStream(Source/Sink)Log, as well as applying LZ4 compression on serde.\r\n\r\nThe ground idea is that both FileEntry and SinkFileStatus haven't been changed for 3 years but we have been simply taking JSON serde to prepare with possible change and spending bunch of overhead on JSON format. CompactibleFileStreamLog has the metadata version information but it has been just version 1.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces metadata version 2 of CompactibleFileStreamLog as leveraging DataInputStream / DataOutputStream & LZ4 compression. While we introduce version 2 for CompactibleFileStreamLog, CompactibleFileStreamLog is still compatible with version 1 for both serialization and deserialization, so we can read from version 2 and write to version 2 in normal, and also we can read from version 1 and write to version 2 for smooth migration.\r\n\r\nThere's some exceptional case on file stream sink, which outputs are possibly read by older version of Spark. To support such case, a new configuration (`spark.sql.streaming.fileSink.log.writeMetadataVersion`) is introduced to specify the write version of the metadata on file stream sink. If specified, further batch log files will be written via the write version. This doesn't rewrite the existing batch log files, so if the query is started from existing metadata, the query should be run at least for next compact batch so that the metadata log of compact batch can be written via the write version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMultiple JIRA issues have been filed to report that huge metadata logs make their queries very slow. While this patch won't make their metadata log stop growing, this patch may heavily reduce down their metadata log and time to process compaction.\r\n\r\n* [SPARK-24295](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24295)\r\n* [SPARK-29995](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29995)\r\n\r\nPlease find the numbers in the section \"How was this patch tested?\".\r\n\r\nAs this also reduces the latency to read all files from file stream sink metadata, it also helps to speed up the query for both batch and streaming if the input path is pointing to the output of file stream sink.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFurther metadata log files will be written by configured write version for file stream sink. For other compatible metadata logs, further metadata log files will be written by version 2.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Existing UTs (UTs for checking with 2.1.0 compatibility is basically the checking with V1 compatibility, as I don't find any change)\r\n* Manually done simple perf. test\r\n\r\nNote that the version 4 in the experiment is now taken as version 2 in this patch.\r\n\r\nThis is the experiment branch: https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/tree/SPARK-30946-experiments\r\n\r\n> Version 3 is only applying compaction (LZ4) on existing format. See below commit:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/commit/406670aa4910c4bec847a590ef37f2f0bd130902\r\n\r\n> Version 4 is serializing/deserializing entry via DataInputStream / DataOutputStream\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/commit/7c665163bdd1930fb8812d46a7f8cdd599b1cafb\r\n\r\nI've also implemented simple apps to 1) prepare metadata (so that we can experiment on the specific batch) and 2) run simple test with various versions:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark-delegation-token-experiment/commit/bea7680e4c588f455f8c3181a96c9eff5002fa1a\r\n\r\nThe

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI added GC detection to generate heap when appropriate\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn practice, it was found that executor has a gc loop state, which will cause gc to spend a lot of time. Usually, this situation does not cause OOM, but causes the connection driver to timeout.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUsers can start the detection process via \"spark.jvmQuake.enabled=true\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI added a config parameter\r\n\r\n    spark.sql.hive.supportedSchemesToUseNonBlobstore\r\n\r\nIf the target table's scheme is included in `spark.sql.hive.supportedSchemesToUseNonBlobstore`, then HDFS (MRTempDir) is used.\r\n\r\nMajor benefits of this patch are;\r\n\r\n- Increase performance to write data to blob storage\r\n- Reduce costs for blob storage I/O\r\n- Reduce the effect of eventual consistency\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark writes temporary data into blob storage such as S3, and it affects performance and costs for customers. This pull request is raised to enhance a feature to change temporary data location from blob storage to HDFS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\n\r\n- When `spark.sql.hive.supportedSchemesToUseNonBlobstore=\"\"`, there is no change.\r\n- When `spark.sql.hive.supportedSchemesToUseNonBlobstore=\"s3a,s3\"` and table location starts with `s3a://`, HDFS is used for temporal storage instead of blob storage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Unit test\r\nI added two new unit tests; \r\n- SaveAsHiveFileSuite: Test the temp path for both blob storage and non-blob storage\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt\r\n> project hive\r\n> testOnly *SaveAsHiveFileSuite\r\n...\r\n[info] ScalaTest\r\n[info] Run

configurations in `spark.hadoop.hive.blobstore.use.blobstore.as.scratchdir`.\r\n\r\n##### Data Tables\r\n```\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE plain_cf (\r\n  Date DATE,\r\n  Time STRING,\r\n  Location

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRename config `spark.resources.discovery.plugin` to `spark.resources.discoveryPlugin`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, as a side minor change: labeled `ResourceDiscoveryScriptPlugin` as `DeveloperApi` since it's not for end user.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the tool tip string in Structured Streaming UI graphs to show batch ID (and timestamp as well) instead of only showing timestamp, which was a key for DStream but no longer a key for Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\nThis patch does some refactoring as there're some spots on confusion between js file for streaming and structured streaming.\r\n\r\nNote that this patch doesn't actually change the x axis, as once we change it we should decouple the logic for graphs between streaming and structured streaming. It won't change UX meaningfully as in x axis we only show min and max which we still would like to know about \"time\" as well as batch ID.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Structured Streaming, everything is aligned for \"batch ID\" where the UI is only showing timestamp - end users have to manually find and correlate batch ID and the timestamp which is clearly a huge pain.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nfix the warning for limiting resources when we don't know the number of executor cores. The issue is that there are places in the Spark code that use cores/task cpus to calculate slots and until the entire Stage level scheduling feature is in, we have to rely on the cores being the limiting resource.\r\n\r\nChange the check to only warn when custom resources are specified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nfix the check and warn when we should\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nA warning is printed\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanually tested spark-shell with standalone mode, yarn, local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSet `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` to `false` in `JsonProtocol` to allow ignore unknown fields in a Spark event. After this change, if we add new fields to a Spark event parsed by `ObjectMapper`, the event json string generated by a new Spark version can still be read by an old Spark History Server.\r\n\r\nSince Spark History Server is an extra service, it usually takes time to upgrade, and it's possible that a Spark application is upgraded before SHS. Forwards-compatibility will allow an old SHS to support new Spark applications (may lose some new features but most of functions should still work). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`JsonProtocol` is supposed to provide strong backwards-compatibility and forwards-compatibility guarantees: any version of Spark should be able to read JSON output written by any other version, including newer versions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the forwards-compatibility guarantee is broken for events parsed by `ObjectMapper`. If a new field is added to an event parsed by `ObjectMapper` (e.g., https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/6dc5921e66d56885b95c07e56e687f9f6c1eaca7#diff-dc5c7a41fbb7479cef48b67eb41ad254R33), the event json string generated by a new Spark version cannot be parsed by an old version of SHS right now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new added tests.","created_at":"2020-02-24T06:58:48Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T04:52:30Z","closed_at":"2020-02-25T04:28:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"805f00fc8c64de89b13d90463a1285dbaf7a0b88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b18998c786debecae53d7eaf2c6f4529487a985","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-30936","ref":"SPARK-30936","sha":"9b18998c786debecae53d7eaf2c6f4529487a985","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now `StreamingQueryManager` will keep the last terminated query until `resetTerminated` is called. When the last terminated query has lots of states (a large sql plan, cached RDDs, etc.), it will keep a lot of memory unnecessarily. Actually, what `StreamingQueryManager` really needs is just the exception of the last failed query.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the internal field `lastTerminatedQuery` in `StreamingQueryManager` to remember the last exception rather than the query to save the memory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid keeping memory unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change any public behaviors. The existing tests have covered the touched codes.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-23T21:52:59Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T18:16:00Z","closed_at":"2020-02-24T09:48:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48e6d3bd5d6869b178b7659b60408aaae56134e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8e77f80082ff5853ee014bbc3aa07cd8917ce67","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-30927","ref":"SPARK-30927","sha":"e8e77f80082ff5853ee014bbc3aa07cd8917ce67","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88661206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODY2MTIwNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"zsxwing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Use `Math.multiplyExact()` in `DateTimeUtils.fromMillis()` to prevent silent overflow in conversion milliseconds to microseconds.\r\n- Use `DateTimeUtils.fromMillis()` in all places where milliseconds are converted to microseconds\r\n- Use `DateTimeUtils.toMillis()` in all places where microseconds are converted to milliseconds\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. To prevent silent arithmetic overflow while multiplying by 1000 in `fromMillis()`. Instead of it, `new ArithmeticException(\"long overflow\")` will be thrown, and handled accordantly.\r\n2. To correctly round microseconds in conversion to milliseconds. For example, `1965-01-01 10:11:12.123456` is represented as `-157700927876544` in micro precision.

The config `spark.sql.adaptive.skewedJoinOptimization.skewedPartitionMaxSplits`  is to resolve the above ui shown issue. And after [PR#27493](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27493) combined the skewed readers into one, we not need this config.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nremove the unnecessary config\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior of interval multiply and divide follows the ANSI SQL standard when overflow, it is compatible with other operations when `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is true, but not compatible when `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is false.\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is false, as the factor is a double value, so it should use java's rounding or truncation behavior for casting double to integrals. when divided by zero, it returns `null`.  we also follow the natural rules for intervals as defined in the Gregorian calendar, so we do not add the month fraction to days but add days fraction to microseconds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake interval multiply and divide's overflow behavior consistent with other interval operations\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno, these are new features in 3.0\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the regression caused by #22173.\r\nThe original PR changes the logic of handling `ChunkFetchReqeust` from async to sync, that's causes the shuffle benchmark regression. This PR fixes the regression back to the async mode by reusing the config `spark.shuffle.server.chunkFetchHandlerThreadsPercent`.\r\nWhen the user sets the config, ChunkFetchReqeust will be processed in a separate event loop group, otherwise, the code path is exactly the same as before.\r\n\r\nAs the creation of the separate event loop group is disabled by default, this PR also is a kind of revert for SPARK-25641.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the shuffle performance regression described in  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22173#issuecomment-572459561\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR disable the separate event loop for FetchRequest by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-21T08:54:31Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T03:03:42Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T04:38:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d05997fd8cf7ec5b6e24b2a69d7e5a31fed4953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605327,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MzI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SHUFFLE","name":"SHUFFLE","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f42083b43058d8f7276e5f095dc4b432c8b2b71","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-24355-follow","ref":"SPARK-24355-follow","sha":"4f42083b43058d8f7276e5f095dc4b432c8b2b71","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the new method `getLatestBatchId()` in CompactibleFileStreamLog in complement of getLatest() which doesn't read the content of the latest batch metadata log file, and apply to both FileStreamSource and FileStreamSink to avoid unnecessary latency on reading log file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOnce compacted metadata log file becomes huge, writing outputs for the compact + 1 batch is also affected due to unnecessarily reading the compacted metadata log file. This unnecessary latency can be simply avoided.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to replace functions in DateTimeUtils that convert dates to/from \"timestamp\" in millisecond precision.\r\n\r\n1. Replace millisToDays by microsToDays in DateTimeUtils.\r\n2. Replace daysToMillis by daysToMicros in DateTimeUtils.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark should reduce overhead costs to convert dates to a timestamp in milliseconds as TimestamType values in the Catalyst are stored as microseconds. Recently we switched to Java 8 time API so we do not need to convert to milliseconds. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins with the existing tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix the thread-safety issue in turning off AQE for CacheManager by cloning the current session and changing the AQE conf on the cloned session.\r\nThis PR also adds a utility function for cloning the session with AQE disabled conf value, which can be shared by another caller.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the potential thread-unsafe problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested CachedTableSuite with AQE settings

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add the `legacySizeOfNull ` parameter to the `Size` expression, and pass the value of `spark.sql.legacy.sizeOfNull` if `legacySizeOfNull` is not provided on creation of `Size`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows to avoid the issue when the configuration change between different phases of planning, and this can silently break a query plan which can lead to crashes or data corruption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPrevious exemple given for spark-streaming-kinesis was true for Apache Spark < 2.3.0. After that the method used in exemple became deprecated:\r\n@deprecated(\"use initialPosition(initialPosition: KinesisInitialPosition)\", \"2.3.0\")\r\ndef initialPositionInStream(initialPosition: InitialPositionInStream)\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the doc on rewriting exemple in Scala/Java (remain unchanged in Python) to adapt Apache Spark 2.4.0 + releases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt introduces some confusion for developers to test their spark-streaming-kinesis exemple.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nIn my opinion, the change is only about the documentation level, so I did not add any special test.","created_at":"2020-02-20T17:38:53Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T02:16:22Z","closed_at":"2020-02-25T02:16:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d44e4c77a6f5f402916623779d64b35beb60806d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef34739d81f638a20ec5c886c690c127c98b6ba9","head":{"label":"duoxoud:SPARK-30901","ref":"SPARK-30901","sha":"ef34739d81f638a20ec5c886c690c127c98b6ba9","user":{"login":"duoxoud","id":13203891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAzODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13203891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud","html_url":"https://github.com/duoxoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241893794,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDE4OTM3OTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"duoxoud/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"duoxoud","id":13203891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjAzODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13203891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud","html_url":"https://github.com/duoxoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duoxoud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/duoxoud/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses the case where compact metadata file is read twice in FileStreamSource during restarting query.\r\n\r\nWhen restarting the query, there is a case which the query starts from compaction batch, and the batch has source metadata file to read. One case is that the previous query succeeded to read from inputs, but not finalized the batch for various reasons.\r\n\r\nThe patch finds the latest compaction batch when restoring from metadata log, and put entries for the batch into the file entry cache which would avoid reading compact batch file twice.\r\n\r\nFileStreamSourceLog doesn't know about offset / commit metadata in checkpoint so doesn't know which exactly batch to start from, but in practice, only couple of latest batches are candidates to\r\nbe started from when restarting query. This patch leverages the fact to skip calculation if possible.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark incurs unnecessary cost on reading the compact metadata file twice on some case, which may not be ignorable when the query has been processed huge number of files so far.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf we have a shortType column in our table, filter will not be pushed down for the following query:\r\n`select * from t where id = 2;`\r\npushed filter ->\r\n`PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(id)], ReadSchema: struct<id:smallint>`\r\n\r\n2 is within short range still filter is not pushed down. \r\nBut it pushes filter if we cast the literal to smallint: \r\n`select * from t where id = cast(2 as smallint) ; `\r\npushed filter ->\r\n` PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(id), EqualTo(id,2)], ReadSchema: struct<id:smallint>`\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, there is no need to explicitly convert literals to short/byte for filter pushdown:\r\n\r\n`Select * from t where id = 2;`\r\npushed filter ->\r\n`PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(id), EqualTo(id,2)], ReadSchema: struct<id:smallint>`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are needed because whenever we want to pushdown filters for short/byte value we have to explicitly cast them to short/byte even if the value is well within short/byte range.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, now users dont need to explicitly cast literals to short/byte for filter pushdown.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually. UT will be added soon.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-20T13:36:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T03:54:57Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T03:54:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3592d76cfeab9526eab6358590e5a3313dfcbb5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ee3d424b2a9270a3cb910ce363d1ab4c7f81655","head":{"label":"iRakson:SPARK-24994","ref":"SPARK-24994","sha":"5ee3d424b2a9270a3cb910ce363d1ab4c7f81655","user":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205127207,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDUxMjcyMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"iRakson/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExclude the SQL config `spark.sql.variable.substitute.depth` from `SQLConf.removedSQLConfigs`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy the #27169, the config was placed to `SQLConf.removedSQLConfigs`. And as a consequence of that when an user set it non-default value (1 for example),  he/she will get an exception. It is acceptable for SQL configs that could impact on the behavior but not for this particular config. Raising of such exception will just make migration to Spark 3.0 more difficult.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, before the changes users get an exception when he/she set `spark.sql.variable.substitute.depth` to a value different from `40`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun `spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.variable.substitute.depth\", 1)` in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Output warnings for deprecated SQL configs in `SQLConf. setConfWithCheck()` and in `SQLConf. unsetConf()`\r\n- Throw an exception for removed SQL configs in `SQLConf. setConfWithCheck()` when they set to non-default values\r\n- Remove checking of deprecated and removed SQL configs from RuntimeConfig\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, warnings/exceptions are printed only when a SQL config is set dynamically, for instance via `spark.conf.set()`. After the changes, removed/deprecated SQL configs will be checked when they set statically.

It was removed to prevent errors like SPARK-23173 for non-default value.\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.hive.verifyPartitionPath=false\r\nscala> spark.emptyDataFrame\r\n20/02/20 02:10:26 WARN SQLConf: The SQL config 'spark.sql.hive.verifyPartitionPath' has been deprecated in Spark v3.0 and may be removed in the future.
