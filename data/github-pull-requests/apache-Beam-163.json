Python SDK definition.

The reverted PR seems to be the only one providing changes in java SDK after which the tests started timeouting. I started the Dataflow VR tests to see if they pass without the reverted change.*\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

changes to the FnApiRunner prepare it to work on the streaming case. Changes, in general are:\r\n\r\n- Execution now is driven by executing available early work.\r\n  - Before this change, execution was driven by fully executing each stage one by one.\r\n- There is a primitive watermark manager that tracks the advancement of the watermark across the pipeline.\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n- Support for TestStream, to enable streaming-based testing of the FnApiRunner.\r\n- Creating a first streaming source.\r\n\r\n**Worth noting:**\r\n- Note that commit https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10291/commits/da37922 changes the behavior of a particular corner case.\r\n- A number of SDF-related tests are skipped on multiworkers. [BEAM-8833](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8833) was filed to track what is the potential issue here.\r\n\r\n**Benchmarking:**\r\n\r\nRan the `fn_api_runner_microbenchmark`. For this benchmark, the most important metric is Fixed Cost, as it generally calculates the cost of overhead of running all of the stages (fixed number of stages). The overhead is about 6% (`avg(with change)/avg(without) - 1`).\r\n\r\nWithout changes:\r\n\r\nRun | Fixed Cost | Per Element\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nRun 1 | 4.740000717798869 |  0.006113449501268791\r\nRun 2 | 4.835741568883261 |  0.005539953520803741\r\n\r\nWith changes:\r\n\r\nRun | Fixed Cost | Per Element\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nRun 1 | 5.128020217259724 |

in this set of changes: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10291/files#diff-adf22e1eb39b451e73d4541052a33686R740-R811\r\n\r\nEverything else should follow from that.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

tests will be part of `beam_PostCommit_PortableJar_Flink`. Kind of misleading, since as of #10270, portable jars will not actually be used in these tests (they would be expected to fail because of BEAM-8835) but we can use these tests to verify a fix when we have one.\r\n\r\nNote that we already have `portableWordCountFlinkRunner` tests, but those start an embedded Flink cluster so they couldn't test `FlinkUberJarJobServer`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Changed Beam Python SDK’s pipeline transform apply() logic to\r\nimplicitly alter the label of top-level transform to be applied with\r\nipython-prompt metadata when the code execution is in ipython and during\r\nuser-defined pipeline construction time.\r\n2. The users can observe what pieces of code are in-effect by looking at\r\nthe labels of applied PTransforms. Thus they can avoid broken in-memory\r\nstates due to notebook cell-re-execution/cell-deletion/hidden-states.\r\n3. Allow duplicate PTransform labels in different cells when the user\r\nconstructs a pipeline under an ipython/notebook environment because the\r\nlabel altering de-duplicates the labels.\r\n4. Created common testing package and modules: Created a mock ipython\r\nkernel for testing; Made pipeline assertion a common testing module.\r\n5. Updated tests for ipython related scenarios in a mocked ipython\r\nenvironment.\r\n6. Updated the example notebook.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

we found out, increasing Python 3.7 postcommit timeout does not help to reduce the test flakiness, but instead will further increase overall suite latency, since Jenkins slots will be blocked for a longer period of time, but the suite will still fail.

resolves a longstanding TODO around errors when writing data to a runner. \r\n1. This adds handling for failing stream Sends per https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#ClientConn.NewStream which was only discovered by looking at all the generated GRPC code.\r\nIn particular, this documentation clarifies that when Send fails with an io.EOF, the caller must drain Recv until a non-nil error occurs, which further causes stream resource cleanup on the SDK side. This surfaces the \"root\" error for why the write failed.\r\n2. This (along with previous similar fixes) promotes errors to bundle failures, which should be a sufficient signal to the runner to terminate attention to Sends from the SDK, allowing runner side resources to be cleaned up.\r\n3. This fixes previously broken cases where the now-broken DataChannel wasn't being cleaned up. That is, the data manager would persist in using the broken channel as directed by the runner, but that particular stream was broken. If a channel is broken, it now returns errors for why, which should cause users to clean up, but further, the DataManager is now able to re-use that stream id for a new DataChannel for subsequent bundles.\r\n4. Allow the writer to cancel the reader goroutine incase the reader is blocked in GRPC's receive, via the context. \r\n5. Unit tests for the above.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds functionality to the PipelineInstrument class to create a background caching pipeline. This means that it will modify the original pipeline by writing to cache from each unbounded source, then cutting off all other transforms and PCollections from the graph. This leaves a single pipeline that reads from the unbounded sources and writes all the elements to the cache.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a potential OOM when very narrow row mutations are added (ie\r\n<5 cells, <100 bytes).\r\n\r\nThe overhead of storing a mutation is significant, so with the default\r\ngrouping of 5000*1000 cells, potentially many millions of mutated rows\r\ncan be stored in memory during the grouping phase, leading to an OOM.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a 3rd limit to the grouping by number of mutated rows per batch - default 500 (which corresponds to 500K rows in the grouping stage).\r\n\r\n@chamikaramj \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

more than one ExternalTransform within the same pipeline causes a unique name clash.\r\n\r\nFor a minimal reproducable example:\r\n\r\nStart ExpansionService/JobService:\r\n```bash\r\n./gradlew -p runners/flink/1.8/job-server runShadow\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun a simple pipeljne:\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import print_function\r\n\r\nimport apache_beam as beam\r\nfrom apache_beam.io.external.generate_sequence import GenerateSequence\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main(options):\r\n  pipe = beam.Pipeline(options=options)\r\n\r\n  p1 = (\r\n    pipe\r\n    | 'P1' >>

)\r\n\r\n  (p1, p2) | beam.Flatten() | beam.Map(print)\r\n\r\n  # print(pipe.to_runner_api())\r\n  result = pipe.run()\r\n  result.wait_until_finish()\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n  import argparse\r\n  from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions\r\n  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\r\n  _, pipeline_args = parser.parse_known_args()\r\n  main(PipelineOptions(pipeline_args))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in this error in the expansion service / job service:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO org.apache.beam.runners.core.construction.expansion.ExpansionService - Expanding 'root' with URN 'beam:external:java:generate_sequence:v1'\r\nINFO org.apache.beam.runners.core.construction.expansion.ExpansionService - Expanding 'root' with URN 'beam:external:java:generate_sequence:v1'\r\nWARN

\"root/Read(BoundedCountingSource)/Reshuffle.ViaRandomKey/Values/Values/Map/ParMultiDo(Anonymous).output\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change changes the expansion service log to:\r\n```\r\nINFO org.apache.beam.runners.core.construction.expansion.ExpansionService - Expanding 'P1' with URN 'beam:external:java:generate_sequence:v1'\r\nINFO org.apache.beam.runners.core.construction.expansion.ExpansionService - Expanding 'P2' with URN 'beam:external:java:generate_sequence:v1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change did fix my issue, however I think there may need to be some further adjustments within the `to_runner_api_transform` which appears to strip the `_EXPANDED_TRANSFORM_UNIQUE_NAME` from the transform unique_name.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
