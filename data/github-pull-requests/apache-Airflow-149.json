initial count of task finished state to zero. This enables acquiring the rate from zero to one (particularly useful if you want to alert on task failures).\r\n\r\nWe're using the Prometheus statsd-exporter. Since counters are usually used with a PromQL function like `rate`, it's important\r\nthat counters are initialized at zero, otherwise when a task finishes the rate function will not have a previous value to compare the state count to.\r\n\r\nFor example, what we'd like to do, which tells us the failure rate of tasks over time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsum by (dag_id, task_id) (rate(airflow_ti_finish{state='failed'}[1h])) > 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo useful posts on this

The problem is that our time conversion doesn't work correctly. I will try to describe it below. On server side we create a logs in UTC time. After that on UI JavaScript takes this logs and for each timestamps changes UTC flag to flag which is indicated like serverTimezone. But without time conversion, for example for PDT timezone: 2022-04-13 12:15:00,117+00:00 time in log file, on UI will be changed to 2022-04-13 12:15:00,117−07:00 time. Then another JS code using a correct convert function converts this timestamp to a time with a serverTimezone and in result we will see 2022-04-13, 12:15:00 PDT. How you see now we have UTC time with PDT label and each next conversion will create an incorrect time view.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Wojciech Januszek [januszek@google.com](mailto:januszek@google.com)\r\nCo-authored-by: Lukasz Wyszomirski [wyszomirski@google.com](mailto:wyszomirski@google.com)\r\nCo-authored-by: Maksim Yermakou [maksimy@google.com](mailto:maksimy@google.com)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/UPDATING.md).\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-19T09:58:32Z","updated_at":"2022-04-25T21:44:29Z","closed_at":"2022-04-21T15:33:19Z","merged_at":"2022-04-21T15:33:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"e57c7aeda8c5cd9d0f10e2ce46a155ea01181140","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

#23042\r\n\r\nThe padding in the graph view is applied to the node and not the edge. Therefore an edge that goes above the highest node, can be cut off. Also, the autorefresh buttons creates a hidden cutoff where `overflow: hidden` style is being applied.\r\n\r\nThis fix increases the padding, makes the refresh actions absolutely positioned to prevent it from cutting off the screen, moves around which elements allow overflow or not, and then apply a transparent background to the refresh actions to make  any overlap less jarring.\r\n\r\n![graph overflow demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4600967/163586211-977db726-5bed-4ad6-9fa4-cd364b1c0b59.gif)\r\n\r\nThis moves a lot right now, so I want to make sure it works for all DAGs so we will merge this _after_ 2.3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/UPDATING.md).\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-15T14:58:44Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T06:08:51Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T19:47:24Z","merged_at":"2022-05-12T19:47:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"028087b5a6e94fd98542d0e681d947979eb1011f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

level permissions are not checked properly if a post request is sent from within the web ui (i.e. clear a task or dag run). If a user has can_read on any dag any operation that involves a post request is allowed even though the user does not have the can_write permission for this dag as far as the appropriate other permissions like edit_task_instance or edit_dag_run were granted. This is caused by the dag_id being extracted from `request.args` which only exists for get requests (i.e. change the status of a task). Otherwise `None` is used as dag_id in `appbuilder.sm.check_authorization` which essentially leads to ignoring the dag level access permissions.\r\n\r\nI added two new tests for this specific issue.\r\nWhile writing the tests I fixed a small issue in another test (`test_success_fail_for_read_only_task_instance_access`) that resulted in the test succeeding although not for the reason that is under test here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow up to #21797 as discussed there and addresses the first issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last let me thank you all again for your great

Airflow displays provider's Doc URLs it builds the\r\nURL to documentation for community providers but for third party\r\nproviders it was wrong.\r\n\r\nWith this change:\r\n* if provider already has Documentation standard Project-URL\r\n  metadata, Airflow will use it\r\n* if provider is an \"apache-airflow\" one, it will dynamically\r\n  build the URL from provider info\r\n* if neither of two is

bug was introduced in #22941 that when a DAG is last run before upgrading to Airflow 2.2, the calendar view would fail with an error because that last run does not contain data interval information.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by simply not showing planned runs if the last run was made with data interval information. Technically we could still infer planned runs in this situation, but since it only affects the DAG temporarily and will \"fix\" itself after that DAG is run one time against 2.2 anyway, that's probably not worth it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22111\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the google-ads dependency to v15.1.1, which adds support for v10 of the Google Ads API.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the Google Ads API supported by the current library is v8, which will be sunsetted on 2022-05-11 (https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/sunset-dates).\r\n\r\nPreviously, Airflow was limited to v14.0.0 of the library as more recent versions required v2.x of google-api-core. However, the google-ads library re-added support for v1.x of google-api-core in v15.1.1\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis is my first Airflow PR - I tried to run the full Breeze test suite, but struggled as the new requirements conflict with the constraints files - any advice would be welcome!\r\n\r\nHowever, I did build an image & run a few DAGs / operators that I run regularly, getting the expected result\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-12T22:28:12Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T09:09:46Z","closed_at":"2022-04-15T10:20:39Z","merged_at":"2022-04-15T10:20:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"c36bcc4c06c93dce11e2306a4aff66432bffd5a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google
