What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add a sort operation to make the contents of `SERDEPROPERTIES` in the result of `ShowCreateTableAsSerdeCommand` have a fixed

command with Java 19:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests -pl sql/hive -am  \r\nmvn test -pl sql/hive -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.command.ShowCreateTableSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 failed test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- SHOW CREATE TABLE using Hive V1 catalog V1 command: hive table

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new error sub-classes of the error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH`, and use it in the case of type check failures of some interval expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMigration onto error classes unifies Spark SQL error messages, and improves search-ability of errors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The PR changes user-facing error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AnalysisSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ExpressionTypeCheckingSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake HeartbeatReceiver as an IsolatedRpcEndpoint then it has dedicated single thread to process heartbeats.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll RpcEndpoint including HeartbeatReceiver in driver are sharing one thread pool. When there're lots of rpc messages queued, the waiting process time of heartbeat time could easily exceed heartbeat timeout, which generates lots of false positive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually

**What changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\n\r\nAdd a clear warning in spark SQL so that users are aware that a decimal containing an exponent will be converted to double, which may lead to a loss of precision.\r\n\r\nThe warning message: `In Spark 3.0, numbers written in scientific notation would be parsed as Double. To restore the behavior before Spark 3.0, you can set spark.sql.legacy.exponentLiteralAsDecimal.enabled to true.`\r\n\r\nFor example, when we want to insert `8.8888888888888888888e9` to a `DECIMAL(20,10)` column of a table, we will be able to see the following warning:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE t(c0 DECIMAL(20,10));\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO t VALUES (8.8888888888888888888e9);\r\n22/10/07 15:36:04 WARN SparkSqlAstBuilder: In Spark 3.0, numbers written in scientific notation would be parsed as Double. To restore the behavior before Spark 3.0, you can set spark.sql.legacy.exponentLiteralAsDecimal.enabled to true.\r\nspark-sql> select * from t;\r\n8888888888.8888900000\r\n```\r\nThe warning will not show up for DECIMAL values without exponent.\r\n\r\n### **Why are the changes needed?**\r\n\r\nUsers may not be aware that numbers written in scientific notation (for example, `1E2`) would be parsed as Double during insertion. Adding a warning to let them be aware of potential precision loss and options of setting one configuration to restore the behavior before Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### **Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a warning.\r\n\r\n### **How was this patch tested?**\r\nThere are no new tests added. All existing tests pass. This change was tested by running the Spark SQL shell with decimal values with and without values containing exponent (For example, see \"What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\"). We are happy to also add a unit test if it is necessary.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-13T02:36:13Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T00:19:46Z","closed_at":"2023-01-24T00:19:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebe589117ead2bbf2e50981c30bd489319f38041","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/993eea0b5ecc8fea1468ad71543bda89ba37e4e9","head":{"label":"xsystem2022:SPARK-40616","ref":"SPARK-40616","sha":"993eea0b5ecc8fea1468ad71543bda89ba37e4e9","user":{"login":"xsystem2022","id":115322004,"node_id":"U_kgDOBt-slA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115322004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022","html_url":"https://github.com/xsystem2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":547566178,"node_id":"R_kgDOIKMyYg","name":"spark","full_name":"xsystem2022/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xsystem2022","id":115322004,"node_id":"U_kgDOBt-slA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115322004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022","html_url":"https://github.com/xsystem2022","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xsystem2022/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xsystem2022/spark","description":"Apache

The fix is to insure that the correct `bash` is called, and that arguments passed to `bash` are passed with slashes rather than **slashes.**\r\n\r\n### The build error message:\r\n```bash\r\n ./build.sbt packageBin\r\n```\r\n<pre>\r\n[info] compiling 9 Java sources to C:\\Users\\philwalk\\workspace\\spark\\common\\sketch\\target\\scala-2.12\\classes ...\r\n/bin/bash: C:Usersphilwalkworkspacesparkcore/../build/spark-build-info: No such file or directory\r\n[info] compiling 1 Scala source to C:\\Users\\philwalk\\workspace\\spark\\tools\\target\\scala-2.12\\classes ...\r\n[info] compiling 5 Scala sources to C:\\Users\\philwalk\\workspace\\spark\\mllib-local\\target\\scala-2.12\\classes ...\r\n[info] Compiling 5 protobuf files to C:\\Users\\philwalk\\workspace\\spark\\connector\\connect\\target\\scala-2.12\\src_managed\\main\r\n[error] stack trace is suppressed; run last core / Compile / managedResources for the full output\r\n[error] (core / Compile / managedResources) Nonzero exit value: 127\r\n[error] Total time: 42 s, completed Oct 8, 2022, 4:49:12 PM\r\nsbt:spark-parent>\r\nsbt:spark-parent> last core /Compile /managedResources\r\nlast core /Compile /managedResources\r\n[error] java.lang.RuntimeException: Nonzero exit value: 127\r\n[error]         at scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:30)\r\n[error]         at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImpl$AbstractBuilder.slurp(ProcessBuilderImpl.scala:138)\r\n[error]         at scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilderImpl$AbstractBuilder.$bang$bang(ProcessBuilderImpl.scala:108)\r\n[error]         at Core$.$anonfun$settings$4(SparkBuild.scala:604)\r\n[error]         at scala.Function1.$anonfun$compose$1(Function1.scala:49)\r\n[error]         at sbt.internal.util.$tilde$greater.$anonfun$$u2219$1(TypeFunctions.scala:62)\r\n[error]         at sbt.std.Transform$$anon$4.work(Transform.scala:68)\r\n[error]         at sbt.Execute.$anonfun$submit$2(Execute.scala:282)\r\n[error]         at sbt.internal.util.ErrorHandling$.wideConvert(ErrorHandling.scala:23)\r\n[error]         at sbt.Execute.work(Execute.scala:291)\r\n[error]         at sbt.Execute.$anonfun$submit$1(Execute.scala:282)\r\n[error]         at sbt.ConcurrentRestrictions$$anon$4.$anonfun$submitValid$1(ConcurrentRestrictions.scala:265)\r\n[error]         at sbt.CompletionService$$anon$2.call(CompletionService.scala:64)\r\n[error]         at java.base/java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:264)\r\n[error]         at java.base/java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:515)\r\n[error]         at java.base/java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:264)\r\n[error]         at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1128)\r\n[error]         at java.base/java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:628)\r\n[error]         at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:834)\r\n[error] (core / Compile / managedResources) Nonzero exit value: 127\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n### bash scripts fail when run from `cygwin` or `msys2`\r\nThe other problem fixed by the PR is to address problems preventing the `bash` scripts (`spark-shell`, `spark-submit`, etc.) from being used in Windows `SHELL` environments.   The problem is that the bash version of `spark-class` fails in a Windows shell environment, the result of `launcher/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/launcher/Main.java` not following the convention expected by `spark-class`, and also appending CR to line endings.  The resulting error message not helpful.\r\n\r\nThere are two parts to this fix:\r\n1. modify `Main.java` to treat a `SHELL` session on Windows as a `bash` session\r\n2. remove the appended CR character when parsing the output produced by `Main.java`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThese changes should NOT affect anyone who is not trying build or run bash scripts from a Windows SHELL environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests were performed to verify both changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### related JIRA issues\r\nThe following 2 JIRA issue were created.  Both are fixed by this PR.  They are both linked to this PR.\r\n\r\n- Bug SPARK-40739 \"sbt packageBin\" fails in cygwin or other windows bash session\r\n- Bug SPARK-40738 spark-shell fails with \"bad

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR refactors `checkCorrelationsInSubquery` in CheckAnalysis to use recursion instead of `foreachUp`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the logic in `checkCorrelationsInSubquery` is inefficient and difficult to understand. It uses `foreachUp` to traverse the subquery plan tree, and traverses down an entire subtree of a plan node to check whether it contains any outer references. We can use recursion instead to traverse the plan tree only once to improve the performance and readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.skewedPartitionFactor` to support float values by converging to `doubleConf` from `intConf`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike `spark.sql.adaptive.rebalancePartitionsSmallPartitionFactor`, this allows users to use the configuration more flexibly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but it will accept all previous Integer configuration values.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the changed default value,

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis avoids a int overflow in calculating estimated total size for a broadcast. The wrong value is only used in a log message but the wrong size being logged can be confusing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current log message will be incorrect for broadcast exceeding 2GiB.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nI fixes the log message for broadcast > 2GiB in size.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests. Does spark have some way to test logging? \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-12T14:57:37Z","updated_at":"2022-10-15T13:24:12Z","closed_at":"2022-10-15T13:24:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e78e84c0de1571fe07692d1d0c255cbeb11f103","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4026fef06a4e9122854a185314798d575fbeee33","head":{"label":"eejbyfeldt:SPARK-40771","ref":"SPARK-40771","sha":"4026fef06a4e9122854a185314798d575fbeee33","user":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373800628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzM4MDA2Mjg=","name":"spark","full_name":"eejbyfeldt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eejbyfeldt","id":73838248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczODM4MjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73838248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt","html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eejbyfeldt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eejbyfeldt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove the error messages when a Python method provided to `DataFrame.groupby(...).applyInPandas` / `DataFrame.groupby(...).cogroup(...).applyInPandas` returns a Pandas DataFrame that does not match the expected schema.\r\n\r\nWith\r\n```Python\r\ngdf = spark.range(2).join(spark.range(3).withColumnRenamed(\"id\", \"val\")).groupby(\"id\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching column names, matching number of columns:**\r\n```Python\r\ngdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf.rename(columns={\"val\": \"v\"}), \"id long, val long\").show()\r\n# was: KeyError: 'val'\r\n# now: RuntimeError: Column names of the returned pandas.DataFrame do not match specified schema.\r\n#      Missing: val  Unexpected: v\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching column names, different number of columns:**\r\n```Python\r\ngdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf.assign(foo=[3, 3, 3]).rename(columns={\"val\": \"v\"}), \"id long, val long\").show()\r\n# was: RuntimeError: Number of columns of the returned pandas.DataFrame doesn't match specified schema.\r\n#      Expected: 2 Actual: 3\r\n# now: RuntimeError: Column names of the returned pandas.DataFrame do not match specified schema.\r\n#      Missing: val  Unexpected: foo, v\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected schema matches but has duplicates (`id`) so that number of columns match:**\r\n```Python\r\ngdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf.rename(columns={\"val\": \"v\"}), \"id long, id long\").show()\r\n# was: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: not all nodes and buffers were consumed.\r\n#      nodes: [ArrowFieldNode [length=3, nullCount=0]]\r\n#      buffers: [ArrowBuf[304], address:139860828549160, length:0, ArrowBuf[305], address:139860828549160, length:24]\r\n# now: RuntimeError: Column names of the returned pandas.DataFrame do not match specified schema.\r\n#      Unexpected: v \r\n```\r\n\r\n**In case the returned Pandas DataFrame contains no column names (none of the column labels is a string):**\r\n```Python\r\ngdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf.assign(foo=[3, 3, 3]).rename(columns={\"id\": 0, \"val\": 1, \"foo\": 2}), \"id long, val long\").show()\r\n# was: RuntimeError: Number of columns of the returned pandas.DataFrame doesn't match specified schema.\r\n#      Expected: 2 Actual: 3\r\n# now: RuntimeError: Number of columns of the returned pandas.DataFrame doesn't match specified schema.\r\n#      Expected: 2  Actual: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching types (ValueError and TypeError):**\r\n```Python\r\ngdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf, \"id int, val string\").show()\r\n# was: pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Expected a string or bytes dtype, got int64\r\n# now: pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Expected a string or bytes dtype, got int64\r\n#      The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n#      TypeError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (int64) with name 'val' to Arrow Array (string).\r\n\r\n\r\ngdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf.assign(val=pdf[\"val\"].apply(str)), \"id int, val double\").show()\r\n# was: pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '0' with type str: tried to convert to double\r\n# now: pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '0' with type str: tried to convert to double\r\n#      The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n#      ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) with name 'val' to Arrow Array (double).\r\n\r\nwith self.sql_conf({\"spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely\": True}):\r\n  gdf.applyInPandas(lambda pdf: pdf.assign(val=pdf[\"val\"].apply(str)), \"id int, val double\").show()\r\n# was: ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) to Arrow Array (double).\r\n#      It can be caused by overflows or other unsafe conversions warned by Arrow. Arrow safe type check can be disabled\r\n#      by using SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely`.\r\n# now: ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) with name 'val' to Arrow Array (double).\r\n#      It can be caused by overflows or other unsafe conversions warned by Arrow. Arrow safe type check can be disabled\r\n#      by using SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExisting errors are generic (`KeyError`) or meaningless (`not all nodes and buffers were consumed`). The errors should help users in spotting the mismatching columns by naming them.\r\n\r\nThe schema of the returned Pandas DataFrames can only be checked during processing the DataFrame, so such errors are very expensive. Therefore, they should be expressive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis only changes error messages, not behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests all cases of schema mismatch for `GroupedData.applyInPandas` and `PandasCogroupedOps.applyInPandas`.","created_at":"2022-10-12T14:37:23Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T13:58:04Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T00:52:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5397ac00d449c63c51e8aa2e6c5ffe52703f6ccc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df27aa710bda6cf258fc8ad9fa1efe536e128a7e","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-pyspark-apply-in-pandas-schema-mismatch","ref":"branch-pyspark-apply-in-pandas-schema-mismatch","sha":"df27aa710bda6cf258fc8ad9fa1efe536e128a7e","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis RP makes the Row-level Runtime Filtering work without stats.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAt present, Row-level Runtime Filtering will judge whether maxScanSize meets the requirements for performing Row-level Runtime Filtering. When there is no stats in the catalogTable, maxScanSize is equal to 0, which makes it unable to meet the requirements for performing Row-level Runtime Filtering, resulting in Row-level Runtime Filtering not being enabled. By adding the RUNTIME_FILTER__ENABLED_WHEN_NO_STATS parameter, when RUNTIME_FILTER__ENABLED_WHEN_NO_STATS is true, even if maxScanSize is equal to 0 but other conditions can satisfy Row-level Runtime Filtering will still be executed. Avoid Row-level Runtime Filtering not enabled because catalogTable has no stats.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-12T03:57:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T02:33:31Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T09:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ee5ec701b6b838f78314b8ada189e18b65e848d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f0cbbe92bc5718580f52f84f17769af2408fb857","head":{"label":"chenminghua8:chenminghua8-patch-1","ref":"chenminghua8-patch-1","sha":"f0cbbe92bc5718580f52f84f17769af2408fb857","user":{"login":"chenminghua8","id":50258628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjU4NjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50258628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8","html_url":"https://github.com/chenminghua8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":524928275,"node_id":"R_kgDOH0nFEw","name":"spark","full_name":"chenminghua8/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenminghua8","id":50258628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjU4NjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50258628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8","html_url":"https://github.com/chenminghua8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenminghua8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenminghua8/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267, #35357 and #36889.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDelete the directory that has been created in advance in the test case. Add the judgment of whether the directory exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe implementation class of ExternalCatalog will perform folder operations when performing operations such as create/drop database/table/partition. The test case creates a folder in advance when obtaining the DB/Partition path URI, in unit tests the external catalog does not actually create files, resulting in the result of the test case is not convincing enough force.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR pulls out the `getDriverLogUrls` from `StandaloneSchedulerBackend` to superclass `SchedulerBackend`, to make it support setting driver log url by env vars w/ prefix `SPARK_DRIVER_LOG_URL_` on other resource managers, especially for K8s.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince it has such an ability for the executor on K8s mode, we want to align the ability for the driver.\r\n\r\nThe related code in `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend`\r\n```\r\n  def extractLogUrls: Map[String, String] = {\r\n    val prefix = \"SPARK_LOG_URL_\"\r\n    sys.env.filterKeys(_.startsWith(prefix))\r\n      .map(e => (e._1.substring(prefix.length).toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT), e._2)).toMap\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the user could set the log urls by env vars.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT, if it's not sufficient and the approach is accepted, will add more ut later.\r\n\r\nAnd MT in local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use `checkError()` to check the error class, message parameters and the query context. After the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37916, all parsing exceptions should have an error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Checking of the error classes plus the query context improves the test coverage.\r\n2. Eliminating the dependency of error messages. So, tech editors will be able to modify `error-classes.json` w/o fixing the test suite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ErrorParserSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-10-11T08:51:00Z","updated_at":"2022-10-12T14:00:07Z","closed_at":"2022-10-12T14:00:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27d41ff20dd9fcbc4e79cdbe905834c5513a4835","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38204/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38204/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38204/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51309ab2c3e40086f3201aa778f4f4298a0d25d2","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:intercept-parsing-error-class","ref":"intercept-parsing-error-class","sha":"51309ab2c3e40086f3201aa778f4f4298a0d25d2","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\n\r\nIn elastic resource scheduling (such as k8s), the executor will be quickly recycled. We will use the Remote shuffle service to solve the problem of shuffle data loss, but when spark.shuffle.service.enabled is set to true, BlockManager will register with ExternalShuffle , because the executor has been recycled, the registration will fail, which seriously interferes with the use of the Remote shuffle service. This change ignores the registration of ExternalShuffle when using the Remote shuffle service.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Why are the changes needed?**\r\nLet the Remote shuffle service work properly.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nRun all unit tests and pass, Remote shuffle service test case:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a performance regression issue when one side of a join uses `HashPartitioning` with `ShuffleExchange` while the other side uses `SinglePartition`. In this case, Spark will re-shuffle the side with `HashPartitioning` and both sides will end up with only a single partition. This could hurt query performance a lot if the side with `HashPartitioning` contains a lot of input data.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-35703, when Spark sees that one side of the join has `ShuffleExchange` (meaning it needs to be shuffled anyways), and the other side doesn't, it'll try to avoid shuffling the side without `ShuffleExchange`. For instance:\r\n\r\n```\r\nShuffleExchange(HashPartition(200)) <-> HashPartition(150)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be converted into\r\n```\r\nShuffleExchange(HashPartition(150)) <-> HashPartition(150)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when the side without `ShuffleExchange` is `SinglePartition`, like the following:\r\n```\r\nShuffleExchange(HashPartition(150)) <-> SinglePartition\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will also do the same which causes the left-hand side to only use one partition. This can hurt job parallelism dramatically, especially when using DataSource V2, since `SinglePartition` is used by the V2 scan. On the other hand, it seems DataSource V1 won't be impacted much as it always report `UnknownPartitioning` in this situation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR cleans up the logic of `listFunctions`. Currently `listFunctions` gets all external functions and registered functions (built-in, temporary, and persistent functions with a specific database name).  It is not necessary to get persistent functions that match a specific database name again since`externalCatalog.listFunctions` already fetched them. We only need to list all built-in and temporary functions from the function registries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCode clean up.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRefactor proto from `Read` to `UnresolvedRelation`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnresolvedRelation has its own proto. In the future we will add a proto for DataSource. We can decouple these two plans in connect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds basic support for writes through the Spark Connect API. In todays implementation of the write API from a DataFrame perspective the interface of the DataFrameWriter is as declarative as possible today. \r\n\r\nThe write support is implemented as a `Command` and does not return anything.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWrite support through Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nExperimental API\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests for the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr add `-Djdk.reflect.useDirectMethodHandle=false` to `JavaModuleOptions ` and `maven/sbt` `extraJavaTestArgs` to make  Spark use `UnsafeFieldAccessor` as default  with Java 18/19 to avoid the bad case described in SPARK-40729 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter  [JEP 416: Reimplement Core Reflection with Method Handles](https://openjdk.org/jeps/416),  `MethodHandleAccessor 'is the default reflection implementation of Java, but in Spark it will cause the bad case mentioned in SPARK-40729,  so add `-Djdk.reflect.useDirectMethodHandle=false` as a workaround for Java 18/19. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, The new option will not affect Java versions below 18\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual test:\r\n\r\n1.  run `repl` module test with Java 18/19\r\n\r\n**Before** \r\n\r\n```\r\n- broadcast vars ***

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, if the creation side of bloom filter could be broadcasted, Spark doesn't inject a bloom filter or `InSunquery` filter into the application side. I think at first we thought broadcast was cheaper than runtime filter. This behavior is contrary to the join has a shuffle below broadcast hash join described in the design document.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/194822331-7a36b018-dfd9-48ce-a867-7c30a6914791.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, although we use broadcast join and improves the performance, compared with the reduction of data volume, it is still worse if the application side have many rows. So, we just need the creation side is small enough.\r\n\r\nAs we know, bloom filter ensures creation side is small enough with the code below.\r\n```\r\n    // Skip if the filter creation side is too big\r\n    if (filterCreationSidePlan.stats.sizeInBytes > conf.runtimeFilterCreationSideThreshold) {\r\n      return filterApplicationSidePlan\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n`InSunquery` filter ensures creation side is small enough with the code below.\r\n```\r\n    val aggregate = Aggregate(Seq(alias), Seq(alias), filterCreationSidePlan)\r\n    if (!canBroadcastBySize(aggregate, conf)) {\r\n      // Skip the InSubquery filter if the size of `aggregate` is beyond broadcast join threshold,\r\n      // i.e., the semi-join will be a shuffled join, which is not worthwhile.\r\n      return filterApplicationSidePlan\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Query Performance Benchmarks: TPC-DS Performance Evaluation**\r\nHere are the test cases this PR can trigger the runtime filter.\r\nTest machine: 144

`ADAPTIVE_MAX_SHUFFLE_HASH_JOIN_LOCAL_MAP_THRESHOLD`\r\nbut `ADVISORY_PARTITION_SIZE_IN_BYTES` is 64MB by default, so we can not add `SHUFFLE_HASH` hint for the plan which all partitions size are less than `ADVISORY_PARTITION_SIZE_IN_BYTES`.\r\n\r\nThe new preferring shuffled hash join condition:\r\n\r\n* Try to coalesce the join, thinking the side satisfies Shuffled Hash Join condition if all the coalesced partitions are less than `ADAPTIVE_MAX_SHUFFLE_HASH_JOIN_LOCAL_MAP_THRESHOLD`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nChange more join to shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\n### Does this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI think `join`'s `on` input can be `bool` or `List[bool]` type. For example, the demo in the comment is a valid demo:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/309638eeefbfb13dae8dbded0279bf44390389ee/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py#L2107-L2108\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI originally got this typing error in my IDE:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"842\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3375461/194736048-cafeb431-6365-4d3b-a18d-c5635373e63c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe command joins two table successfully on different columns, however, the typing definition is wrong I think.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, I am using `pyspark==3.3.0`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter adding `bool` and `List[bool]`, the typing error is

though `cygwin bash` appears earlier in the `PATH`.  In addition, file path arguments to bash contain backslashes.    The fix is to insure that the correct `bash` is called, and that arguments passed to `bash` are passed with slashes rather than **slashes.**\r\n\r\nThe other problem fixed by the PR is to address problems preventing the `bash` scripts (`spark-shell`, `spark-submit`, etc.) from being used in Windows `SHELL` environments.   The problem is that the bash version of `spark-class` fails in a Windows shell environment, the result of `launcher/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/launcher/Main.java` not following the convention expected by `spark-class`, and also appending CR to line endings.  The resulting error message not helpful.\r\n\r\nThere are two parts to this fix:\r\n1. modify `Main.java` to treat a `SHELL` session on Windows as a `bash` session\r\n2. remove the appended CR character when parsing the output produced by `Main.java`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThese changes should NOT affect anyone who is not trying build or run bash scripts from a Windows SHELL environment.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to actively unset the `SHELL` variable inside of `spark-class.cmd`, to avoid this corner case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove `PartitionAlreadyExistsException` and use `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` instead of it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To simplify user apps. After the changes, users don't need to catch both exceptions `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` as well as `PartitionAlreadyExistsException `.\r\n2. To improve code maintenance since don't need to support almost the same code.\r\n3. To avoid errors like the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38152 fixed `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` but not `PartitionAlreadyExistsException`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nShuffledHashJoin releases the built hashed relation at the end of task using taskCompletionListener. It is not always good enough for complex sql query.\r\n\r\nIf a smj or window on the top of the shj without a shuffle, then the hashed relation in shj would be leak. All rows have been consumed in sort before smj or window then the buffer can not allocate the memory which is hold by hashed relation. Then it causes unnecessary spill.\r\n\r\nIt is a common case in multi-join, since AQE supports convert smj to shj at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis pr cleanup resource for two cases:\r\n1. after building hashed relation, cleanup build plan\r\n2. after inserting rows in sort, cleanup child\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEagerly release hashed relation to avoid unnecessary spill in other memory consumers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI encountered an issue using Spark while reading JSON files based on a schema it throws every time an exception related to conversion of types.\r\n\r\n>Note: This issue can be reproduced only with Scala `2.13`, I'm not having this issue with `2.12`\r\n\r\n````\r\nFailed to convert value ArraySeq(1, 2, 3) (class of class scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq$ofRef}) with the type of ArrayType(StringType,true) to JSON.\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to convert value ArraySeq(1, 2, 3) (class of class scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq$ofRef}) with the type of ArrayType(StringType,true) to JSON.\r\n````\r\n\r\nIf I add ArraySeq to the matching cases, the test that I added passed successfully

error\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28459763/194669654-19cefb13-180c-48ac-9206-69d8f672f64c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf the person is using Scala 2.13, they can't parse an array. Which means they need to fallback to 2.12 to keep the project functioning \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a sample unit test for the case, but I can add more if you want

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change formatting of partition specs in `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`. For instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (id=1) LOCATION 'loc' PARTITION (id=2) LOCATION 'loc1';\r\nThe following partitions already exists in table t:2 -> id\r\n```\r\nAfter the changes, the error message looks:\r\n```sql\r\nThe following partitions already exists in table t:id -> 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be consistent w/ V1 catalogs, and to not confuse Spark SQL users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current char/varchar feature relies on the data source to take care of all the write paths and ensure the char/varchar semantic (length check, string padding). This is good for the read performance, but has problems if some write paths did not follow the char/varchar semantic. e.g. a parquet table can be written by old Spark versions that do not have char/varchar type, or by other systems that do not recognize Spark char/varchar type.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds read-side string padding for the char type, so that we can still guarantee the char type semantic if the underlying data is valid (not over length). Char type is rarely used for legacy reasons and the perf doesn't matter that much, correctness is more important here. People can still disable read-side padding via a config if they are sure the data was written properly, such as benchmarks.\r\n\r\nNote, we don't add read-side length check as varchar type is widely used and we don't want to introduce perf regression for the common case. Another reason is it's better to avoid invalid data at the write side, and read-side check won't help much.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto better enforce char type semantic\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now Spark can still return padding char type values correctly even if the data source writer wrote the char type value without padding.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated
