datasets to the dag dependencies view.\r\n\r\nMay want to reduce round trips to DB to look up dataset ID somehow.  (i may work on this tomorrow)\r\n\r\nIn future, if we can add optional `name` to dataset, better to use that for node labels.\r\n\r\nAs part of this I also remove the \"dependency detector\" as a configurable thing.  I'll call a vote by lazy consensus for this.\r\n\r\nI really don't think something so small as determining the graph behavior in one view warrants pluggability in this way, and it just makes it harder to make changes.

in order to keep consistent development environment\r\nwe've compiled javascript in the CI image. However we can utilise\r\npower of pre-commmit for setting the node environment for all\r\ncontributors automatically. Instead of compiling the javascript\r\nin the image, we can compile it via pre-commit in the host.\r\n\r\nThis can be done thanks to the new python breeze which is far more\r\nflexible and can now add execution of compilation of the javascript when\r\nneeded and using pre-commit environments.\r\n\r\nThanks to that, we can vastly simplify the Dockerfiles and scripts that\r\nare used to automatically build or signal that the assets need\r\nrecompilation. We can basically assume that the assets were prepared\r\noutside of the image building (and breeze makes sure it happens)\r\n\r\nThe changes:\r\n\r\n* node.js is not needed in images (neither PROD build nor CI)\r\n* no need for multiple asset compilation scripts. All is done\r\n  via pre-commit environment with `breeze compile-www-assets``\r\n  command\r\n* lint checks for UI do not need the docker image any more\r\n  (they are also based on pre-commit environment)\r\n* no more checks/warnings when you enter the image\r\n* start-airflow command builds the compilation before entering\r\n* prepare-airflow-package runs asset compilation before entering\r\n  docker airflow building.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Problem\r\n\r\nWhen SLAs are enabled, DAG processing can grind to a halt. this manifests as updates to dag files being ignored: newly added dags do not appear, and changes to existing dags do not take effect.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour will be seemingly random - some dags will update, others not. The reason is because internally the DagProcessorManager maintains a queue of dags to parse and update. Dags get into this queue by a couple of mechanisms. The first and obvious one is the scanning of the file system for dag files.\r\n\r\nHowever, dags can also get into this queue during evaluation of the dag's state by the scheduler (`scheduler_job.py`). Since these event-based callbacks presumably require more rapid reaction than a regular scan of the file system, they go to the front of the queue.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how SLAs break the system; prior to this MR they are treated the same as other callbacks, i.e. they cause their file to go to the front of the queue. The problem is that SLAs are evaluated per dag file, but a single dag may have many tasks with SLAs. Thus the evaluation of a single DAG may generate _many_ SLA callbacks.\r\n\r\nThese cause the affected file to go to the front of the queue. It's re-evaluated, and then the SLA events are fired again.\r\n\r\nWhat this means in practice is that you will see the DagProcessorManager process a dag file with SLAs, move onto the next file in the queue, maybe even make it to 2 or 3 more dags ... and then more SLAs callbacks arrive from the first dag and reset the queue. The DagProcessorManager never makes it all the way to the end of its queue.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nIt's pretty simple: the DagProcessorManager queue is altered s.t. SLA callbacks are only added if they don't already exist (remember they're processed per-dag, but generated one per task-with-SLA), and when added they do not change the place of the dag file in the queue. If it's not in the queue, it's added at the back.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nThis may feel a bit sticky-tape-and-string; you could argue that the SLACallbacks shouldn't be generated so rapidly. However, the only thing that knows the state of the queue is the DagProcessorManager, and it's unreasonable to expect the DagProcessors to throttle themselves without knowing whether such throttling is necessary.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, more optimisations in the DagProcessors are possible, but having the queue gate the callbacks as they're added is necessary and sufficient to stop the SLAs spamming the queue.\r\n\r\nThis change should fix the problems initially reported in #15596 (although note that since that request was first reported, subsequent changes have altered _how_ the failure manifests - the DagProcessorManager no longer times out, it simply keeps processing the same few dags over and over).\r\n\r\n### Works on my machine (TM)\r\n\r\nObviously I found this problem because it was manifesting in my local install of airflow. I've patched my install with an equivalent change, and it's fixed the issue.","created_at":"2022-07-19T08:02:28Z","updated_at":"2022-08-14T09:45:40Z","closed_at":"2022-07-21T21:03:20Z","merged_at":"2022-07-21T21:03:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"17ec6dbcfe4a4d60092644e1b373d80789802b49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

want to use them in some `@task` signature improvements. Mypy added this in 0.950, but let's just bump to latest since why not.\r\n\r\nChangelog of typing-extensions is spotty before 4.0, but ParamSpec was introduced some time before that (likely some time in 2021), and it seems to be a reasonble minimum to bump to.\r\n\r\nSee [PEP 612](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) for more about ParamSpec if you’re interested. But in short, it solves our problem when typing `@task`—the resulting task should accept the same arguments as the wrapped function inside, but when called should return an XComArg, instead of the

the operator unit tests, including type hinting, variable name conventions, string quote style, etc \r\n- Adds explicit unit testing for the integer_fields before making any changes to how they are handled.\r\n\r\n[b94fdb4](]https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/b94fdb4dd49a012a70161be98616bd2080189f64)\r\n- Refactors the operator's integer_fields so they are configured at runtime.  This is a requirement for the system tests in a future PR to run.  The unit tests added in `1a9d278` all still pass, showing that the changes do not break existing

Later we can put something about deps fulfillment information there.\r\n\r\nNote to self / @bbovenzi / @jedcunningham.... it occurs to me that we may have some capability of providing an _estimated_ next run time, based on when we think the upstream datasets will be updated (based on when the tasks that update them are estimated to run).\r\n\r\nThis is a quick and easy improvement.  In subsequent PR will work on getting information about dataset deps fulfillment.\r\n\r\nWe might want to rename the attrs on the dag model to be more general.
