Same when a string is returned for `data` by the pagination function. This is because the `_merge_next_page_parameters` was not handling the case where data is a string.\r\n\r\nThus, this PR:\r\n- Fix the string issue. <br>→ Now, during the merge, if any of the data parameter is a string, the new one simply override the initial one\r\n- Change the typing of the class to `dict | str | None` instead of `Any` <br>→ To be consistent with the HttpHook and the HttpTrigger\r\n- Get a more detailed docstring for the pagination\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull

PR improves the mechanism for getting credentials to authenticate to the EKS pod by wrapping the `eks_get_token.py` script and printing the credentials out to `stdout`, without having to interact with

building hte image, breeze converts some simple parameters passed as breeze command (with autocompletion and explanation) into much longer and more complex set of build args that are passed to `docker build` command. The way how passing hte args worked so far is that it was pretty implicit:\r\n\r\n* **kwargs were used to ingest `click` flags\r\n* parameters found as empty/None were filtered out from these\r\n* Build*Params dataclass was created out of such kwargs dict\r\n* argumenst from dataclass (with some customization) were converted to --build-arg (CAPITALIZED_PROPERTY_NAME)\r\n\r\nThis had a lot of implicitness and it was not easy to understand whether the parameters passed were correct and how they passed through this chain.\r\n\r\nThis change makes all the build arg much more explicit - without kwargs and dictionary. Each CI/PROD build param has now a method where it explicitly converts arguments into build-args - including specifying which of those are optional (where you can actually filter out Empty and None values) and which are required (where an actual value is expected).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Which is the airflow sidecar container not exiting gracefully even after the \"base\" container completes or exits. \r\n\r\n~~To get this working, I was able to do a POC by making airflow kerberos container and airflow base container talk using shareProcessNamespace and then using \"args\" field of airflow kerberos sidecar to watch the base container periodically and kill the process of itself if airflow base container has exited. This doesn't add a lot onto the performance side as well because the command run by airflow kerberos will essentially be a finding a `pid` in `/proc/*/`.~~\r\n\r\n~~This solution has been tested out on a secure environment like Redhat Openshift in conjunction to on prem kubernetes distribution.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nSome approaches were discussed in this PR. The consensus is to handle using combination of EXIT file for k8s version < 1.28 and using native sidecar containers for 1.28+\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^

running test with pytest-xdist, tests can be executed in random order in multiple workers. This means that if a test leaves a side-effect, it might affect another test - much more easily, because you are not able to rely on the sequence of test execution.\r\n\r\nThe `recalculate_patterns` fixture in \"test_serde\" had such a side effect and caused #35699 to happen.\r\n\r\nIt was used in order to clear the cache BEFORE the test so that it could reload the patterns using different configugration provided by the test as new configuration.\r\n\r\nThe side effect of it was however such, that after the test completed, the new configuration remained in the cache AFTER the test has been completed - thus if THE SAME xdist worker started ANOTHER test that relied on the cache containting \"regular\" value (and it did not use the same fixtuere to clean it), it - surpisingly - got the value that was read from the special configuration provided by the previous test.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by clearing the cache also AFTER the test has completed, which means that any other test running in the same worker will refresh the test again - with the configuration it is supposed to have. This is done with try/finally pattern, because context manager / yield will not execute the post-yield code when an exception is thrown, so if there is a failed assertion, the cache_clear afer yield might not happen and such `cache_clear` test that fails might still cause cache pollution.\r\n\r\nFixes: #35699\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

often use the DAG Import Error in the UI to help debug DAGs. To access the details I need I often have to expand two separate expand/collapse buttons, one for the DAG Import Error, and one for the specific DAG. Given the individual DAG errors only hide a few extra lines of text, I don't think it is necessary for both of these expand/collapse sections to be default collapse. I propose the specific DAGs expand/collapse default is changed from collapse to expand.

(and for quite some future) we will run 4 k8s tests max in paralell on CI. Running 4 in parallel is too much (not enough resources) and while running 3 in parallel is possible, since we have 4 runs, we do not gain much by running 3 in parallel (first the 3 of them complete and 4th start and runs generally on its own after fist of the 3 completes, which means generally just before the other 2 complete. Since the parallelism gains are not linear due to contention on common resources, runnning 3x parallel k8s runs is for sure slower than running 2x of them at the same time, so proabbly we can gain a few minutes by running 2 + 2.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes maximum number of k8s runs as 1/4 of available CPUs - which also makes sense taking into account how many parallell processes we have in each k8s test.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

and spellchecking of docs is run indepenently as two separate sphinx runs. Spellchecking is faster than building but not a lot - so if we separate these two, instead of one 17 minute job we will have two <10 minutes ones. This means that:\r\n\r\n* elapsed time of running docs build will be much faster (as long as we have enough parallell runners)\r\n* it will be easier to see if the structure of the docs is wrong or if spellcheck is a problem\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

documentation notes that the arguments 'task_id' and 'owner' are both mandatory.

that.","created_at":"2023-11-19T09:52:54Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T21:26:04Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T22:03:00Z","merged_at":"2023-11-20T22:03:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"0711d50597fd0cfc5afd46dc9b7ff3e207b27d0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3508325829,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK287RHM3F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:doc-only","name":"type:doc-only","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

we are using setuptools (for now) to build airflow packages,\r\nwe still want to run the build in docker image in order to not take\r\nthe risk that code from forks is executed as part of the job that can\r\nhave access to secrets and package writing.\r\n\r\nHowever we do not need the whole Airflow CI image for that. We can\r\nuse two different images:\r\n\r\n* official Node image to compile assets on CI\r\n* Custom docker image based on Python, where we only install git,\r\n  gitpython and wheels/pip in the right versions in order to retrieve\r\n  commit hash\r\n\r\nSince compiling assets via mounted volume on MacOS is slow, we optimize\r\nthe build and assets on MacOS are compiled locally using pre-commits -\r\nbut in CI / on Linux we compile assets using the Node image.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the images used and uses Python script to build the\r\npackages rather than bash script.\r\n\r\nBuilding PROD image is also faster now in CI as it does not need to pull\r\nCI image to build packages - so we can remove the step of pulling the\r\nCI image needed for PROD build. We still need to wait for the\r\nconstraints to be prepared so PROD build waits for CI image to complete,\r\nbut it does not pull nor use the image.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PROD image is built based on source constraints that are constraints based on depdencies available in the CI image. We have a separate job generating all constraints (source, PyPI, No providers).\r\n\r\nGeneration of Source constraints is very fast (seconds) but generation of PyPI and No Providers constraints is a lot longer because it requires to remove (and reinstalling) of provider packages from PyPI and it takes ~15 minutes - but we could start it way faster if we do not wait for the non-source constraints and let them run in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes it:\r\n\r\n* source constraints are also generated right after images are built and separately uploaded as source-constraints artifacts\r\n\r\n* PROD image build uses the source constraints and the PROD image job does not have to wait for the \"preview-costraints\" job.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PROD image is built based on source constraints that are constraints based on depdencies available in the CI image. We have a separate job generating all constraints (source, PyPI, No providers).\r\n\r\nGeneration of Source constraints is very fast (seconds) but generation of PyPI and No Providers constraints is a lot longer because it requires to remove (and reinstalling) of provider packages from PyPI and it takes ~15 minutes - but we could start it way faster if we do not wait for the non-source constraints and let them run in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes it:\r\n\r\n* source constraints are also generated right after images are built and separately uploaded as source-constraints artifacts\r\n\r\n* PROD image build uses the source constraints and the PROD image job does not have to wait for the \"preview-costraints\" job.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

file processor has special configuration that is triggered by CONFIG_PROCESSOR_MANAGER_LOGGER variable.\r\n\r\nThe variable is set temporarily when DAG file processor is started as scheduler's subprocess and settings are reloaded because the settings are generally loaded during importing of airflow package, so we need to reload the settings with CONFIG_PROCESSOR_MANAGER_LOGGER set.

API.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/148540755/505c6bed-6459-43b6-b5ab-823d48015fbf)\r\n\r\nTasks with no XCom\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/148540755/fb7cf5c3-ac08-4dd6-b074-18bc0f114437)\r\n\r\nDynamic task

PR adds a set of callbacks for `KubernetesPodOperator` called when the pod starts, terminates, and is cleaned up, and as when the client is initiated.\r\n\r\nIt provides some valuable params, like the pod spec, the Kubernetes client, and the current mode (sync or async); it could be helpful in different use cases like:\r\n- create some resources based on the created pod and clean up them when the pod is deleted (for ex, a K8S service)\r\n- patch some created resources to link them to the pod and make it [the owner](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/) of these resources\r\n- call an external system to trigger an event, push metrics...\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is only used in sync mode, but I provide the mode param for the future support for async mode. This support is blocked by the way of serializing the trigger kwargs, where all the provided types and methods are serialized as a string, and it's a bit difficult to recreate the original object without a custom serializer or impacting the event loop (for example provide the class path and import it in the triggerer)","created_at":"2023-11-17T21:08:17Z","updated_at":"2024-01-20T17:23:29Z","closed_at":"2024-01-20T17:23:29Z","merged_at":"2024-01-20T17:23:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"6dc53524a50d38c9b74e83562cab6f2c63818de5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

#10913 \r\n\r\nPreviously, when building a connection string in HttpHook.get_conn, conn.schema was used as URL scheme, but it should be URL path. Now conn.conn_type ('http' or 'https') is used as URL scheme and conn.schema as URL path which causes base_url in HttpHook to work as expected.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

allows to build reproducible packages (packages that can be\r\ncompared bit-by-bit) providing that source date epoch is set to\r\nrepeatable value when package is built. This PR implements\r\nreproducibility of our builds by freezing the documentation preparation\r\ntime in provider.yaml as \"source date epoch\" and always using it when\r\nbuilding the package. This way anyone using breeze to build the package\r\nwill have exactly the same binary package produced, which will make it\r\nway easier to verify if the packages are ready for release by the PMC\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nWe will no longer have to check the sources, PMC members will simply\r\nneed to build the same packages locally using breeze and see if the\r\ngenerated packages are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThat also includes permissions bits - flit sets permissions of\r\nthe generated packages to \"no permissions for other/group\" in\r\norder to get bit-to-bit reproducibility - because on some systems\r\numask is set differently by default and created file would be\r\ndifferent because of the permission bit. This caused problems\r\nwhen building docker images - so we had it changed when moving\r\npackages to 'dist' folder, but this PR changes it so that CI\r\nbuild does it when moving packages from dist to docker-context-files\r\ninstead\r\n\r\nThe \"source-date-epoch\" fields have been regenerated in this PR as\r\nwell. Also this PR replaces `lru_cache` method of storing output\r\nof `get_provider_metadata_packages` with custom-stored dictionary -\r\nthanks to that instead of invalidating whole cache of providers\r\nmetadata refreshed from yaml files we can refresh individual provider\r\nmetadata entries after they have been updated. This saves a lot\r\nof time for validation - because every time when provider yaml is\r\nupdated we need to re-read it and re-validate it with json schema,\r\nwith this change we only do it for the updated provider yaml - which\r\nsaves about 0.5 a second per provider yaml update and when you\r\nupdate all provides it is done way faster.\r\n\r\nBased on #35617  so it should only be merged after that one\r\n\r\n(Only last commit counts)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This PR implements\r\nreproducibility of our builds by freezing the documentation\r\npreparation time in provider.yaml as \"source date epoch\" and\r\nalways using it when building the package. This way anyone\r\nusing breeze to build the package will have exactly the same\r\nbinary package produced, which will make it way easier to\r\nverify if the packages are ready for release by the PMC member.\r\n\r\nWe will no longer have to check the sources, PMC members will\r\nsimply need to build the same packages locally using breeze and\r\nsee if the generated packages are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nBased on #35617  so it should only be merged after that one\r\n\r\n(Only last commit counts)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Docker Swarm Operator was impractical as the Docker Service created was never finished in the airflow scheduler. Also logs were not received.  With this fix we make docker swarm services finite and we track their logs properly. \r\n\r\nThe logging logic works like this:\r\nFor the current service we ask the docker API client to give us the logs with the `follow=False`. Otherwise, `follow=True` hangs for ever when the service has finished. \r\nWe poll the docker API in 2 minute intervals, throwing logs to the console and checking if the service has terminated in order to break the loop.\r\n \r\nCloses: #28452\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#35341 \r\n1. Added name field to template_fields in EmrServerlessStartJobOperator as requested in issue #35341.\r\n2. Moved default name setting operation from constructor to execute method\r\n3. Updated EmrServerlessStartJobOperator test class\r\n\r\nSince [self.name = name or self.config.pop(\"name\", f\"emr_serverless_job_airflow_{uuid4()}\")](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/emr.py#L1229) code is in operator constructor, error occurs in specific situation . \r\nAs Taragolis showed well in below comment, if name param is not given and config is given no dict type, error occurs. For example, if config is given by upstream operator (like the example in below comment), error occurs because the type of config is PlainXComArg in this case . And it is a kind of bug which should be fixed. \r\n\r\nIf the problematic section of code is moved from constructor to execute method, the returned_value of upstream operator is converted to dict type (I do not know the exact principle but checked the fact). So the error above does not occur. So I moved the pop operation to execute method. And I think It might be what @Taragolis intended in his first guide.\r\n\r\nI'm a beginner. If I am missing something, comments will make me better :)  \r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
