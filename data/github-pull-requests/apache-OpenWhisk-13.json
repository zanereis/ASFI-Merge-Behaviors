See [this thread][1] for related discussion.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently some of the admin toolings like `wskadmin` connect directly to CouchDB and hence would not work for setups where some other `ArtifactStore` is configured (like `CosmosDBArtifactStore`). To support duch deployments this PR implement some of the wskadmin features in a Scala based tooling which makes use of the `ArtifactStore` abstraction.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe tooling is packaged as an executable fat jar which packages all the requiored dependencies in a single jar and can be executed like \r\n\r\n    $./wskadmin-cli -c application-cli.conf user get guest\r\n\r\nHere\r\n\r\n* `wskadmin-cli` - Executable fat jar. Gradle build would copy this to `${OPENWHISK_HOME}/bin` folder\r\n* `-c application-cli.conf` - Configuration details. For now the db related configuration is specified here\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude classpath(\"application.conf\")\r\n\r\nwhisk {\r\n  couchdb {\r\n    protocol = \"http\"\r\n    host     = \"172.17.0.1\"\r\n    port     = \"5984\"\r\n    username = \"whisk_admin\"\r\n    password = \"some_passw0rd\"\r\n    provider = \"CouchDB\"\r\n    databases {\r\n      WhiskAuth       = \"whisk_local_subjects\"\r\n      WhiskEntity     = \"whisk_local_whisks\"\r\n      WhiskActivation = \"whisk_local_activations\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [readme](core/admin/README.md) for details\r\n\r\n### Commands Supported\r\n\r\n#### User\r\n\r\nmanage users commands\r\n\r\n- [x] `create` - create a user and show authorization key\r\n- [x] `delete` - delete a user\r\n- [x] `get` - get authorization key for user\r\n- [x] `whois` - identify user from an authorization key\r\n- [x] `block` - block one or more users\r\n- [x] `unblock` - unblock one or more users\r\n- [x] `list` - list authorization keys associated with a namespace\r\n\r\n#### limits\r\n\r\nmanage namespace-specific limits\r\n\r\n- [x] `set` - set limits for a given namespace\r\n- [x] `get` - get limits for a given namespace (if none exist, system defaults apply)\r\n- [x] `delete` - delete limits for a given namespace (system defaults apply)\r\n\r\n#### db\r\n\r\nwork with dbs\r\n\r\n- [ ] - `get` - get contents of database\r\n\r\n### Key aspects\r\n\r\n* Requires the configuration provided in form of `application.conf`\r\n* Supports direct execution\r\n* Requires Java JDK to be present on the host\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Packaging \r\n\r\nThe tooling is packaged as an executable jar via [Spring Boot Gradle Plugin][2]. The plugin is used just for packaging and there is no dependency on Spring framework. Spring boot plugin creates a jar with [following structure][3]\r\n\r\n```\r\n|-- BOOT-INF\r\n|   |-- classes - CLI Imp\r\n|   `-- lib - Dependencies\r\n|-- META-INF\r\n`-- org    #Spring Boot classes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows having multiple files with same name like `reference.conf` by ensuring dependency jars remain separate. \r\n\r\nFurther it alse allows packaging the jar as an [executable script][4]. This enable launching jar like `./wskadmin-cli` instead of using `java -jar wskadmin-cli.jar` approach for Linux and Mac setups. For windows users can still use the `java -jar` approach to launch the command.\r\n\r\n### CLI Option Parsing\r\n\r\nIt uses [scallop][6] library to parse the command line options. It also supports sub commands similar to Python [argparse][7] library\r\n\r\n## Open Points\r\n\r\n1. What should be the name of cli. Currently its named as `wskadmin-cli`\r\n2. Where should the code live. Currently its in `core/admin`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

is a replay of https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/3669 with a proper commit message to credit all the contributors.\r\n\r\nConstructs prewarming configuration from runtime manifest and its stem cell declarations.\r\nAs an example:\r\n```js\r\n  \"nodejs\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n      \"default\": true,\r\n      \"image\": {\r\n        \"name\":

configuration is parsed so that the count must be positive and the memory size a valid instance of ByteSize.\r\n\r\nThe invokers will create the stemcells for the runtimes as specified in the manifest.\r\n\r\nThe stem cell details are not reported in the deployment manifest (i.e., curl https://apihost).\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if

systems with high load, POSTing the action container `/init` endpoint occasionally fails with `NoRouteToHostException`. Retry if this exception occurs.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n* So far, the HTTP client retried when the connection to an action container failed with `HttpHostConnectException`. This is safe because no data has been transmitted yet when this exception occurs. Usually, this exception will occur if the action container startup is slow such that the target socket is not listening yet.\r\n* This change adds `NoRouteToHostException` as retryable exception. Root cause for this exception is high system load. It is safe to retry after this exception occurred because it implies that no data has been transmitted yet.\r\n* Needed to restructure the code to add the second retryable exception.\r\n* Lowered the time between retries from 100 ms to 10 ms because this shorter time should be sufficient to have routing available / the target socket listening.\r\n* Added logging so that retries can be seen in system logs.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR enables inlining attachment content as part of attachment name for smaller attachments\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrently [runtime manifest][1] determine if the code related to any runtime is stored as attachment or as string property as part of action document itself. As part of #3450 plan is introduce a new `AttachmentStore` SPI and move code storage to a separate store. In doing that reading an action with code would invoke 2 remote calls. \r\n\r\nTo reduce this overhead for smaller codes this PR enables inlining of attachments as part of attachment name itself.\r\n\r\nUnder this if any   \r\n\r\n1. attachment length \\>= `maxInlineSize` - Then its saved as proper attachment\r\n2. attachment length < `maxInlineSize` - Then its content would be converted to URL encoded base64 string and would be stored as part of `attachmentName` within the action document. Thus it can read without going to attachment storage\r\n\r\nAttachment name for an inlined attachment would be a URI like below\r\n\r\n    mem:T3BlbldoaXNrIEZUVw==\r\n\r\nHere \r\n\r\n* Scheme - `mem`\r\n* Path - Would be base64 encoded attachment content\r\n\r\n### Defaults\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the default value of `max-inline-size` to 16 KB\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [X] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

a way to extend the environment variable set for Controller and Invoker\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #3477 for some set of deployments like those using CosmosDB we need to add some extra environment variables like `CONFIG_whisk_spi_ArtifactStoreProvider`. To support that ansible playbook now supports add a set of environment variables conditionally.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo add extra environment variables user need to define them under `group_vars/all` for specific environment\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ncosmos:\r\n    CONFIG_whisk_spi_ArtifactStoreProvider: whisk.core.database.cosmosdb.CosmosDBArtifactStoreProvider\r\n    CONFIG_whisk_cosmosdb_endpoint : \"https://<account name>.documents.azure.com:443/\"\r\n    CONFIG_whisk_cosmosdb_key : \"some secret\"\r\n    CONFIG_whisk_cosmosdb_db : openwhisk\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `cosmos` is the name of the environment variable set related to CosmosDB. To enable this set user needs to set an environment vairable\r\n\r\n```\r\nOPENWHISK_EXTRA_ENV=cosmos\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `OPENWHISK_EXTRA_ENV` refers to a comma separated list of environment variable set which need to be added. If configured then all variables defined under `cosmos` key would be added to env of controller and invoker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3477)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nAfter #2795 which only provides system-wider concurrency settings, this will allow per-action concurrency limit. \r\n\r\nTo use it:\r\n* specify `whisk.concurrency-limit` configs e.g. \r\n```    \r\nwhisk.concurrency-limit {\r\n        min = 1\r\n        max = 500\r\n        std = 1\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n* enable concurrency in actions using: `\"limits\":{\"concurrency\":125}` in the action json\r\n\r\nIn a later PR, additional changes will be useful in cli, e.g. to enable a concurrency flag: `wsk action create --concurrency 125`

collection of test code coverage for code running within containers like Controller and Invoker\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nSo far with #3249 we have been collecting test code coverage data from unit and system test for code which need not be running within container. However some of the code paths can only be exercised within a running container. This PR enables collecting test code coverage stats for such code paths.\r\n\r\nAs explained in #3243 scoverage creates `build/scoverage/scoverage.measurements.xxx` files (xxx maps to threadId) at runtime to record any code path being hit. Instrumented code has compile time configured paths for the data directory. So for code compiled for coverage data collection on travis the instrumented code would try to write the measurement file under _/home/travis/build/apache/incubator-openwhisk/core/controller/build/scoverage_\r\n\r\nFor normal scenario when code is running outside of container such files are written within `build/scoverage` directory and is accessible when generating reports. However when code runs within container its not possible to access such generated files. To enable that following approach has been taken\r\n\r\n### Preparing Instrumented Containers\r\n\r\nDocker build now supports a `distDockerCoverage` task which generate a new image for controller and invoker containing instrumented code based on `Dockerfile.cov` file. \r\n\r\nThe instrumented container \r\n\r\n* Is tagged with `cov` tag e.g. `whisk/controller:cov`\r\n* Adds scoverage runtime jars and replaces existing openwhisk-common etc jars with those generated by scoverage task\r\n* Adds symlinks in container for data directory path\r\n\r\n### Running Instrumented Containers\r\n\r\nFurther ansible playbooks are modified to look for `GRADLE_COVERAGE` environment variable to enable some specific tasks. Once enabled the new tasks would\r\n\r\n1. Create specific directory for controller and invoker like `/tmp/wskcov/controller`\r\n2. Expose these directory as shared volume with path `/coverage`\r\n\r\nOnce running a path like  _/home/travis/build/apache/incubator-openwhisk/core/controller/build/scoverage_ would be symlinked to `/coverage/controller` which inturn is pointing to `/tmp/wskcov/controller/controller`\r\n\r\n### Report Generation\r\n\r\nIn test module the report generation task would copy all such measurement files from directories under `/tmp/wskcov` to respective modules. The file names would be changed to ensure that they are unique. Post this report would include stats from code running within containers.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3243)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nThe invoker playbook ignores an image prefix when pre-fetching the blackbox images.

Description\r\nThis PR replaces #3232 and makes stem cell containers configurable from the runtime manifest. See the changes to runtimes.json for an example (or the new tests). It is possible to have multiple stem cells per runtime kind. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"runtimes\": {\r\n    \"node\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"kind\": \"nodejs:6\",\r\n        \"image\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"nodejsaction\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"stemCells\": [{\r\n          \"count\": 1,\r\n          \"memory\": \"128 MB\"\r\n        }]\r\n      }, {\r\n        \"kind\": \"nodejs:8\",\r\n        \"default\": true,\r\n        \"image\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"nodejsaction\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"stemCells\": [{\r\n          \"count\": 1,\r\n          \"memory\": \"128 MB\"\r\n        }, {\r\n          \"count\": 1,\r\n          \"memory\": \"256 MB\"\r\n        }]\r\n      }\r\n    ]...\r\n```\r\nThis PR improves #3232 with stricter types on the `StemCell` configuration, filters configrations for runtimes for the ones that exists to make it easier to work with stem cells in the invoker.\r\n\r\nCloses #2401.\r\n\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] There is an open an issue to propose and discuss this change (#2401)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\nLabelled breaking change because it will require downstream changes to enable stem cells.\r\n\r\nIt's plausible we should warn or fail startup if no stemcells are defined.\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Please review the points below which help you make sure you've covered all aspects of the change you're making. -->\r\n\r\n-

Description\r\n\r\nThe invoke.py script infers a binary init artifact based on the file extension but sometimes the binary has no extension or one that is not recognized by the script.

PR is to address issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/issues/3646\r\n\r\nThat issue describes how there is a current bug in the Docker Swift image for 4.1 that causes a compiler failure when a certain condition is met around using structs. \r\n\r\nThe fix temporarily is to add a compiler flag to disable compile optimizations until it is fixed within the Swift Docker image. \r\n\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-swift/pull/59 addressed that. \r\nThis PR is to bring those changes into the Openwhisk environment.

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThese changes allow new scripts using docker-gradle-plugin to use Java properties to pass Docker URL information to

the Travis build to have 2 separate jobs for running tests\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the travis setup in 2 parts \r\n\r\n1. Test requiring only database\r\n2. Test requiring complete OpenWhisk system\r\n\r\nSee discussions in #3572 for details\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a notion of `testSets` which define set of filters for which test to execute. It defines 3 sets for now\r\n\r\n1. `REQUIRE_ONLY_DB` - Test which just need database to be up\r\n2. `REQUIRE_SYSTEM` - Test which require whole OpenWhisk runtime up. Excludes tests under 1\r\n3. `LEAN` - Include all lean test i.e. current master\r\n\r\n### Changes in checkLogs.py\r\n\r\n`checkLogs.py` currently performs some log sanity check like checking if db, controller logs are non empty. With this PR for `REQUIRE_ONLY_DB` controller logs would not be there. So it has been modified to support `tags`. Each check specify set of tags to which it belongs like `db` and `system`. And then `checkLogs.py` would specify the tags which it wants to enforce checks for\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] - Optimize jobs to remove steps not required. For e.g. avoid deploying containers for pure db tests\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3572)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the list originally included 9 items, I have excluded the DHE based ciphers, since by default they allow 1024 bit keys, which is a potential attack vector for the MITM attack.
