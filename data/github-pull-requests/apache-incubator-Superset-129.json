Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere's an issue with running the feature SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE whole using postgres as the metadata db. \r\nFor the expression `CAST('JUScSB3M_' as INTEGER)`  MySQL and SQLite produce `0`, postgres raises an exception: `sqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for integer: \"JUScSB3M_\"`. \r\n\r\nThis causes an unhandled exception at this line:

steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nerror can be reproduced by:\r\n- run superset with pg as meta db\r\n- create a few tabs in sqllab and run a few queries in each tab\r\n- enable feature flag SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE\r\n- reload/visit sqllab \r\n- notice a 500 from the server due to postgres raising an exception trying to cast a string to an int\r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR the above exception no longer occurs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, when loading a dashboard we send down the complete data payload for all datasources used within the dashboard. This is somewhat of a waste, because in the dashboard view the entire datasource isn't needed, only the pieces required to render the slices within the dashboard (as opposed to the explore view, where we need the entire datasource). When datasources have hundreds or thousands of columns or metrics, this can get out of hand quite quickly; we have a datasource that ends up being about 6MB of uncompressed JSON.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new function to the datasource model that filters the full data to only pieces required for a set of slices on a dashboard. This consists of:\r\n- Removing unneeded columns\r\n- Removing unneeded metrics\r\n- Removing unneeded columns and metrics from the verbose_map\r\n- Removing the datasource description\r\n\r\nWhen determining what columns and metrics were required to render charts properly, I referenced the form_data definition from CONTRIBUTING.md to ensure that we included all the required columns and metrics for all the various charts.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNew unit tests. Also load the world bank dashboard before and after the change. See it render the same way, but require significantly less data\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"382\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-11 at 11 44 56 AM\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen connecting to a Snowflake database, the \"Test Connection\" button reports \"Seems OK!\", even if the user does not have proper rights to access the relevant database, schema, role or warehouse. This is problematic, because the connector introduces irregular behavior if proper authorization is missing, for instance returning duplicated schema names during calls to `inspector.get_schema_names()`. This PR introduces a method `BaseEngineSpec.mutate_db_for_connection_test` which can be overridden by a db spec to introduce connection validation, and implements the mostly undocumented `validate_default_parameters` flag (disabled by default, probably due to performance reasons) for Snowflake that validates the connection params when pressing \"Test Connection\".\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9234 introduced a bug in which the table chart throws errors when rerendering with different query results. It also lacks handling of null values in metrics and percent metrics.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/pull/392 fixed it. This PR bumps plugin dependency to enable this fix.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nA fresh install of Superset or `npm install` should already fixes the bug because we published a minor new version.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug, run `npm install @superset-ui/legacy-plugin-chart-table@0.11.16`. Then go to any Table chart, either add or remove a new metric, rerun the query multiple times. Run any query with Table chart multiple times, it should not thrown a JS error like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/76267496-3bd12e80-6228-11ea-89d7-7b136c942f87.png)\r\n\r\nIt should not throw this error after the fix.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Tried to fix it in Safari, which seemed to work, but somehow now causes issue in Chrome. Undoing the fix, with a net delta of a new typeface, SEEMS to me, to work in both Chrome AND Safari, but I feel like I could use a sanity check from @etr2460 or anyone else.\r\n\r\nAlso of note, `react-ace` is on v5 in Superset, where they're on v8. I tried upgrading, and ran into all sorts of upgrade woes. It DID seem to solve solve this font width issue, however. I'll try to make an upgrade somewhere between v6 and v8 on a separate PR, so heads up about that, and speak up with any experience/warnings/objections if you have them.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

This is useful when we analysis traffic. But currently we can't tell the traffic is from dashboard request or explore view.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add `dashboard_id` parameter in the explore_json request which is triggered from all the dashboard interaction, like dashboard load, force refresh chart, periodical refresh etc. Our current log function can detect `dashboard_id` parameter and add it to the log entry.\r\n\r\nNote the `dashboard_id` is added to request parameter, it won't change `form_data`\r\n\r\nThis is change in the logs table:\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"945\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-05 at 5 53 57 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn the mapbox visualization the supercluster package is used to group several points at specific zoom levels. On one of my installations I came across a bug where some points where not rendered.\r\n\r\nAfter some debug I found that when the mapbox is rendered, when retrieving the list of clusters to render [here](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-legacy-plugin-chart-map-box/src/MapBox.jsx#L112), on the [getClusters](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster/blob/575d32dd106885d9e05cbc9c89e372757d2f012e/index.js#L71) function the range considered [here](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster/blob/575d32dd106885d9e05cbc9c89e372757d2f012e/index.js#L87) will not cover the points.\r\n\r\nI tried increasing the precision [here](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster/blob/575d32dd106885d9e05cbc9c89e372757d2f012e/index.js#L50) and [here](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster/blob/575d32dd106885d9e05cbc9c89e372757d2f012e/index.js#L61) to Float64Array but it didn't fix.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be to use the viewport bounds as bounds for the getClusters method but I dont't think we can get those.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Go to SQL Editor, run the following query and click explore\r\n`\r\nselect 52.34852 as latitude , 4.8843 as longitude\r\nUNION\r\nselect 52.35091, 4.87888\r\n`\r\n2. For the visualization type select **MapBox** and select the latitude and longitude fields on the associated select under the Query section and run.\r\n3. At a certain zoom both points aren't displayed\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23409890/75997081-bcc1ba80-5ef6-11ea-9782-3a397badcf47.png)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23409890/75997087-bfbcab00-5ef6-11ea-9854-138773c315af.png)\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n-

[here](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster/blob/575d32dd106885d9e05cbc9c89e372757d2f012e/index.js#L87) and compare them to tree.points[...].x and tree.points[...].y\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSuperset currently only supports having a common truncation function for time grain expressions. BigQuery, on the other hand, requires type-specific truncation functions for all temporal types:\r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#time_trunc\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#date_trunc\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#datetime_trunc\r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#timestamp_trunc\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the option to specify a type-specific truncation function denoted `{func}` in the time grain expression. For example, the time grain expression `{func}({col}, HOUR)` with type `DATE` will yield `DATE_TRUNC(my_col, HOUR)`. Similarly, `DATETIME` will yield `DATETIME_TRUNC(my_col, HOUR)`. This also renames the config option `TIME_GRAIN_ADDON_FUNCTIONS ` to `TIME_GRAIN_ADDON_EXPRESSIONS`, as they weren't really functions, but rather expressions.\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOne of the main pain points with the table chart is that it loads too slow for large datasets. This PR upgrades it to an updated version with improved performance. See [superset-ui-plugins PR#385](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins/pull/385) for details.\r\n\r\nIn addition to upgrade the table chart plugin, this PR also refactors some styling code related to it. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nTested with a ~10,000 rows, 7 columns table in Superset, pagination enabled:\r\n\r\n### Before \r\n\r\n![legacy-table--old](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/75824956-4b98d080-5d59-11ea-9f86-4a17d0770e6c.gif)\r\n\r\nTakes about 6 secs to load.\r\n\r\n![Snip20200303_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/75825254-d8dc2500-5d59-11ea-8da1-8091c8afcc8b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

limit to a very high number\r\n- Feel the difference in reactiveness and loading speed of the table chart\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:  this does not fix #8273 \r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [x] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\n@kristw @graceguo-supercat @etr2460 @rusackas

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nPreviously, we were rendering the Fetch data preview button when you switched away from a running query tab and switched back after the query finished. Clicking on this button would just rerun the query again. Now we check to see if a results key is set, and if so we fetch the results from the results cache\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

click the fetch results button, see no new query run.\r\n\r\nEnsure refetching data previews still works.\r\n\r\nEnsure running normal queries still work\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSQLite allows users to create DBs locally on the machine running Superset. This is dangerous because it allows mapping the local filesystem and can also lead to DoS attacks. There is no good reason to be using SQLite as an analytics DB, so we've opted to prevent it from being used.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a new flag `PREVENT_UNSAFE_DB_CONNECTIONS` which is true by default. Any other future unsafe db connections can be added to the same logic I've written here.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nUnit tested, smoke tested locally\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis changes the dashboard react list view to use the react-based edit modal, instead of linking to the CRUD-based edit page.\r\n\r\nA detail of this implementation is that after editing a dashboard, it will stay in the list even if it is no longer applicable based on the chosen filters. This is intended, as removing a just-edited dashboard from the list could be annoying.\r\n\r\nI had to remove the \"owners\" accessor column as it doesn't actually work correctly when a dashboard has `owners` populated. React complains about trying to render an object. Owners will need a component rather than just an accessor. This bug was invisible before, since the list endpoint for dashboards doesn't actually return owners at all.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR updates the main UI typeface of Superset to [Inter UI](https://github.com/rsms/inter), and code fonts (e.g. SQL editor) to [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Both fonts are under the SIL Open Font License, and license information has been added to `LICENSE.txt` to reflect this, as per [ASF guidelines](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).\r\n\r\nThis work is a small step toward SIP-34 (#8976). \r\n\r\nNote that the Roboto font (not actually used visibly anywhere) was also removed, in both its binaries and `LICENSE.txt` references.\r\n\r\nAlso note that Fira Code is an extension of [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). I included that typeface temporarily for when ligatures are turned off, but decided it's better to just use OpenType features to just turn ligatures on/off, rather than loading a different font entirely.\r\n\r\nFira Code is a font that contains handy ligatures that many people love. However, not everyone might love them, so there's a LESS variable called `@use-ligatures` to turn them on or off (they're off by default). If/when we move to a CSS-in-JS approach (See SIP-37, issue #9123), we can make this selection more dynamic, switchable via user preference or deployment config.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nSQL Lab BEFORE (Helvetica + Menlo)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/75407551-22df8980-58c8-11ea-96a2-fd81b02fc36c.png)\r\n\r\nSQL Lab AFTER (Inter UI + Fira Code, ligatures OFF)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/75407365-a77dd800-58c7-11ea-9883-f27e504fd10c.png)\r\n\r\nSQL Lab AFTER (Inter UI + Fira Code, ligatures ON)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/75403379-6e8c3600-58bc-11ea-9f0e-891dc756a30a.png)\r\n\r\nExplore BEFORE (Helvetica)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/75410335-6f2ec780-58d0-11ea-8caf-0edb97e7d29e.png)\r\n\r\nExplore AFTER (Inter UI - note that viz components are still using other fonts - in this case, Arial)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/75410385-a0a79300-58d0-11ea-9ce5-b9038a54752e.png)\r\n\r\nI've clicked around to other areas, and things are looking OK.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nDashboard supports nested tabs and charts. But user can add anchor in the request url, and dashboard will be landed with the component in the anchor. For example:\r\nhttps://superset.d.musta.ch/superset/dashboard/homes/#TAB-DZy3k25d_ will open a specific tab.\r\nhttps://superset.d.musta.ch/superset/dashboard/homes/#CHART-59WSceLod1 will open a specific chart.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add the anchor component into dashboard perf log, so that we can see which tab/charts are more popular. This will help dashboard warm-up tasks.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@serenajiang @etr2460

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is an example PR for migrating a JS file to TS. I performed the following steps:\r\n1. Rename the file from `setupApp.js` => `setupApp.ts`\r\n1. Install typedefs for imported libraries (ex `npm install @types/jquery` or add `// @ts-ignore` if no valid typedefs exist\r\n1. Type function arguments to their expected values\r\n1. Address all eslint warnings and errors\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI, confirm that previous behavior is still correct. In this case, check changing locales still works and that checkboxes work in CRUD Views\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a couple of updates to the encoding of the query source for SQL queries:\r\n\r\n1. Uses an enum as opposed to a string to int dictionary mapping. \r\n2. Moves the referrer logic (used for determining dashboard and chart queries) from `get_df` to `get_sqla_engine`. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the later was there were a number of places where `get_sqla_engine` were being called without a source and it felt that this would be a better place to add the fallback logic if the source wasn't explicitly defined. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

Using `@airbnb/nimbus` would be preferable as a long term goal, however that library is poorly documented and I had trouble getting it to work with our current setup. I left the WIP on a branch https://github.com/preset-io/incubator-superset/tree/tai/eslint-ts if anyone more familiar with integratin nimbus into existing projects would like to pick it up. For now this gets rid of tslint (and it's overly strict rules) which should make it easier to transition to typescript. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe [markdown module we're using](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown) filters out `script` tags, however it doesn't not sanitize html `a` links. It's possible to add javascript in the `href` property of an `a` tag and this can be used for XSS attacks. This PR checks to see if the html tag contains `javascript|file|vbscript` in the `href` and prevents that node from rendering.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is an example PR for migrating a React component from JSX to TSX. I performed the following steps:\r\n1. Rename the component file from `Link.jsx` => `Link.tsx`\r\n1. Install typedefs for imported libraries (ex. `npm install @types/react-bootstrap`) or add `// @ts-ignore` if no valid typedefs exist\r\n1. Replace the `propTypes` const with an `interface Props` definition\r\n1. Move default props into the default arguments within the React component\r\n1. Resolve any type errors that may have been exposed by the migration\r\n1. Attach before/after screenshots to the PR to ensure the component functionality remains the same\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"308\" alt=\"Screen Shot

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen investigating a bug affecting BigQuery time grains, I noticed that Exploring SQL Lab queries don't correctly detect `TIME` and `DATE` types due to the logic being different in the result set code vs the SqlAlchemy model. This PR adds a method to `BaseEngineSpec` for matching database specific column types (e.g. `NVARCHAR`, `DATETIME`, `BIGINT`) to generic types (temporal, numeric and date). In addition, type matching logic in `SupersetResultSet` is replaced with said logic, ensuring that type inference is uniform across models.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTest locally + CI (old + new

superset-node has been updated from \r\n\r\n`command: [\"bash\", \"-c\", \"cd /app/superset/assets && npm install && npm run dev\"]` \r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n`command: [\"bash\", \"-c\", \"cd

error:\r\n```\r\nsuperset-node_1    | bash: line 0: cd: /app/superset-frontend: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis just adds the required volume mounts.\r\n\r\n### CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose

Originally the intent was to ensure that the table column orders adhered to the UI. The PR somewhat morphed to contain:\r\n\r\n1. Updated the validity matrix to ensure that defining percent metrics is not viable when `NOT GROUPED BY` columns are defined. \r\n2. Replaced outdated Python filter/maps with list comprehensions and Pandas column operators.\r\n3. Ensure that the resulting data frame is ordered according to group-by or non-group-by column, metrics, and percent metrics.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nPreset would like query sharing to abide by the rules of query visibility used in the rest of the project. To accomplish this, we have updated the `Share Query` button to leverage the saved query functionality rather than the `KV` model, with a feature flag should other organizations want to maintain the current functionality. We have also added a feature flag to disable the `/kv` endpoints entirely. They appear to be used only for query sharing inside of the Superset project, but we do not know how these are leveraged in other systems.\r\n\r\nNote that following the link to the saved query will *open* the saved query in SQLLab, rather than the current behavior, which is to *open a copy* of the saved query in SQLLab.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if
