PR is intended to slightly improve ServerSelector class:\r\n\r\n1. Get rid of TreeMap creation on each call to pick() method and store servers in Int2ObjectRBTreeMap instead. Pick() is called for every segment for each query on broker side, so a lot of temp collections are created\r\n2. Use Int2ObjectRBTreeMap instead of TreeMap and change TierSelectorStrategy interface to accept Int2ObjectRBTreeMap instead of TreeMap\r\n3. Pick method in TierSelectorStrategy does not modify input map anymore\r\n4. Extend ServerSelectStrategy and TierSelectorStrategy interfaces with method for multiple instance selection and use it in ServerSelector to simplify logic and keep all selection details in strategy implementation\r\n\r\nInitial PR:

points for authentication/authorization\r\n===========================================\r\nThis PR implements several enhancements to the Druid security system with the following goals in mind:\r\n- Decouple the authentication logic from the authorization logic\r\n- Continue to allow extensibility for the decoupled authentication and authorization logic\r\n- Allow multiple authentication mechanisms to be used simultaneously\r\n\r\nExisting Design\r\n=======================\r\nThe following section describes the existing procedure for creating an extension that handles authentication and authorization:\r\n\r\n1. Define a ServletFilterHolder in the extension that performs authentication checks on intercepted HTTP requests, in the Filter returned by getFilter()\r\n2. After authenticating the request, the Filter attaches an AuthorizationInfo object to the HTTP request. The AuthorizationInfo object is assumed to contain the authenticated identity and any other information needed from the request to perform authorization checks.\r\n3. The endpoint for the request retrives the AuthorizationInfo object, calling isAuthorized() on Resource/Action pairs that describe the access request.\r\n\r\nSome limitations of the current system are:\r\n- The authentication filter is currently responsible for creating the AuthorizationInfo decision object, so changing which authorization implementation is used requires code changes to any authentication filter being used.\r\n- Only one authentication method can be active at a given time (a user could enable multiple authentication filters at once, but a single request would have to pass all of the authentication filters that were enabled)\r\n- Fail-open behavior, if a security-sensitive endpoint fails to perform authorization checks due to a bug or design omission, requests to that endpoint will be allowed by default.\r\n\r\nPR Change Summary\r\n=======================\r\n- Adds two new extensible interfaces for security logic, Authenticator and Authorizer \r\n- Refactors existing security checks in various endpoints to use these new interfaces instead of the old AuthorizationInfo\r\n- Adds security checks to endpoints that did not have them (e.g., KafkaIndexTask)\r\n- Adds logic to create a chain of Authenticators for managing multiple authentication schemes\r\n- Adds two security sanity check filters (described in \"Authorization Validation\" below)\r\n\r\nExample Implementation\r\n=======================\r\nAn extension that uses these interfaces to provide support for HTTP Basic authentication and a simple RBAC authorization system can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jon-wei/druid/pull/1\r\n\r\nAuthentication and Authorization\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nAuthenticator\r\n---------\r\nThis interface is essentially a ServletFilterHolder with additional requirements on the getFilter() method contract, plus:\r\n- A method that returns a WWW-Authenticate challenge header appropriate for the authentication mechanism.\r\n- A method for creating a wrapped HTTP client that can authenticate using the Authenticator's authentication scheme, used for internal Druid node communications (e.g., broker -> historical messages)\r\n- A method for authenticating credentials contained in a JDBC connection context, used for authenticating Druid SQL requests received via JDBC\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * @return The type name of this authenticator. Should be identical to the JsonTypeInfo type.\r\n   */\r\n  public String getTypeName();\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Create a Filter that performs authentication checks on incoming HTTP requests.\r\n   *\r\n   * If the authentication succeeds, the Filter should set the \"Druid-Auth-Token\" attriabute in the request,\r\n   * containing a String that represents the authenticated identity of the requester.\r\n   *\r\n   * If the \"Druid-Auth-Token\" attribute is already set (i.e., request has been authenticated by an earlier Filter),\r\n   * this Filter should skip any authentication checks and proceed to the next Filter.\r\n   *\r\n   * If the authentication fails, the Filter should not send an error response.

If the Druid-Auth-Token attribute is not set, but the request was not anonymous (had an authentication header), a 403 Forbidden error response will be sent. If an anonymous request is received, this filter will build a WWW-Authenticate header for each Authenticator by calling getAuthChallengeHeader() and add these to the 401 Unauthorized error response that will be sent, providing the client with a list of supported HTTP authentication schemes. If authentication succeeded, this filter will do nothing.\r\n\r\nA Filter that performs a sanity check on requests will always be placed at the start of the filter chain. This filter will check that the Druid-Auth-Token attribute is not set in the request (i.e., the client trying to fake an authentication result). The filter will also check for a \"Druid-Auth-Token-Checked\" attribute (described later in the proposal). An error response will be sent if either of these attributes are seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthorizer\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAn Authorizer is responsible for performing authorization checks for resource accesses. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface Authorizer\r\n{\r\n  /**\r\n   * Check if the entity represented by `identity` is authorized to perform `action` on `resource`.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param identity The identity of the requester\r\n   * @param resource The resource to be accessed\r\n   * @param action The action to perform on the resource\r\n   * @return An Access object representing the result of the authorization check.\r\n   */\r\n  public Access authorize(String identity, Resource resource, Action action);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis interface is intended to replace the current AuthorizationInfo. A single instance of each Authorizer will be created per node.\r\n\r\nSecurity-sensitive endpoints will need to extract the identity string contained in the request's Druid-Auth-Token attribute, previously set by an Authenticator. Each endpoint will pass this identity String to the Authorizer's authorize() method along with any Resource/Action pairs created for the request being handled.\r\n\r\nThe endpoint can use these checks to filter out resources or deny the request as needed. \r\n\r\nAfter a request is authorized, a new attribute, \"Druid-Auth-Token-Checked\", should be set in the request header with the result of the authorization decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthorization Validation\r\n---------\r\nAnother servlet filter will be defined to check that all requests undergo authorization if security features are enabled.\r\n\r\nThis filter will be applied after a request has been processed by an endpoint but before the response is sent to the client. If the \"Druid-Auth-Token-Checked\" attribute is not set in the request, then an error response will be sent instead of the actual response.\r\n\r\nThis helps to reduce the instances of fail-open behavior. However, this mechanism is imperfect as any state changes that took place during the request handling will still take effect, even if the response is killed. This feature is more intended to help detect authorization bugs or design omissions.\r\n\r\nNamespaces\r\n---------\r\nAuthenticator and Authorizer implementations are linked through a namespace string. Authenticators tag an authenticated request with a namespace, which is used to route the authenticated request to the Authorizer implementation that registered itself with a matching namespace.\r\n\r\nThis is to support cases where an Authorizer implementation is only intended to authorize requests from a specific authenticator (an implementation may have assumptions about the user name format, for example).\r\n\r\nThe details of namespace configuration are left for implementors of Authenticator and Authorizer to decide.\r\n\r\nThe namespace header field is \"Druid-Auth-Token-Namespace\" and contains a String. Namespace mapping is handled by the AuthorizerMapper class.","created_at":"2017-05-13T01:02:37Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T17:38:25Z","closed_at":"2017-09-16T06:45:48Z","merged_at":"2017-09-16T06:45:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2a0e753b618027c18541b550f40c1a757380530","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

for discussion.\r\n\r\nConfigurations -\r\n1. `druid.server.http.plainText` - enable/disable http connector\r\n2. `druid.server.http.tls`- enable/disable https connector\r\n3. `druid.plainTextPort` - port for http connector\r\n4. `druid.tlsPort` - port for https connector\r\n5. `druid.server.https.*` - Jetty server TLS configs\r\n\r\nBehavior of configuring http connector using `druid.host` and `druid.port` is kept backwards compatible. However, if `druid.server.http.tls` is set then `druid.tlsPort` config will be used for TLS port and if `druid.host` contains port then that port will be ignored, this also means that `druid.tlsPort` should be a non-negative Integer . Please see `DruidNodeTest` unit tests for all the different configurations that will work and ones that will not. \r\n\r\nHigh Level Implementation details -\r\n1. Changed Internal Discovery metadata (`DruidServerMetadata`) to include `hostAndTlsPort` in addition to `host` which is combination of host and plain text port. If `druid.server.http.plainText` is not set then announced `host` will be null, similarly if `druid.server.http.tls`is not set then announced `hostAndTlsPort` will be null.\r\n2. Changed Curator Announcer to announce `sslPort` in addition to `port`. `sslPort` will be -1 if tls is disabled, similarly `port` will be -1 if plainText is disabled. \r\n3. Changed `TaskLocation` to include `tlsPort`.\r\n4. Changed `Worker` to include `scheme` which will be `https` if `tlsPort` is greater than or equal to 0 otherwise `http`.\r\n5. Changed `ListenerResourceAnnouncer` to announce `HostAndPortWithScheme` instead of `HostAndPort`. If `tlsPort` is valid then host and tls port with `https` scheme will be used otherwise plainText port and `http` will be used.\r\n6. Modified `PasswordProvider` to include `getPassword(key)` to support getting other passwords than just Metadata Storage Connector password. More details in comment in `PasswordProvider` class.\r\n7. There are decent number of ways to configure SSLContext to be used with HttpClient. As per the code in master if an implementation of `SSLContext` is bound then that would be used with the client. Therefore, keeping it the same way but providing a sample implementation module (in extensions-core) that creates an example context, good enough for most simple cases.\r\n\r\nTODO -\r\n1. Tranquility support - May not be required immediately as added support for simultaneous HTTP and HTTPS connector.\r\n2. Unit tests - Added few tests\r\n~~3. Documentation~~\r\n4. Possibly change integration tests to support TLS\r\n\r\nI have tested the changes locally.

It's bytecode output shouldn't be more risky to use than the default `javac` output. Maybe even safer, because JDK 9's javac [fixes some bugs from JDK 8's javac](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/error-prone-discuss/B2aOPzx11lo/ZEdmkR5ZAgAJ).</s> The stability and safety of this compiler is yet questionable, according to https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4252#issuecomment-300046036. However it turned out unnecessary to make Error prone the default compiler; It's configuration was just updated, keeping it in an optional profile, enabled in travis via `mvn -Pstrict compile test-compile`.","created_at":"2017-05-04T22:38:40Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:22Z","closed_at":"2017-05-12T06:55:17Z","merged_at":"2017-05-12T06:55:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ebfa22955c318250ec0bcfd4b849110043f6a24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

a bug where historical nodes could announce the same segment twice,\r\nultimately leading to historicals and their watchers (like coordinators\r\nand brokers) being out of sync about which segments are served.\r\n\r\nThis could be caused if Druid is switched from local time to UTC, because\r\nthat causes the same segment descriptors to lead to different identifiers\r\n(an identifier with local time interval before the switch, and UTC interval\r\nafter the switch). In turn this causes that segment descriptor to be written\r\nto multiple segment cache info files and then get announced twice after\r\nthe historical is restarted.\r\n\r\nLater, if the historical receives a drop request, it drops the segment and\r\nunannounces it once, but the other announcement would stick around in an\r\nephemeral znode forever, confusing coordinators and brokers.\r\n\r\nAnd when it restarts, the cycle of violence continues anew.","created_at":"2017-05-03T23:23:40Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:24:22Z","closed_at":"2017-05-04T04:02:38Z","merged_at":"2017-05-04T04:02:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0f89e969a24a86a0617e6cb70d1a9b7a9d53fe0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/19","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/19","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/19/labels","id":1571408,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTU3MTQwOA==","number":19,"title":"0.10.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":249,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-08T22:01:01Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T22:13:41Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-05T21:25:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/f75b3f3de899f63b8c7be889c0823c24ab3e97f1","head":{"label":"gianm:fix-tz-weirdness","ref":"fix-tz-weirdness","sha":"f75b3f3de899f63b8c7be889c0823c24ab3e97f1","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28350072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM1MDA3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"gianm/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gianm/druid","description":"Real²time

idea is that for doing projections we need \"one layer to rule them all\" rather than the hodge podge we have now where some combination of the following features needs to be used:\r\n\r\n- extractionFns\r\n- dimensionSpecs\r\n- expression based aggregators\r\n- postAggregators\r\n\r\nBut the bridges between features are lacking. So for example, you can't write a math expression that refers to the output of an extractionFn. Or vice versa. One example of how this hurts is that in SQL we can translate `SUM(x + y)` (using an expression based aggregator) but we cannot translate `GROUP BY x + y` (there's no equivalent construct that works from dimension specs). On the flip side, we can do `GROUP BY CHARACTER_LENGTH(x)` (using an extractionFn) but we can't do `AVG(CHARACTER_LENGTH(x))` (aggregators can't refer to extractionFns).\r\n\r\nSo the idea with this patch is to make virtual columns the \"one layer to rule them all\" by building a bridge from extractionFns to virtual columns (there's already a bridge from math expressions). That makes it possible to translate all of the examples above. The SQL translator will only use virtual columns if necessary in this patch, so not all queries need them, but some do. See some of the new tests in CalciteQueryTest for examples.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to accept that virtual columns might not be the right answer for this, and maybe instead the \"one layer to rule them all\" should be something else, like extractionFns or math expressions. But we do need something and this patch shows what the world would be like if that thing was virtual columns.\r\n\r\nChanges in this patch:\r\n\r\n- SQL can use virtual columns as a projection layer for queries.\r\n- Add ExtractionFnVirtualColumn, which allows creating a virtual column based on an extractionFn.\r\n- Add \"requiredColumns\" method to DimFilter, which the SQL/VC code needed.\r\n- Allow math expressions to implicitly treat strings as numbers.\r\n\r\nNot included in this patch, but some future work might include (for context while reviewing):\r\n\r\n- Ability to do projections for post-groupby \"select\", \"order by\", and \"having\", for example a query like `SELECT SUBSTRING(dim, 1, 2) FROM tbl GROUP BY dim` or like `SELECT dim1 FROM druid.foo GROUP BY dim1 ORDER BY SUBSTRING(dim1, 2)`. We can't do either of those queries right now, because we can't apply functions to columns after grouping. We could make this possible via a similar projection layer like `postGroupingVirtualColumns`. Or something else along those lines.\r\n- Revive the \"arity\" addition to extractionFns from #3091 (see https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3091#issuecomment-281859566) and maybe also the ability to have different return types too, not just strings, so extractionFns can become more useful.\r\n- Implement a case/when that can return either strings or numbers somehow, maybe as an extractionFn.","created_at":"2017-04-25T04:55:30Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:28:35Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T22:39:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04c1e5e2e0a122a90f9ca7b9f42a951e2495e6fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/2041d6226662c731a9a13075d1ed4b26b084997b","head":{"label":"gianm:sql-vc","ref":"sql-vc","sha":"2041d6226662c731a9a13075d1ed4b26b084997b","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28350072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM1MDA3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"gianm/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gianm/druid","description":"Real²time

IndexTask always wraps a given Firehose with the ```ReplayableFirehose```. The problem is that ```ReplayableFirehose``` downloads the whole data in a local disk when it is initialized which can cause the out of disk error. A possible simple solution is to add a max cache capacity to ```ReplayableFirehose```, but I didn't because\r\n1) ```ReplayableFirehose``` first reads the whole input and stores them in the smile format. When it reads back the data, it needs to parse the data of smile format which introduces an additional parsing overhead.\r\n2) I think ```ReplayableFirehose``` is valuable as it is because this is meaningful for truly unreliable data sources. Also, it can be used for fault tolerance of streaming ingestion like kafka does after some modifications. \r\n\r\nSo, I added a new class ```PrefetchableTextFilesFirehoseFactory``` which is responsible for caching and prefetching objects to a local disk. It has three key features.\r\n* Caching: for the first call of ```connect(StringInputRowParser)```, it caches objects in a local disk up to ```maxCacheCapacityBytes```.  These caches are NOT deleted until the process terminates, and thus can be used for future reads.\r\n* Fetching: when it reads all cached data, it fetches remaining objects into a local disk and reads data from them.  For the performance reason, prefetch technique is used, that is, when the size of remaining cached or fetched data is smaller than ```prefetchTriggerBytes```, a background prefetch thread automatically starts fetching remaining objects. A fetched object is deleted when the its LineIterator is closed.\r\n* Retry: if an exception occurs while downloading an object, it retries up to ```maxFetchRetry```. I think this is a temporal solution for handling frequent exceptions occurred while accessing cloud storages, and believe we should handle them at a lower level in the future.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I refactored file-based firehoses by adding ```AbstractTextFilesFirehoseFactory```, and fixed a bug in FileIteratingFirehose which doesn't close after iterating LineIterator.\r\n\r\n<!--
