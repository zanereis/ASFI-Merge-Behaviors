Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR enables Metron to use Knox SSO for authentication.  This PR depends on https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 and, in it's current state, is meant only as a way to demonstrate this capability.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the \"Testing\" section of https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 to add Metron as a Knox service.  Once you can access REST and the UIs through Knox you are ready for the next steps.\r\n\r\n2. Add the Metron REST host to the Knox SSO white list.  Navigate to the `Advanced knoxsso-topology` setting in Ambari at `Services > Knox > Configs > Advanced knoxsso-topology`.  This property contains the complete Knox SSO topology xml.  Update the `knoxsso.redirect.whitelist.regex` param value to include `node1`.

Replace this:\r\n```\r\n<provider>\r\n        <role>authentication</role>\r\n        <name>ShiroProvider</name>\r\n        <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>sessionTimeout</name>\r\n            <value>30</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>main.ldapRealm</name>\r\n            <value>org.apache.hadoop.gateway.shirorealm.KnoxLdapRealm</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>main.ldapRealm.userDnTemplate</name>\r\n            <value>uid={0},ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>main.ldapRealm.contextFactory.url</name>\r\n            <value>ldap://localhost:33389</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>main.ldapRealm.contextFactory.authenticationMechanism</name>\r\n            <value>simple</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>urls./**</name>\r\n            <value>authcBasic</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n    </provider>\r\n```\r\nWith this:\r\n```\r\n<provider>\r\n        <role>federation</role>\r\n        <name>SSOCookieProvider</name>\r\n        <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n        <param>\r\n            <name>sso.authentication.provider.url</name>\r\n            <value>https://node1:8443/gateway/knoxsso/api/v1/websso</value>\r\n        </param>\r\n    </provider>\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Extract the Knox public key with this command:\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_client -connect node1:8443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 | grep -v 'CERTIFICATE' | paste -sd \"\" -\r\n```\r\nCopy the key value (on the next line after `Done`).  Navigate to the `Metron Spring options` property in Ambari at `Services > Metron > Configs > REST > Metron Spring options`.  Append the Knox public key property and value to the existing `Metron Spring options` value.  It should look like:\r\n```\r\n--knox.root=/gateway/metron/metron-rest --knox.sso.pubkey=<key generated from openssl command>\r\n```\r\nRestart REST.  You should now be able to access Metron using Knox SSO.  \r\n\r\n5. Request the global config with this url in a browser:\r\n```\r\nhttps://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1/global/config\r\n```\r\nYou should be redirected to the Knox SSO url with the `originalUrl` param properly set:\r\n```\r\nhttps://node1:8443/gateway/knoxsso/knoxauth/login.html?originalUrl=https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1/global/config\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. After authenticating with LDAP credentials, you should be successfully redirected and see the global config in the browser.  \r\n\r\n7. Navigate to the Alerts UI:\r\n```\r\nhttps://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-alerts/alerts-list\r\n```\r\nYou should go directly to the Alerts UI without being prompted for credentials.\r\n\r\n8. To verify roles are working correctly, authenticate as the `admin` user with `admin/admin-password`.  The `https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1/user/whoami/roles` endpoint should return `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_ADMIN` just as it currently does.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Issues\r\nThis is meant only as a demonstration currently and will likely change depending on the outcome of https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275.  Set up is a cumbersome, manual process right now so we will need to make that easier or automate it.  \r\n\r\nWe also need to consider how we manage the `metron.xml` topology file and potentially add our own Knox SSO topology file.  We can apply the decisions we make in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 for this case as well.\r\n\r\nI am also planning on adding a comprehensive unit test for the KnoxSSOAuthenticationFilter class and maybe refactoring it down to a couple different classes.  Feedback welcome there.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

fixes a bug that causes meta-alerts to not be visible in the Alerts UI when the UI is sorted by 'alert_status' and a meta-alert has been escalated.  This is only a problem when indexing into Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the 'alert_status' field needs to be defined as a keyword in the metaalert index template. This field only exists in the meta-alert index after a meta-alert has changed status, like when an alert is escalated.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Fixed the Elasticsearch meta-alerts template that is deployed with the MPack.\r\n* Added an integration test for this bug.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nFollow the \"steps to reproduce\" outlined in the JIRA to ensure that the bug has been squashed.\r\n\r\n1. Create a meta-alert.\r\n2. Escalate the meta-alert.\r\n3. Submit another search that filters the results to only show meta-alerts.\r\n4. Sort the results by “alert_status” field.\r\n5. The meta-alert should still be visible.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

using the parser debugger functions created in #1265, the user has to manually specify the parser configuration.  This is useful when testing out a new parser before it goes live.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, it would be simpler to use the sensor configuration values that are 'live' and already loaded in Zookeeper.  For example, I might want to test why a particular messages fails to parse in my environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Try It Out\r\n\r\nTry out the following examples in the Stellar REPL.\r\n\r\n1. Launch a development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Parse a Message\r\n    \r\n1. Grab a message from the input topic to parse. You could also just mock-up a message that you would like to test.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> input := KAFKA_GET('bro')\r\n    [{\"http\": {\"ts\":1542313125.807068,\"uid\":\"CUrRne3iLIxXavQtci\",\"id.orig_h\"...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Initialize the parser. The parser configuration for 'bro' will be loaded automatically from Zookeeper.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> parser := PARSER_INIT(\"bro\")\r\n    Parser{0 successful, 0 error(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Parse the message.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msgs := PARSER_PARSE(parser, input)\r\n    [{\"bro_timestamp\":\"1542313125.807068\",\"method\":\"GET\",\"ip_dst_port\":8080,...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. The parser will tally the success.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> parser\r\n    Parser{1 successful, 0 error(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Review the successfully parsed message.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> LENGTH(msgs)\r\n    1\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg := GET(msgs, 0)\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(\"guid\", msg)\r\n    7f2e0c77-c58c-488e-b1ad-fbec10fb8182\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(\"timestamp\", msg)\r\n    1542313125807\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(\"source.type\", msg)\r\n    bro\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Missing Configuration\r\n\r\n1. If the configuration does not exist in Zookeeper, you should see something like this. \r\n\r\n    I have not configured a parser named 'tuna' in my environment (but I could go for a tuna sandwich right about now ).\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> bad := PARSER_INIT('tuna')\r\n    [!] Unable to parse: PARSER_INIT('tuna') due to: Unable to read configuration from Zookeeper; sensorType = tuna\r\n    org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.ParseException: Unable to parse: PARSER_INIT('tuna') due to: Unable to read configuration from Zookeeper; sensorType = tuna\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.BaseStellarProcessor.createException(BaseStellarProcessor.java:166)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.BaseStellarProcessor.parse(BaseStellarProcessor.java:154)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.DefaultStellarShellExecutor.executeStellar(DefaultStellarShellExecutor.java:405)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.DefaultStellarShellExecutor.execute(DefaultStellarShellExecutor.java:257)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.specials.AssignmentCommand.execute(AssignmentCommand.java:66)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.DefaultStellarShellExecutor.execute(DefaultStellarShellExecutor.java:252)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.cli.StellarShell.execute(StellarShell.java:359)\r\n    \tat org.jboss.aesh.console.AeshProcess.run(AeshProcess.java:53)\r\n    \tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n    \tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n    \tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n    Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to read configuration from Zookeeper; sensorType = tuna\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.management.ParserFunctions$InitializeFunction.readFromZookeeper(ParserFunctions.java:103)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.management.ParserFunctions$InitializeFunction.apply(ParserFunctions.java:66)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler.lambda$exitTransformationFunc$13(StellarCompiler.java:661)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler$Expression.apply(StellarCompiler.java:259)\r\n    \tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.BaseStellarProcessor.parse(BaseStellarProcessor.java:151)\r\n    \t... 9 more\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

default max spout pending value set by the Mpack for the Profiler topology is 300. This value is too low and causes the topology to stall and stop consuming messages. \r\n\r\nThis is an annoying issue to debug because I am unable to find anything logged by Storm indicating that the max spout pending limit is breached.  When this limit is exceeded it just appears that the KafkaSpout stops consuming messages from Kafka and everything else would indicate the topology is healthy.\r\n\r\nThe Profiler topology is the only Metron topology that uses Storm's windowing support.  Storm will queue up messages for the window (by default 30 seconds) and process each of the tuples in the window as one unit.  This causes Storm to need to \"hang on\" to tuples longer than the other topologies and this requires a greater max spout pending value.\r\n\r\nThis PR restores the original default value prior to #1221 that changed this value.  There really is no need to define this value by default.  I was a reviewer on #1221 and should have caught this. Doh!\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up Full Dev.\r\n2. Create a profile using the Streaming Profiler in Storm.\r\n3. Allow the topology to run for at least 5 to 30 minutes.\r\n4. Ensure that the Profiler topology continues to consume messages at the end of this period. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds REST and the Alerts UI as services in Knox. \r\n\r\n### Changed Included\r\n\r\n- Fixed minor path issues in Alerts UI code.  Files include:\r\n  - app.component.html - path should be relative\r\n  - authentication.service.ts - logout should match other endpoints\r\n  - alert-search.directive.ts - path should be relative\r\n  - index.html - a relative base href means Knox does not have to rewrite links\r\n- Fixed minor path issues in Management UI related code.  Files include:\r\n  - _fonts.scss - path should be relative\r\n  - authentication.service.ts - logout should match other endpoints\r\n  - ace-editor.component.ts - path should be relative\r\n  - index.html - a relative base href means Knox does not have to rewrite links\r\n- Fixed minor bug in Management UI that was sending the wrong headers when getting the current user (navbar.component.ts)\r\n- Added AppConfigService to the Management UI (very similar to the work done in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1266):\r\n  - Added app-config.json file and AppConfigService.ts service\r\n  - Added code to initialize the app config in app.module.ts\r\n  - Adjusted existing services and unit tests for this new pattern\r\n- Created Metron Knox topologies and service definition files for REST and Alerts UI.  The service definition files are relatively simple and should look similar to other services.\r\n- Created a script to deploy Metron files to Knox\r\n- Added a Spring \"knox\" profile that configures Swagger with the right endpoint paths and enables the Knox SSO ServletFilter.\r\n- Added service definition files to rpm spec\r\n- Added \"apiRoot\" and \"loginPath\" properties to the Alerts UI to format REST request urls and redirect to the right login page after logout.\r\n- Added documentation and unit tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis feature can be tested in full dev with some manual configuration.  After spinning up full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Add Knox as a Service in Ambari (Admin > Stacks and Versions > Add Service next to Knox)\r\n2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-deployment/development#knox-demo-ldap) to enable the Knox LDAP in full dev.  You should be able to authentication with REST using guest/guest-password after this is done.\r\n3. Install the Metron topology and service definition files by running the script at `/usr/metron/0.7.0/bin/install_metron_knox.sh`.  This script copies the `metron.xml` and `metronsso.xml` topology files to `/usr/hdp/current/knox-server/conf/topologies` and the service definition files to `/usr/hdp/current/knox-server/data/services/metron-rest/0.6.1` and `/usr/hdp/current/knox-server/data/services/metron-alerts/0.7.0`\r\n4. Update the REST API path for the Alerts UI.  Currently expressjs proxies REST requests from the Alerts UI but this will now be done by Knox instead.  The `apiRoot` setting in `app-config.json` is used to construct the url for REST requests.  Change this setting in `/usr/metron/0.7.0/web/alerts-ui/assets/app-config.json` from:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"apiRoot\": \"/api/v1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"apiRoot\": \"/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. Update the login path for the Alerts UI.  The Alerts UI normally has a dedicated login page but this is replaced with a Knox login page when Knox is enabled.  Knox will intercept the request, redirect to the login page, then redirect back to the original requested url.  Set this property to the home page of the Alerts UI.  Change the `loginPath` setting in `/usr/metron/0.7.0/web/alerts-ui/assets/app-config.json` from:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"loginPath\": \"/login\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"loginPath\": \"/gateway/metron/metron-alerts/\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny changes to `app-config.json` require a page refresh.\r\n \r\n6. Make the same changes for the Management UI.  Change this setting in `/usr/metron/0.7.0/web/alerts-ui/assets/app-config.json` from:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"apiRoot\": \"/api/v1\",\r\n  \"loginPath\": \"/login\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n to:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"apiRoot\": \"/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1\",\r\n  \"loginPath\": \"/gateway/metron/metron-management/sensors\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Add the `knox` Spring active profile in Ambari.  Navigate to `Ambari > Metron > Configs > REST`. \r\n Change the `Active Spring profiles` setting from `dev` to `dev,knox`.  This sets the Swagger context path to Knox and adds the Knox SSO servlet filter.  \r\n8. Update the Spring options in Ambari.  Get the Knox public key with the following command on full dev:\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_client -connect node1:8443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 | grep -v 'CERTIFICATE' | paste -sd \"\" -\r\n```\r\nCopy the value generated from that command.  Navigate to `Ambari > Metron > Configs > REST` and change the `Metron Spring options` to:\r\n```\r\n--knox.root=/gateway/metron/metron-rest --knox.sso.pubkey=<key generated from openssl command>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `knox.root` setting sets the Knox root path.  The Swagger interface is served by the REST application and provides links for the various endpoints.  Swagger must be configured with the new Knox root path for REST.  The `knox.sso.pubkey` setting sets the Knox public key that will be used to verify Knox SSO tokens.\r\n\r\n9. Restart REST with Ambari and you should now be able to access both Swagger and the Alerts UI through Knox with SSO enabled.  The REST and Alerts UI urls are now:\r\n\r\n- Swagger - https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/swagger-ui.html\r\n- Alerts UI - https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-alerts/alerts-list\r\n- Management UI - https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-management/sensors\r\n\r\nEverything should function normally including login, logout and session timeout.  To test the SSO part:\r\n\r\n1. Request the global config with this url in a browser:\r\n```\r\nhttps://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1/global/config\r\n```\r\nYou should be redirected to the Knox SSO url with the `originalUrl` param properly set:\r\n```\r\nhttps://node1:8443/gateway/knoxsso/knoxauth/login.html?originalUrl=https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1/global/config\r\n```\r\n2. After authenticating with LDAP credentials, you should be successfully redirected and see the global config in the browser.  \r\n\r\n3. To verify roles are working correctly, authenticate as the `admin` user with `admin/admin-password`.  The `https://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-rest/api/v1/user/whoami/roles` endpoint should return `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_ADMIN` just as it currently does.\r\n\r\n4. Navigate to the Alerts UI:\r\n```\r\nhttps://node1:8443/gateway/metron/metron-alerts/alerts-list\r\n```\r\nYou should go directly to the Alerts UI without being prompted for credentials.\r\n\r\n5. Click the logout link in the Alerts UI and verify you are redirected to the Knox login page.  \r\n\r\n6. Login back into the Alerts UI and wait.  The session should timeout and you should be redirected back to the login page.  The session timeout can be changed in `metronsso.xml` with the `` property.  To change from the default of 30 seconds to 5 minutes, change the property from this:\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n      <name>knoxsso.token.ttl</name>\r\n      <value>30000</value>\r\n    </param>\r\n```\r\nto this:\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n      <name>knoxsso.token.ttl</name>\r\n      <value>300000</value>\r\n    </param>\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Perform steps 4-6 for the Management UI.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Items\r\n\r\n#### Installing Metron in Knox\r\n\r\nInstalling a service in Knox involves 2 steps:\r\n1. Deploy the service definition files mentioned earlier by copying them to Knox directories on the machine where Knox is installed\r\n2. Either update an existing Knox topology file or create a new topology file.  This file configures a collection of services.  In our case this includes authentication and urls to the services exposed.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to install these files in Knox?  The approach in this PR only works if Metron is installed on the same machine as the Knox gateway.\r\n\r\nI also opted to create a dedicated Metron topology file.  I think this will give us more control and allow us to expose properties in a more user-friendly way.  Knox has a default topology that you can configure in Ambari but it's exposed as is:  a big xml file.  Does anyone think we should use the default topology file instead?\r\n\r\n#### Adding Knox to the stack\r\n\r\nThis process requires that we add Knox separately through Ambari.  Do we want to make Knox a dependency for Metron similar to Kafka, Storm, etc?  \r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to require that Knox and Metron are colocated?  Doing this simplifies installation and configuration and I would vote we make this a requirement unless there is a good reason not to.  Does anyone think there are cases where users would need to install them on different machines?  If we do that, how do we install the service definition files?  \r\n\r\n#### Ambari automation\r\n\r\nCurrently setting up Metron with Knox is a manual process.  I believe all of this can easily be automated with Ambari.  How far do we want to go in this initial pass?  Do we want to just document it for now?  If we did want to automate this setup with Ambari, we would need to:\r\n\r\n- Put the app-config.json under Ambari control and expose the `apiRoot` setting\r\n- Add the `knox.root` setting to the REST config file (`rest_application.yml`) and expose it through an Ambari setting\r\n- Add an Ambari setting similar to the `LDAP enabled` setting that automatically adds the `knox` spring profile to the list of active profiles\r\n- Possibly put the metron.xml topology file under Ambari control\r\n- Add a call to `install_metron_knox.sh` in the appropriate Metron Mpack script\r\n\r\n#### Quick Links\r\n\r\nAt this point I do not know how to make Ambari quick links dynamic.  You can bind the port to a property but I don't know if you can do that for the scheme, host, and path.  This means that after you follow these instructions for setting up Metron with Knox, the quick links will still point to the urls without Knox.  Does anyone know how to change quick links to point to Knox automatically?  There has been discussion of enabling Knox by default so in that case we can just set the quick links to the Knox urls.\r\n\r\nHopefully a working example will provide more context as we plan out this feature.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a more performant cache when cache sizes are larger.  We've already seen a significant improvement elsewhere in Metron based on the work done in #947. \r\n\r\nThe Profiler should use Caffeine for caching to ensure that the caches are not a performance bottleneck.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up Full Dev.\r\n1. Create a profile using the Stellar REPL.\r\n1. Deploy the profile for the Storm-based Profiler.\r\n1.

this change, when documents are written to Elasticsearch the document ID is no longer set as the Metron GUID, but instead left unset so that Elasticsearch can auto-generate it.  Doing this improves write performance into Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nThis will also be the case for any Lucene based Indexer, including Solr.  This work only covers Elasticsearch, but the same should be done for Solr as part of a separate effort.\r\n\r\nThis change is dependent on the following open pull requests.\r\n- [x] #1247\r\n- [x] #1254 \r\n- [x] #1284\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* The `ElasticsearchRetrieveLatestDao` was updated since the GUID is no longer the document ID.  This instead does a terms query on the GUID field instead of an ID query.\r\n\r\n* The `Document` class now contains an optional documentID field.  If the `Document` is retrieved from one of the DAOs this field will be populated.  When creating a new document, this field will be empty.\r\n\r\n* Many of the integrations tests had to be updated because the GUID and document ID are now different.\r\n\r\n* The Alert UI was updated so that it visually looks the same. By default, the Metron GUID is still shown as one of the first columns in the table.  \r\n\r\n    * The table is actually showing the document's GUID field instead of the document ID as it was before.  The ID field remains, which contains the document ID generated by Elasticsearch.  The user can choose to add this to the table, if they like.\r\n\r\n* This change is backwards compatible.  The Alerts UI should continue to work no matter if some of the underlying indices were written with the Metron GUID as the document ID and some are written with the auto-generated document ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up Full Dev.\r\n\r\n1. Open up the Alerts UI and perform the following basic actions.\r\n    * Search for alerts\r\n    * Escalate an alert\r\n    * Comment on an alert\r\n    * Delete a comment from an alert\r\n    * Create a meta-alert\r\n    * Escalate a meta-alert\r\n\r\n1. Click on the configure wheel and add the 'id' field to the table view.  This will now display both the GUID and document ID in the table. They of course will be different.\r\n\r\n1.  Click on the 'guid' field in any row to filter the search results by the guid.\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-11-14 at 2 44 21 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/48646597-53433300-e9b7-11e8-870b-f061af8cca47.png)\r\n\r\n1. Click on the 'id' field to filter the search results by the document ID.\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-11-14 at 2 44 08 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/48646566-3a3a8200-e9b7-11e8-8370-f596346d4a62.png)\r\n\r\n1. Group by some fields to drill into the data.  In the tree view, click on the 'guid' column and ensure the data sorts correctly.  Do the same for the 'id' column that was added.\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-11-14 at 2 46 43 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/48646519-1414e200-e9b7-11e8-96a2-50c568d909b2.png)\r\n\r\n1. Perform the following actions on a meta-alert.\r\n    * Filter by click.  Click on the title of the meta-alert to view only that meta-alert.\r\n    * Rename the meta-alert.\r\n    * Expand/collapse the meta-alert.\r\n\r\n    <img width=\"853\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-11-19 at 12 08 48 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/48723183-f6808c00-ebf3-11e8-9353-876235ce4b2e.png\">\r\n\r\n    <img width=\"853\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-11-19 at 12 09 09 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/48723199-fb454000-ebf3-11e8-8287-7898cc62b4f1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWhen we're dealing with if-else, the existing code would simply say we need to skip an else. In the case of nested if-else, the outer else would say to skip the inner else and cause issues.  By tracking the number of else's to skip, we can manage the nesting properly.\r\n\r\nShort-circuiting also needed updating, because it was also experiencing a similar issue.\r\n\r\nA variety of unit tests has been added to address both of these, and ensure slightly more complicated nestings are tested.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to original ticket here: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1873\r\n\r\nWe are currently using an alpha version of Bootstrap v4. I updated the project to use the latest stable release (v4.1.3) for a couple of reasons. There were breaking changes between the alpha and stable release that make it impossible for us to use angular ports of Bootstrap like ng-bootstrap. In addition, there are quite a few features and fixes we would want in our project. The list is long, but if you're curious, [take a look at the changelog|https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases].\r\n\r\nBesides updating the bootstrap library, the work mainly consisted of updating deprecated class names and accounting for utility class value changes (for example, the class `.my-1` would give an element 1 rem of margin on the y-axis using the alpha release, whereas it only gives .25rem using the stable releases).\r\n\r\nThere was a dependency removed ([tether.js](http://tether.io/)) and one added ([popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)). This is because Bootstrap switched the library it uses for tooltips and dropdown menus with the update. [Popper.js is licensed under the MIT license](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAll unit tests pass as they should. Visual regressions can be tested manually or by using a diff tool like BackstopJs.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR exposes a JSON file that can be used to configure the Alerts UI.  Properties in this file are read on startup and available through an `AppConfigService` that can be injected.  The use case in this PR is a configurable REST API path.  This path was hardcoded throughout the Alerts UI code but can now be changed in the configuration file directly.  A restart or rebuild is not necessary, the change is visible as soon as the Alerts UI is refreshed in the browser.  I think this could be generally useful for other use cases in the future.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- An `AppConfigService` was added that loads configuration settings by requesting the config file as a static asset.\r\n- The various services were updated to use the `apiRoot` configuration setting instead of a hardcoded url.\r\n- We currently load column names from local storage on startup.  I don't believe this is used anymore so I switched the initialization call to `AppConfigService` and removed the unused code in `ColumnNameService`.\r\n- Updated the unit tests to inject a mock `AppConfigService` instance.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo test this feature, spin up full dev and verify that the UI continues to function normally.  Edit the file at `/usr/metron/0.6.1/web/alerts-ui/assets/app-config.json' and set the `apiRoot` property to a different value.  Refresh the Alerts UI and verify the api path reflects the change in `app-config.json`.  For example if I changed `app-config.json` to be:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"apiRoot\": \"/some/api/path\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI would expect to see the search request url (in the network tab of Chrome developer tools for example) to be `http://node1:4201/some/api/path/search/search`.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

should be able to parse messages in a controlled environment like the Stellar REPL.  This can help troubleshoot issues that are occurring at high velocity in a live Parser topology.  \r\n\r\n* This could help a user understand why a deployed parser is not working as they would expect.  \r\n* This can help a user to test their parser configuration before deploying to their live Metron cluster.\r\n* This can help a user understand why a particular message is failing to parse successfully.\r\n\r\n## Try It Out\r\n\r\nTry out the following examples in the Stellar REPL.\r\n\r\n### Parse a Message\r\n\r\n1. Define the parser configuration.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> config := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n         \"parserClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.bro.BasicBroParser\",\r\n         \"filterClassName\":\"org.apache.metron.parsers.filters.StellarFilter\",\r\n         \"sensorTopic\":\"bro\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Grab a message from the input topic to parse. You could also just mock-up a message that you would like to test.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> bro := KAFKA_GET('bro')\r\n    [{\"http\": {\"ts\":1542313125.807068,\"uid\":\"CUrRne3iLIxXavQtci\",\"id.orig_h\"...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Initialize the parser. The parser keeps track of the number of successes and failures which can be useful when parsing a batch of messages.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> parser := PARSER_INIT(\"bro\", config)\r\n    Parser{0 successful, 0 error(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

The parser will tally the success.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> parser\r\n    Parser{1 successful, 0 error(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Parse Multiple Messages\r\n\r\n1. Grab 5 raw input messages from Kafka.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> input := KAFKA_GET(\"bro\", 5)\r\n    [{\"dns\": {\"ts\":1542313125.342913,\"uid\":\"CmJWpN3Ynwsggof57e\", ...\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Review the parsed messages.  There were 5 messages returned and each have a valid GUID as you would expect.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> LENGTH(msgs)\r\n    5\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP(msgs, m -> MAP_GET(\"guid\", m))\r\n    [3b40ab62-ab6a-4dff-86c5-f35cdb2b01ea, 3b5826a7-f2d4-4df2-a28a-ab1f66037b4b, 9fc5f794-26f6-464f-bb99-05fb649ea465, c7162bee-01f9-4cc2-8e26-13101bc22ac1, b86dbb50-cb1d-4889-87ee-3919bcce6fdb]\r\n    ````\r\n\r\n### Parse an Invalid Message\r\n\r\n1. Mock-up a message that will fail to parse.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> invalid := \"{invalid>\"\r\n    {invalid>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Parse the invalid message.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR attempts to fix the intermittent test failures reported in the Jira.\r\n\r\nFor this failure:\r\n```\r\nrestGetShouldTimeoutWithSuppliedTimeout(org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.functions.RestFunctionsTest) Time elapsed: 0.336 sec <<< ERROR! org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.ParseException: Unable to parse: REST_GET('http://localhost:41396/get', { \"timeout\": 1 } ) due to: Connection is not open\r\n```\r\nI believe the root cause is that we're getting an IllegalStateException in some cases where we're expecting an IOException.  The HttpGet.abort() method is called within an ScheduledExecutorService so it's unpredictable when exactly the request is aborted.  I changed the caught exception to be general so hopefully this gives us the result we expect.\r\n\r\nFor this failure:\r\n```\r\nrestGetShouldHandleIOException(org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.functions.RestFunctionsTest) Time elapsed: 0.314 sec <<< FAILURE! java.lang.AssertionError: expected null, but was:<{get=success}>\r\n``` \r\nAn IOException is being simulated by setting the socket timeout really low and executing a request against the mock server.  Looks like this is not enough to make it consistently fail.  I changed the test to spy on the doGet method and throw an IOException so that it fails every time.\r\n\r\nI was not able to reproduce these problems locally but I think they will resolve the issues.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Load up the code in an IDE like IntelliJ.\r\n1. Execute the tests in `metron-platform/metron-elasticsearch/src/tests`.\r\n1. The tests should all run successfully.\r\n\r\nTest Deployment\r\n1.

goal of this PR is to provide a new \"full_dev\" option for new and old users that does not require as much setup and version matching to try Metron's full dev environment.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the vagrant up command runs ansible locally, on the host machine, to build and deploy metron.  This means that the user must not only have Vagrant, Virtual Box and Docker, but must also have all the tools necessary to build metron ( maven, java, c++ 11 etc ) and run ansible ( python and others ).  It has been a common source of problems for new users to get started with Metron because of version or setup problems.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new metron-deployment/development option which tries to address this problem, and make it possible for the user to only have Vagrant, VirtualBox and Docker ( along with a local copy of the source ) to be able to run full dev.\r\n\r\nThe new option starts the Vagrant VM, but does not run ansible in it. Instead it runs a docker container which contains all the tools/versions necessary, and that container is what runs ansible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Testing\r\nHave the correct versions of vagrant, virtual box and docker installed and running\r\n```\r\ncd $METRON_SRC_ROOT/metron-deployment/development/centos6_docker_build\r\n./build_and_run.sh\r\n```\r\nAnswer yes to building the vagrant box.\r\nAnswer yes to building the docker machine\r\nGo grab a coffee.\r\n\r\nThe end result should be full dev running in the vagrant instance.\r\nThe logs directory will have a log for each run.\r\n\r\nIf you run a second time, you can say no to building the docker machine.\r\n\r\n### Differences\r\n- This does not support skip tags passed on the cli\r\n- This does not support provision\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Elasticsearch index write functionality is currently duplicated between the `ElasticsearchWriter` and the `ElasticsearchUpdateDao`.  This functionality needs to be de-duplicated and shared between the two.  This will help ensure that any changes that need to be made to how alerts are written, for instance whether the client sets a document ID, are implemented and tested in the same way across Metron.\r\n\r\nThis change depends on the following PRs.  Once these predecessors are addressed, review of this will be much simpler.\r\n- [x] #1242\r\n- [x] #1247\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Created the `BulkDocumentWriter` and `ElasticsearchBulkDocumentWriter` that are responsible for writing messages/alerts/documents to an Elasticsearch index.\r\n\r\n* The `ElasticsearchWriter` uses a `BulkDocumentWriter<TupleBasedDocument>` to index messages in Elasticsearch. \r\n\r\n* The `ElasticsearchWriter` actually writes `TupleBasedDocument` POJOS that extend `Document`. This allows it to maintain the relationship between a tuple and the document created from a tuple.  If a `Document` fails to write, we need to fail the associated tuple.\r\n\r\n* The scope of the `ElasticsearchWriter` tests were increased since this was now easier with the new abstractions. \r\n\r\n* The `ElasticsearchUpdateDao` uses a `BulkDocumentWriter<Document>` to update alerts for the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n* The `ElasticsearchRetrieveLatestDao` was setting the timestamp of all `Document`s returned to 0.  This was causing the tests that I added to fail.  I added logic to extract the timestamp from the message and set the `Document.timestamp` if one exists.\r\n\r\nInstead of creating the `BulkDocumentWriter` abstraction, I also looked at a couple alternatives.\r\n\r\n* Another approach I looked at was to simply have the `ElasticsearchWriter` use an `ElasticsearchUpdateDao`.  Unfortunately, this quickly led to a large number of changes. The `ElasticsearchUpdateDao` does not track and record individual failures in a batch.  It instead fails fast if any single update in a batch fails.  To track individual failures, as needed by the `ElasticsearchWriter`, would have required changes to the signature of `UpdateDao`.\r\n\r\n* Another approach was to have the `ElasticsearchUpdateDao` use an `ElasticsearchWriter`.  Unfortunately, the `ElasticsearchWriter` is a `BulkMessageWriter` and requires Storm as a dependency due to its use of `TopologyContext`.  To clean this up would have required a large number of changes.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSpin-up the Full Dev environment.  Use the Alerts UI to:\r\n * Search for alerts\r\n * Escalate alerts\r\n * Add comments to alerts\r\n * Remove comments from alerts\r\n * Create meta-alerts\r\n * Escalate meta-alerts\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1855\r\n\r\nDeprecates the split-join topology in favor of the simpler, more performant unified enrichment topology. Encompasses the following changes:\r\n\r\n- The MPack is configured with the Unified topology as the new default\r\n- Unified topology properties appear first in the Ambari Enrichment config section and in the enrichment type dropdown.\r\n- Documentation changed to emphasize the unified topology\r\n- Performance docs make note of the split-join topology deprecation in favor of the unified topology.\r\n\r\nI'll make another note of it in the DISCUSS thread, but I think we should make a goal of marking split-join deprecated in this upcoming release and removing it altogether shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nDISCUSS thread - https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6cfc883de28a5cb41f26d0523522d4b93272ac954e5713c80a35675e@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\n- Spin up full dev\r\n- Verify that the unified enrichment topology is now running by default. \r\n- View the Storm UI topology details for enrichment and verify that there is no longer a split/join bolt.\r\n- Verify the unified enrichment properties show up first under the enrichments config section and that \"unified\" is active in the enrichment type dropdown.\r\n- Change enrichment type to Split Join and verify that the deprecated topology is still able to be run.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1853\r\n\r\nNoodling on a method to add shutdown hooks to Stellar. Modified the StellarFunction interface to include a teardown method. Added a no-op  to BaseStellarFunction to make it easy for implementations that don't need a teardown.\r\n\r\nRationale - some functions may have long-lived activities that include closeable resources. Adding the teardown method enables function implementers to close any resources opened during init gracefully.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a Stellar REST function that can be used to enrich messages with data from 3rd party REST services.  This function leverages the Apache HttpComponents library for Http requests.\r\n\r\nThe function call follows this format:  `REST_GET(rest uri, optional rest settings)`\r\n\r\nThere are a handful of settings including basic authentication credentials, proxy support, and timeouts.  These settings are included in the `RestConfig` class.  Any of these settings can be defined in the global config under the `stellar.rest.settings` property and will override any default values.  The global config settings can also be overridden by passing in a config object to the expression.  This will allow support for multiple REST services that may have different requirements.\r\n\r\nResponses are expected to be in JSON format.  Successful requests will return a MAP object in Stellar.  Errors will be logged and null will be returned by default.  There are ways to override this behavior by configuring a list of acceptable status codes and/or values to be returned on error or empty responses.\r\n \r\nConsidering this will be used on streaming data, how we handle timeouts is important.  This function exposes HttpClient timeout settings but those are not enough to keep unwanted latency from being introduced.  A hard timeout is implemented in the function to abort a request if the timeout is exceeded.  The idea is to guarantee the total request time will not exceed a configured value.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- HttpClient capability added to Stellar\r\n- HttpClient setup added to the various bolts and Stellar REPL\r\n- Utility added for setting up a pooling HttpClient (and possibly other types of clients in the future)\r\n- Configuration mechanism added for Stellar REST function including settings for authentication, proxy support, timeouts and other settings\r\n- Function implementation and appropriate unit/integration tests (both unit tests and integration tests are included)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThere are several different ways to test this feature and I would encourage reviewers to get creative and look for cases I may not have thought of.  For my testing, I used an online Http service that provides simple endpoints for simulating different use cases:  `http://httpbin.org/#/`.  Feel free to try your own or use this one.\r\n\r\nI tested this in full dev using the Stellar REPL and the parser and enrichment topologies.  First you need to perform a couple setup steps:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and ensure everything comes up and data is being indexed\r\n2. Ssh to full dev and install the Squid proxy server:\r\n```\r\nyum -y install squid\r\n```\r\n3. Create a password file that Squid can use for basic authentication\r\n```\r\nyum -y install httpd-tools\r\ntouch /etc/squid/passwd && chown squid /etc/squid/passwd\r\nhtpasswd /etc/squid/passwd user # (Will prompt for a password)\r\n```\r\n4. Configure Squid for basic authentication by adding these lines to `/etc/squid/squid.conf`, under the lines with `acl Safe_ports*`:\r\n```\r\nauth_param basic program /usr/lib64/squid/ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd\r\nauth_param basic children 5\r\nauth_param basic realm Squid Basic Authentication\r\nauth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours\r\nacl auth_users proxy_auth REQUIRED\r\nhttp_access allow auth_users\r\n```\r\n5. Start Squid and verify it is working correctly:\r\n```\r\nservice squid restart\r\ncurl --proxy-user user:password -x node1:3128 http://www.google.com/\r\n```\r\n6. Next create password files in HDFS:\r\n```\r\nsu hdfs\r\ncd ~\r\necho -n 'passwd' > basicPassword.txt\r\nhdfs dfs -put basicPassword.txt /apps/metron\r\necho -n 'password' > proxyPassword.txt\r\nhdfs dfs -put proxyPassword.txt /apps/metron\r\nexit\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test with the Stellar REPL, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Start the Stellar REPL and verify the `REST_GET` function is available:\r\n```\r\n/usr/metron/0.6.1/bin/stellar --zookeeper node1:2181\r\n[Stellar]>>> %functions REST\r\nREST_GET\r\n```\r\n2. Test a simple get request:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/get')\r\n{args={}, headers={Accept=application/json, Accept-Encoding=gzip,deflate, Cache-Control=max-age=259200, Connection=close, Host=httpbin.org, User-Agent=Apache-HttpClient/4.3.2 (java 1.5)}, origin=127.0.0.1, 136.62.241.236, url=http://httpbin.org/get}\r\n```\r\n3. Test a get request with basic authentication:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> config := {'basic.auth.user':'user','basic.auth.password.path':'/apps/metron/basicPassword.txt'}\r\n{basic.auth.user=user, basic.auth.password.path=/apps/metron/basicPassword.txt}\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd', config)\r\n{authenticated=true, user=user}\r\n```\r\n4. Try the same request without passing in the config.  You should get an authentication error:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd')\r\n2018-10-28 00:32:20 ERROR RestFunctions:161 - Stellar REST request to http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd expected status code to be one of [200] but failed with http status code 401: \r\njava.io.IOException: Stellar REST request to http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd expected status code to be one of [200] but failed with http status code 401: \r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.functions.RestFunctions$RestGet.doGet(RestFunctions.java:209)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.functions.RestFunctions$RestGet.apply(RestFunctions.java:157)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler.lambda$exitTransformationFunc$13(StellarCompiler.java:652)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.StellarCompiler$Expression.apply(StellarCompiler.java:250)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.BaseStellarProcessor.parse(BaseStellarProcessor.java:151)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.DefaultStellarShellExecutor.executeStellar(DefaultStellarShellExecutor.java:409)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.DefaultStellarShellExecutor.execute(DefaultStellarShellExecutor.java:260)\r\n\tat org.apache.metron.stellar.common.shell.cli.StellarShell.execute(StellarShell.java:357)\r\n\tat org.jboss.aesh.console.AeshProcess.run(AeshProcess.java:53)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n5. You should also be able to set the basic authentication settings through the global config:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> %define stellar.rest.settings := {'basic.auth.user':'user','basic.auth.password.path':'/apps/metron/basicPassword.txt'}\r\n{basic.auth.user=user, basic.auth.password.path=/apps/metron/basicPassword.txt}\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd')\r\n{authenticated=true, user=user}\r\n```\r\n6. Now verify you can send a request through the proxy:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> config := {'proxy.host':'node1','proxy.port':3128,'proxy.basic.auth.user':'user','proxy.basic.auth.password.path':'/apps/metron/proxyPassword.txt'}\r\n{proxy.basic.auth.password.path=/apps/metron/proxyPassword.txt, proxy.port=3128, proxy.host=node1, proxy.basic.auth.user=user}\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/get', config)\r\n{args={}, headers={Accept=application/json, Accept-Encoding=gzip,deflate, Cache-Control=max-age=259200, Connection=close, Host=httpbin.org, User-Agent=Apache-HttpClient/4.3.2 (java 1.5)}, origin=127.0.0.1, 136.62.241.236, url=http://httpbin.org/get}\r\n``` \r\n7.

The REPL should call the close function on exit.  To verify this, create a log4j.properties file with the log level set to INFO:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 ~]# cat log4j.properties \r\nlog4j.rootLogger=INFO, stdout\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\r\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5p [%c] - %m%n\r\n```\r\nStart the REPL with the custom log4j.properties file:\r\n```\r\n/usr/metron/0.6.1/bin/stellar --zookeeper node1:2181 -l log4j.properties\r\n```\r\nThen run a `REST_GET` command and quit.  The shell should quit successfully and you should see a log message indicating `close()` was called on the Stellar functions:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/get')\r\n{args={}, headers={Accept=application/json, Accept-Encoding=gzip,deflate, Connection=close, Host=httpbin.org, User-Agent=Apache-HttpClient/4.3.2 (java 1.5)}, origin=136.49.61.168, url=http://httpbin.org/get}\r\n[Stellar]>>> quit\r\n2018-11-07T20:34:03.604 INFO  [org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.functions.resolver.BaseFunctionResolver] - Calling close() on Stellar functions.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test with the parser and enrichment topologies follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the topologies are running and data is flowing through.  It's easier to test if you restart the parser topology with only a single sensor running.\r\n2. Add a Stellar field transformation to the parser that is still running:\r\n```\r\n\"fieldTransformations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"input\": [],\r\n      \"output\": [\r\n        \"parser_rest_result\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"transformation\": \"STELLAR\",\r\n      \"config\": {\r\n        \"parser_rest_result\": \"REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/get?type=parser')\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n3. Listen on the enrichments Kafka topic.  The `parser_rest_result` field should now be present.\r\n4. Add a Stellar enrichment to the sensor:\r\n```\r\n\"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"geo\": [\r\n        \"ip_dst_addr\",\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"host\": [\r\n        \"host\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"stellar\": {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"enrichment_rest_result\": \"REST_GET('http://httpbin.org/get?type=enrichment')\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n5. Listen on the indexing Kafka topic.  The `enrichment_rest_result` field should now be present.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Issues\r\n- Caching was briefly discussed in the discuss thread for this feature.  Stellar provides a caching mechanism but we may need to be more selective about what is cached right now.  I believe this should be a follow on.\r\n- There was a comment in the Jira related to adding a circuit breaker.  Does that need to be done in this PR or can it be a follow on?  Should we also explore/discuss a retry strategy?\r\n- It was also suggested that we create an abstraction for higher latency enrichments such as this in the discuss thread.  I would prefer we create a few of these higher latency functions first so that we have a better understanding of how this abstraction would look.  Do we want to take that on here?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nSeparating metron-parsers into metron-parsers-common and metron-parsers-storm in order to decouple the parsers from Storm. This builds on the work from [METRON-1681](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1681), done here: https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1213. It looks like a ton of changes, but most of it is pretty minor naming adjustments, moving whole files, etc.\r\n\r\nFull dev should spin up and run exactly as it does prior to this PR, which is also how to test this.\r\n\r\nAt this point, no org.apache.storm dependency should remain in metron-parsers-common (as that now lives in metron-parsers-storm). This means that we are typically going to be running, for now, off of metron-parsers-storm jars.\r\n\r\nNothing changes in Ambari, because there's no actual second platform we're running on. In the future, I'd say we need to make some sort of configuration around this, but I'm fine with that being follow-on whenever we choose to build off of something other than Storm.\r\n\r\nThis also adjusts some of the integration tests, so that it's easier to extend to a new platform once we add something beyond Storm.  The current solution would involve a class for every parser for every platform, which seems awful. The new solution uses a parameterized test, and simply one extended class that's platform specific.  Let me know thoughts on this and if we want to refactor this differently.\r\n\r\nThe commit history is a little wonky, since this started based on his PR before it made it into master and there was a variety of merging happening there.  The commits from @merrimanr are from that branch, not coauthored here. I'm a bit surprised git didn't handle it properly, but it won't matter once squashed.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Elasticsearch integration tests use the Elasticsearch API to load the test data before running the tests.  Loading the test data like this does not accurately reflect how the indices will appear in a production environment.\r\n\r\nThis should be changed to use our existing `ElasticsearchUpdateDao` to write the test data.  This ensures that any changes made to the 'write' portion of our Elasticsearch code will function correctly with the 'read' portion. Said in a different way, this ensures that telemetry written into Elasticsearch by 'Indexing' can be read correctly by the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n- [x] Do not merge until after #1242.

Contributor Comments\r\nI went through the defunct Knox SSO feature branch and pulled out the LDAP bits. I made sure @simonellistonball is on the first commit to maintain attribution.  When we merge this, we'll need to make sure that's properly maintained.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is setup the set of LDAP configs, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the JDBC stuff by default.\r\n\r\nI'd say the main objection I'd expect would be around unit/integration testing. Right now there's not anything in this PR, although we could probably pull in the EmbeddedLDAP from the branch and make sure the role endpoint works with it for integration.\r\n\r\nI have run this up on full dev and tested against an actual OpenLDAP instance using https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap. Instructions will be provided in comment to duplicate this testing.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Following comments were posted in earlier PR which I am posting here again with my disposition.\r\n\r\n@nickwallen commented 27 days ago\r\nThanks for the contribution @jagdeepsingh2. To take this any further we need at a minimum the following items.\r\n\r\n**An explanation of what itch this scratches (Why is this needed over Grok parser?)**\r\nThis question was answered in the associated jira ticket (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1795). In a nutshell \r\nAllow for more advanced parsing scenarios (specifically, dealing with multiple regex lines for devices that contain several log formats within them)\r\nGive users and developers of Metron additional options for parsing\r\nWith the new parser chaining and regex routing feature available in Metron, this gives some additional flexibility to logically separate a flow by:\r\nRegex routing to segregate logs at a device level and handle envelope unwrapping\r\nThis general purpose regex parser to parse an entire device type that contains multiple log formats within the single device (for example, RHEL logs)\r\n\r\nAlso, as per GrokParser documentation (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Parsing+Topology) it is intended for low volume scenarios only, while we have tested this parser (RegularExpressionsParser) in very high volume scenarios also.\r\n\r\n**Documented Instructions on how to use your parser. Include a README.md in your code contribution.**\r\nI have updated the README.md file in the metron-parsers project.\r\n\r\n**A test plan including in your PR description showing us how to spin-up and test your parser**\r\nI have included the junit test for this parser, included the JavaDoc and also updated the README.md file in the metron-parsers project. The documentation when used in conjunction with unit tests is enough to test and spin-up this parser.\r\n\r\n**A description of how you have personally tested this**\r\nWe have unit and integration tested this parser for lots of different devices. This parser has also been successfully running in our production environment for more than six months now.\r\n\r\n\r\nmmiklavc commented 22 days ago\r\n**@jagdeepsingh2 Some emphasis on the configuration options for this parser would be particularly useful. \r\nPlease refer to https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-parsers for some good examples of how we document existing Metron parsers.**\r\nThanks, I have added the documentaiton in current PR now.\r\n\r\n\r\njagdeepsingh2 commented 19 days ago • \r\n@mmiklavc Yeah, I performed a rebase yesterday as I had to pull the latest changes from upstream. What is the best way out? Should I discard this PR and create a fresh and clean PR?\r\n\r\nmmiklavc commented 18 days ago\r\n@jagdeepsingh2 - you could try this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134882/undoing-a-git-rebase, but at this point it might be better to just open a new PR bc pushing up to github is going to cause some additional drama as well. You'll want to keep the default checklist that's populated in the description when you open the PR. Please note the comments from @nickwallen and myself regarding what should also be included in your description.\r\n\r\nIn general, once you've pushed a branch to the public it's better to just git merge, otherwise you can get into trouble like this.

re-provisioning the development environment, the \"Install Elasticsearch MPack on Ambari Host\" step will fail.  This step needs to be idempotent so it succeeds when re-provisioned.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Replicate\r\n\r\n1. Start the development environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Re-provision the environment.\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant provision\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. This will fail with the following error message.\r\n    ```\r\n    TASK [ambari_master : Install Elasticsearch MPack on Ambari Host] **************\r\n    fatal: [node1]: FAILED! => {\"changed\": true, \"cmd\": \"ambari-server install-mpack --mpack=/tmp/elasticsearch_mpack-0.6.1.0.tar.gz\", \"delta\": \"0:00:00.360554\", \"end\": \"2018-10-20 17:13:54.836885\", \"msg\": \"non-zero return code\", \"rc\": 255, \"start\": \"2018-10-20 17:13:54.476331\", \"stderr\": \"\", \"stderr_lines\": [], \"stdout\": \"Using python /usr/bin/python\\nInstalling management pack\\nERROR: Management pack elasticsearch-ambari.mpack-5.6.2 already installed!\\nERROR: Exiting with exit code -1. \\nREASON: Management pack elasticsearch-ambari.mpack-5.6.2 already installed!\", \"stdout_lines\": [\"Using python /usr/bin/python\", \"Installing management pack\", \"ERROR: Management pack elasticsearch-ambari.mpack-5.6.2 already installed!\", \"ERROR: Exiting with exit code -1. \", \"REASON: Management pack elasticsearch-ambari.mpack-5.6.2 already installed!\"]}\r\n    to retry, use: --limit @/Users/nallen/tmp/metron-pr1238/metron-deployment/development/centos6/ansible/playbook.retry\r\n\r\n    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************\r\n    node1 : ok=36 changed=5 unreachable=0 failed=1\r\n\r\n    Ansible failed to complete successfully. Any error output should be\r\n    visible above. Please fix these errors and try again.\r\n    ```\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nWhile the Elasticsearch mpack tarball is named with the Metron version (`elasticsearch_mpack-0.6.1.0.tar.gz`), when installed the install path on disk uses the Elasticsearch version 5.6.2 (`/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/mpacks/elasticsearch-ambari.mpack-5.6.2`).  \r\n\r\nPreviously, the expected install path on disk was wrong.  This made the task always attempt to re-install the mpack.  The reinstall of an mpack failed since the --force option is not used.  \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Re-provision the same environment after the fist completes.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant --ansible-skip-tags=\"build,sensors\" provision\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. If the re-provision makes it past the \"Install Elasticsearch MPack on Ambari Host\" step, the change is good.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

${project.version} is not getting substituted at build time, perhaps because it is wrapped inside another ${...}.  This is probably why it is an issue in the stellar script and not the other scripts.\r\n\r\n## Change \r\n\r\n* The stellar REPL launch script was changed in #1232 , but I did not see this warning occur when testing that change.  \r\n* Since #1232, we source `/etc/default/metron` which defines `METRON_HOME` automatically. There really is no need to set `METRON_HOME` and `METRON_VERSION` in the script any longer.  It is cleaner to just remove this (which I almost did in #1232).  \r\n* I use a `set -u` so the script will error if `METRON_HOME` is not defined by some odd happenstance.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Stand-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Stellar REPL.  Ensure there is no warning reported.\r\n    ```\r\n    [vagrant@node1 ~]$ sudo su -\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cd /usr/metron/0.6.1/\r\n    [root@node1 0.6.1]# bin/stellar\r\n    SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\r\n    SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/metron/0.6.1/lib/metron-profiler-repl-0.6.1.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\n    SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/hdp/2.6.5.0-292/hadoop/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.10.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\n    SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\r\n    SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    Functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n    {}\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    ```\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1834\r\n\r\nThis task has been a long time coming after having completed the ES upgrade in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-939. Motivation for completing this now is that Elasticsearch will be deprecating use of the TransportClient in v 7.x. This PR migrates the Elasticsearch client from TransportClient to the newer Java REST API. \r\n\r\n1. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/5.6/client.html\r\n2. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/5.6/java-rest-overview.html\r\n3. https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/5.6/java-rest-high-level-migration.html\r\n\r\nThis builds off and finishes work started by @cestella here - https://github.com/cestella/incubator-metron/tree/es_rest_client. I condensed his branch into 1 flattened commit and built on top of it in order to provide attribution.\r\n\r\nI have a number of tasks I'm still working through, but I wanted to get the review process started. I've minimally validated X-Pack auth and will have some follow-up for SSL. Test plans and a breakdown of the changes will be soon to follow. For starters, full dev should continue to work as normal and you should see data flowing into indexes for bro, snort, and yaf. There are some additional changes to how this client will be configured, which I'll be documenting shortly. The new client does not take a Map of settings any longer now that it is leverage Apache HTTP Async Client https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/5.6/java-rest-low-usage-dependencies.html under the hood. This meant choosing a set of properties to expose and doing a translation to the builder pattern under the hood. Again, I'll have a write-up of this in the migration guide and update the README's accordingly.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This checks off 2 items from this follow-on list https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/840#issuecomment-347281776\r\n\r\n1. Fix Log4j logging problem - classpath issues\r\n2. Migrate to new ES REST client\r\n\r\nPer discussion in the Metron Slack channel, I will be updating the Jira ticket with a series of tasks to be completed prior to acceptance, including performance regression testing compared with the old API.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1833\r\n\r\nManagement UI is displaying units for topology latency as seconds instead of milliseconds. This value should be identical to that reported in the Storm UI. The change is straightforward - spin up full dev and the UI should show \"ms\" instead of \"s\"\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n[Link to METRON-1830 on ASF JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1830)\r\n\r\nPreviously, the dialog box class in both UIs directly manipulated the DOM with jQuery. This is problematic when using a framework like Angular because it causes a disconnect with how Angular handles and tracks DOM changes. We also don't take advantage of Angular's rendering engine this way.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I created a dialog component and service. When a component in the application needs to launch a dialog modal, they simply call a method on the singleton dialog service which determines if the dialog component should show/hide, what message to display and what type of message it is (ie Confirmation, Error, etc). \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n* Create a dialog component.\r\n* Create a singleton service so that we aren't creating a new instance every time we include a dialog in a component.\r\n* Add unit tests for both the service and component.\r\n* Replace all MetronDialogBox class references with the DialogService.\r\n* Remove the old MetronDialogBox.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nYou can test and see the dialog menu in the following areas of the application:\r\n* Creating a meta alert from a group in the tree view.\r\n* Adding/removing an alert from a meta alert in the table view.\r\n* Saving a search.\r\n* Adding a comment to an alert.\r\n\r\nIt should behave just like it did before. If it's displaying an error message, there should only be an 'ok' button, which simply closes the dialog window. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"762\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-18 at 11 25 58 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/47144855-ae0a4180-d2c8-11e8-9958-1079cc3d10f5.png\">\r\n\r\nIf there is a confirmation message, there should be an 'ok' button, which executes the desired behavior ie. creating a meta alert, and a 'cancel' button, which does not execute the desired behavior and closes the dialog.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"748\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-18 at 11 25 42 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/47144862-b1053200-d2c8-11e8-97f3-9651eec985fc.png\">\r\n\r\n \r\nTo look at the test coverage, run `ng test --code-coverage`, navigate to the new `coverage` directory inside the project, and inside the folder open the index.html file. From there you can find the reports for the dialog service and component. Screenshots below for reference.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1438\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-10-18 at 11 11 08 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/47144236-515a5700-d2c7-11e8-97ae-356b18e02479.png\">\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-17 at 4 55 13 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/47095407-7c906800-d22d-11e8-95f5-12709873df72.png)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWhen a failure happens in the BulkWriterComponent, all pending messages in a batch are combined into a single error message.  This results in a single large objects being written to ES and causes performance problems.  This PR attempts to solve this issue by instead creating separate error messages for each message in the batch. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested and verified in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and verify data is being indexed into ES\r\n2. Stop HDFS in Ambari.  This will cause a failure in the BulkWriterComponent.  By default the batch size for OOTB sensors is set to 5.\r\n3. After HDFS has stopped, verify that documents are being written to an ES error index\r\n4. Retrieve a single document from the ES error index.  There should only be a single `raw_message` field.  Subsequent documents in ES should also only contain a single `raw_message` field.  Before there would have been 5 `raw_message_*` fields in a single document.\r\n5.  Verify error documents are displayed properly in Kibana.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis fixes a build issue with pycapa due to a dependency on a newer version of librdkafka, updates the librdkafka plugin as used in the bro plugin, and updates librdkafka as used in fastcapa.  Without this, spinning up the full dev environment (not skipping sensors) is broken.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nSpin up full dev without skipping 'sensors'.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nSomewhat straightforward change to `prepare-release-candidate`.  Primarily fixes [a bug](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/90c5e1d2896b8a95bd6c928e3dab96f1fd85167c/dev-utilities/release-utils/prepare-release-candidate#L226) and changes a delimiter for metron releases from a `-` to `_`.  This should align the script with the latest cwiki [release documentation doc](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Release+Process).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a Stellar function that wraps the Java SimpleDateFormat class.  The first argument is a date format string and is required.  The second argument is epoch time and is optional (defaults to current time).  The third argument is a timezone and is also option (default time zone of the environment is used if missing).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and launch the Stellar REPL.  The `DATE_FORMAT` function should be available:\r\n```\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nFunctions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n{}\r\n[Stellar]>>> %functions DATE\r\nDATE_FORMAT, IS_DATE\r\n```\r\n2. Create a variable and set it to an epoch time:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> epoch := 1472131630748L\r\n1472131630748\r\n```\r\n3. Use the `DATE_FORMAT` function to format the value in the epoch field created in the previous step.  The result should be a correctly formatted date that matches the format string, epoch time and timezone:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> DATE_FORMAT('EEE MMM dd yyyy hh:mm:ss zzz', epoch, 'EST')\r\nThu Aug 25 2016 08:27:10 EST\r\n```\r\n4. Format the date using the default timezone.  The result should match the default timezone of your environment:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> DATE_FORMAT('EEE MMM dd yyyy hh:mm:ss zzzz', epoch)\r\nThu Aug 25 2016 01:27:10 Coordinated Universal Time\r\n```\r\n5. Format the date using the current time:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> DATE_FORMAT('EEE MMM dd yyyy hh:mm:ss zzz', 'GMT')\r\nTue Oct 09 2018 10:13:24 GMT\r\n```\r\n6. Format the date using the current time and default time zone:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> DATE_FORMAT('EEE MMM dd yyyy hh:mm:ss zzzz')\r\nTue Oct 09 2018 10:12:54 Coordinated Universal Time\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a function like `KAFKA_GET` in the Stellar REPL does not work in a kerberized environment.  \r\n\r\n* When the Stellar REPL is launched in a Kerberized environment, it needs to have the Client JAAS passed to it so that Stellar functions can access resources like Kafka. \r\n* The JVM running the REPL never gets passed the `-Djava.security.auth.login.config=$METRON_HOME/client_jaas.conf` JVM arg. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Kerberize the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    source /etc/default/metron\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes sorting on the `alert_status` field in the Alerts UI by defining the field in ES templates as a `keyword` type.  The change was applied to the sensor templates that ship with Metron:  bro, snort and yaf.  This field was added to the Solr schemas as well.\r\n\r\nI also updated our documentation to give users guidance when defining their own templates or upgrading their templates.  I expanded this to include other internal fields like `source:type` and `metron_alert`.  I did not include dynamic fields but I can add documentation for that here if it makes sense.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and navigate to the Alerts UI.\r\n2. Change the status of a couple alerts by opening up their details panel and clicking a different status (OPEN for example).\r\n3. Sort by `alert_status`.  The Alerts UI should properly display alerts by `alert_status` and no errors should be reported in the console.\r\n4. Enable Solr and verify data is visible in the Alerts UI.  Repeat steps 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThe war of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1812\r\n\r\nThe dependencies_with_url.csv is used for our license check. There's not really any formal validation check on the file itself as it's just a csv that gets turned into a Set for purpose of crosschecking our project licenses. This PR simply removes some bad merge conflict lines and fixes some formatting. This change is validated by Travis passing, thus proving no regression has been added in by my changes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Batch Profiler currently only accepts input formats that can be directly serialized to JSON.  This PR enhances that support to accept a wider variety of input formats, most notably columnar formats  like ORC and Parquet.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at doing this in #1191 didn't go far enough.  The tests I had written only tested reading a single text column from ORC, which is not how someone would store the data in ORC.  Each field of the message would be stored in a separate column.  The test I had written failed to test this difference.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* This introduces the `TelemetryReader` interface that handles differences between input formats. \r\n\r\n* This provides two different `TelemetryReader` implementations.  One that handles textual input that can be directly serialized; like JSON or CSV.  Another that handles column oriented input like ORC and Parquet.\r\n\r\n* A new property was introduced to make this configurable to allow the user to define the `TelemetryReader` implementation.\r\n\r\n* The README was updated to define the new property and provide examples for common formats.\r\n\r\n* Unit and integration tests were added or updated to test the new functionality.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Stand-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate the environment by ensuring alerts are visible within the Alerts UI and that the Metron Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n\r\n1. Allow some telemetry to be archived in HDFS.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/* | wc -l\r\n    6916\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Shutdown Metron topologies, Storm, Elasticsearch, Kibana, MapReduce2 to free up some resources on the VM.\r\n\r\n1. Use Ambari to install Spark (version 2.3+).  Actions > Add Service > Spark2\r\n\r\n1. Make sure Spark can talk to HBase.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    SPARK_HOME=/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client\r\n    cp  /usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/conf/hbase-site.xml $SPARK_HOME/conf/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Follow the Getting Started section of the README to seed a basic profile using the text/json telemetry that is archived in HDFS.\r\n\r\n    1. Create the Profile.\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        [root@node1 ~]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n        [root@node1 ~]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n        {\r\n          \"profiles\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n              \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n              \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n              \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n              \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n    1. Edit the Batch Profiler properties. to point it at the correct input path (changed localhost:9000 to localhost:8020).\r\n        ```\r\n        [root@node1 ~]# cat /usr/metron/0.5.1/config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n\r\n        spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n        spark.master=local\r\n        spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=8\r\n\r\n        profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n        profiler.batch.input.reader=json\r\n\r\n        profiler.period.duration=15\r\n        profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n    1. Edit logging as you see fit.  For example, set Spark logging to WARN and Profiler logging to DEBUG. This is described in the README.\r\n\r\n    1. Run the Batch Profiler.\r\n        ```\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Stellar REPL and retrieve the profile data.  Save this result as it will be used for validation in subsequent steps.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ...\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    Functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n    ...\r\n    [Stellar]>>> window := PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"HOURS\")\r\n    [ProfilePeriod{period=1707332, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707333, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707334, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707335, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707336, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707337, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707338, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707339, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707340, durationMillis=900000}]\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\", window)\r\n    [1020, 5066, 830]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Delete the profiler data.\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"truncate 'profiler'\" |  hbase shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a new directory in HDFS for the ORC data that we are about to generate.\r\n    ```\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /apps/metron/indexing/orc\r\n    hdfs dfs -chown metron:hadoop /apps/metron/indexing/orc\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You may need to also create this directory for Spark.  \r\n   ```\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /spark2-history\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Spark shell\r\n    ```\r\n    export SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION=2\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    spark-shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\n[DISCUSS] thread on the dev mailing list: \r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b6a0272c7809c05e8b7aff20171720e8ec76f8a0e9481169c37a4a4a@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nJIRA Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1803\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Cypress.io to our project. It makes us able to run E2E tests, UI integration tests. Also higher level UI tests with mocked services. \r\nAs part of this PR I added tests to cover the following functionalities of PCAP UI panel:\r\n\r\n- checking running jobs on navigating to PCAP tab\r\n- submitting PCAP job request\r\n- requesting job status\r\n- process status in percentage\r\n- getting PCAP JSON\r\n- rendering PCAP table\r\n- showing PCAP details\r\n- navigating across pages\r\n- downloading PDML\r\n- cancelli PCAP query job\r\n- showing filter validation messages\r\n- showing date validation messages\r\n\r\nPlease consider while reviewing that these tests are not meant to cover all the details of the functionalities above. The aim here is to extend the test coverage build up by a large number of Unit Tests with higher level UI tests.\r\n\r\n### New folders\r\n\r\n#### Integration folder\r\nThat contains the actual Cypress tests. The folder name comes from the Cypress naming convention, however, no real integration tests implemented here yet (at least no other than the integration of UI components to a whole application). We could change the name of the folder anytime we like to, but only one folder applicable.\r\n\r\n#### Fixture folder\r\nThe tests are running on mocked data. This makes us able to integrate them with Travis without the need to having PCAP related services available from our CI.\r\nEach file in the Fixture folder represents a response to a particular request. This makes it fairly easy to create and maintain.\r\n\r\n### How to run tests on your local machine\r\nTo run Cypress tests locally please do the following:\r\n1. pull this branch to your workspace\r\n2. move to metron-interface/metron-alerts folder\r\n3. run: npm ci\r\n4. run: scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh\r\n5. run: node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress run\r\n    or run: node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open\r\n    if you like to use the dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Travis integration\r\nAs part of this PR I modified the package.json in metron-alert to make Cypress running in Travis. If you like to see the integration working please check to logs of build step #3.\r\nFailing Cypress tests brakes the build.\r\n\r\nExample of build broken by failing Cypress test: \r\nhttps://travis-ci.com/tiborm/metron/builds/86869264\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\n[DISCUSS] thread on the dev mailing list: \r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b6a0272c7809c05e8b7aff20171720e8ec76f8a0e9481169c37a4a4a@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nJIRA Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1803\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Cypress.io to our project. It makes us able to run E2E tests, UI integration tests. Also higher level UI tests with mocked services. \r\nAs part of this PR I added tests to cover the following functionalities of PCAP UI panel:\r\n\r\n- checking running jobs on navigating to PCAP tab\r\n- submitting PCAP job request\r\n- requesting job status\r\n- process status in percentage\r\n- getting PCAP JSON\r\n- rendering PCAP table\r\n- showing PCAP details\r\n- navigating across pages\r\n- downloading PDML\r\n- cancelli PCAP query job\r\n- showing filter validation messages\r\n- showing date validation messages\r\n\r\nPlease consider while reviewing that these tests are not meant to cover all the details of the functionalities above. The aim here is to extend the test coverage build up by a large number of Unit Tests with higher level UI tests.\r\n\r\n### New folders\r\nCypress files sit in cypress folder. Some of them might look like an empty placeholder but cypress actively uses all files in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Integration folder\r\nThat contains the actual Cypress tests. The folder name comes from the Cypress naming convention, however, no real integration tests implemented here yet (at least no other than the integration of UI components to a whole application). We could change the name of the folder anytime we like to, but only one folder applicable.\r\n\r\n#### Fixture folder\r\nThe tests are running on mocked data. This makes us able to integrate them with Travis without the need to having PCAP related services available from our CI.\r\nEach file in the Fixture folder represents a response to a particular request. This makes it fairly easy to create and maintain.\r\n\r\n### How to run tests on your local machine\r\nTo run Cypress tests locally please do the following:\r\n1. pull this branch to your workspace\r\n2. move to metron-interface/metron-alerts folder\r\n3. run: npm ci\r\n4. run: scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh\r\n5. run: node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress run\r\n    or run: node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open\r\n    if you like to use the dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Travis integration\r\nAs part of this PR I modified the package.json in metron-alert to make Cypress running in Travis. If you like to see the integration working please check to logs of build step #3.\r\nFailing Cypress tests brakes the build.\r\n\r\nExample of build broken by failing Cypress test: \r\nhttps://travis-ci.com/tiborm/metron/builds/86869264\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1806\r\n\r\nUpdate the maven shade plugin version. There is a bug in the current version that causes issues when shading and relocating various libraries. One such example is log4j. A recent doc update for generating the Elasticsearch X-Pack client jar addressed this issue similarly - https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1196\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nRun up full dev and verify data flows through indexing as normal.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\n[DISCUSS] thread on the dev mailing list: \r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b6a0272c7809c05e8b7aff20171720e8ec76f8a0e9481169c37a4a4a@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nJIRA Ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1797\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Cypress.io to our project. It makes us able to run E2E tests, UI integration tests. Also higher level UI tests with mocked services. \r\nAs part of this PR I also added tests to cover the following functionalities of PCAP UI panel:\r\n\r\n- checking running jobs on navigating to PCAP tab\r\n- submitting PCAP job request\r\n- requesting job status\r\n- process status in percentage\r\n- getting PCAP JSON\r\n- rendering PCAP table\r\n- showing PCAP details\r\n- navigating across pages\r\n- downloading PDML\r\n- cancelli PCAP query job\r\n- showing filter validation messages\r\n- showing date validation messages\r\n\r\nPlease consider while reviewing that these tests are not meant to cover all the details of the functionalities above. The aim here is to extend the test coverage build up by a large number of Unit Tests with higher level UI tests.\r\n\r\n## Integration folder\r\nThat contains the actual Cypress tests. The folder name comes from the Cypress naming convention, however, no real integration tests implemented here yet (at least no other than the integration of UI components to a whole application). We could change the name of the folder anytime we like to, but only one folder applicable.\r\n\r\n## Fixture folder\r\nThe tests are running on mocked data. This makes us able to integrate them with Travis without the need to having PCAP related services available from our CI.\r\nEach file in the Fixture folder represents a response to a particular request. This makes it fairly easy to create and maintain.\r\n\r\n# How to run\r\nTo run Cypress tests locally please do the following:\r\n1. pull this branch to your workspace\r\n2. move to metron-interface/metron-alerts folder\r\n3. run: npm ci\r\n4. run: scripts/start-server-for-e2e.sh\r\n5. run: node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress run\r\n    or run: node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open\r\n    if you like to use the dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nUsers have reported problems in the random and batch indexing topologies when this setting is not set.  The primary purpose of this PR is to start a discussion around providing a default value for the Storm topology.max.spout.pending setting in our topologies and implement the changes if we decide to do it.  \r\n\r\n1. Should we provide defaults or continue to defer to the Storm default where a maximum isn't enforced?\r\n2. Which topologies should we provide defaults for?\r\n3. What should the default values be for the topologies we include?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\n[DISCUSS] thread on the dev mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/2e4fafa4256ce14ebcd4433420974e24962884204418ade51f0e3bfb@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nOriginal ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1796\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is the complete removal of [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) from the code base and replacing it with either native functions or [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), another date manipulation library.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\n\r\nIn the Metron Alerts UI, we use a few functions only from moment.js to deal with time like formatting or displaying the relative time from \"now\". In order to do that, we have to import the entire library which causes a significant footprint in the compiled production bundle. Sometimes they can be replaced with native built-in solutions, sometimes they cannot but we can use date-fns which has a smaller size comparing to moment.js\r\n\r\nAs of date-fns v2 is in alpha phase, I rather chose the latest stable version which is 1.29.0. Tree-shaking is currently not supported in version 1 but [it will be in version 2](https://date-fns.org/v2.0.0-alpha.9/docs/ECMAScript-Modules). So once it's released and we can upgrade to it, we can see more size loss in the bundle size. Angular uses Webpack under the hood so if you're interested in what tree-shaking is and how Webpack does it, [follow this link](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) for further details.\r\n\r\n**Changes included**\r\n\r\n- Every code used moment.js is replaced with a built-in function or the appropriate function from date-fns.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend you to go through all the commits I've made one by one. They're straightforward and easier to understand which parts of the app are affected and in what way.\r\n\r\n**Testing the bundle file size**\r\n\r\n1. Checkout `master`\r\n1. Go to `metron-interface/metron-alerts`\r\n1. Make sure you have the latest packages in the `node_modules` folder via `npm ci`\r\n1. Run `npm run build`\r\n1. Take a look at the size of the `main.js` file\r\n1. Checkout `ruffle1986/METRON-1796`\r\n1. Run `npm ci` (this will install the date-fns library and remove moment.js)\r\n1. Run `npm run build`\r\n1. Take a look at the size of the `main.js` file and compare it to the number you've got in step 4\r\n\r\nHere's the output of `npm run build` on the `master` branch:\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-03 at 13 22 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/46411822-08c66980-c71d-11e8-964b-6884c69b9d28.png)\r\n\r\nAnd here's the output on this branch:\r\n![screen shot 2018-10-03 at 13 28 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/46411889-2d224600-c71d-11e8-9ad9-fb0fbd58807a.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, by removing moment.js, we could reduce the bundle size to 1.65 MB which is **15.6%** comparing to the bundle with moment.js. Not so significant but still.\r\n\r\nYou've probably noticed the warning message on the second picture below the output of the build process. This is the result of compiling `pikaday-time` into our bundle via Angular. For the record, it's totally fine. Moment.js is just an optional dependency of [Pikaday](https://dbushell.com/Pikaday/), it works perfectly fine without it. This warning message is there because Pikaday [checks whether it's a Node.js environment and since it is, it wants to load moment from the node_modules folder](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday/blob/master/pikaday.js#L12-L16). However Pikaday doesn't throw and fails silently, the Angular compiler is clever enough to catch this and kindly warn you about it. But it doesn't cause any negative effect in the Metron UI because (again) moment.js is not a required dependency of Pikaday.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the Metron GUID is always used as the Elasticsearch document ID. As documented in [METRON-1677](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1677), using a randomized UUID like Java's `UUID.randomUUID()` can negatively impact Elasticsearch performance.  This change allows a user to customize the identifier that is used by Elasticsearch when indexing documents.\r\n\r\nA property `es.document.id` was added that sets the message field that is used to define the document ID when a message is indexed by Elasticsearch. \r\n\r\n* To allow Elasticsearch to define its own document id, this property should be set to a blank or empty string. The client will not set the document ID and Elasticsearch will define its own.\r\n\r\n* In most cases allowing Elasticsearch to define the document ID is the most performant option. This is the default behavior.\r\n\r\n* Metron versions 0.6.0 and earlier defined the document ID using the Metron GUID, which is a randomized UUID using Java's `UUID.randomUUID()`. Using a randomized UUID can negatively impact Elasticsearch indexing performance. To maintain backwards compatibility with legacy versions of Metron use the following setting.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    es.document.id = guid\r\n    ``` \r\n\r\n* To use a custom document ID, create an enrichment that defines a new message field; for example one called `my_document_id`. Then use this field to set the document ID as follows. This will set the document ID to the value of the message field `my_document_id`.\r\n    ```\r\n    es.document.id = my_document_id\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* If a message does not contain the `es.document.id` field, a warning is issued and no document ID is set by the client.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n  * The `ElasticsearchWriter` was updated to allow the document ID to be configurable.\r\n\r\n  * A 'search by GUID' in the REST layer was implicitly using the document ID, whereas it should be using the Metron GUID.\r\n\r\n* Search results should use the Metron GUID as the ID returned to the UI.  All IDs visible to the user should always be the Metron GUID, not the document ID.\r\n\r\n* The MPack was updated to allow the user to define the `es.document.id` on the Metron > Config > Index Settings tab.\r\n\r\n* The default behavior was changed to allow Elasticsearch to set the document ID.  This is the most performant option in most cases.  I updated the `Upgrading.md` doc to describe how to revert to the legacy behavior.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up a development environment.  You may need to stop the PCAP and/or Profiler topology to free-up slots to allow indexing to occur.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI and ensure that alerts are visible.  Notice that the ID listed in the table has not changed.  This will always display the Metron GUID, no matter what ID used for the document.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-10-02 at 5 43 54 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/46378802-c5abbe00-c66a-11e8-9a65-5ce2ad84dd59.png)\r\n\r\n1. Click on a GUID in the table to search for a single alert.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-10-02 at 12 42 54 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/46378629-3b635a00-c66a-11e8-9b13-6c0f54e48dfa.png)\r\n\r\n1. Create a meta-alert and ensure that alerts tied to the meta-alert are still discoverable by GUID.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-10-02 at 5 45 18 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/46378860-f3910280-c66a-11e8-8612-e18ab2e4ae03.png)\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari and go to Metron > Configs > Index Settings.  Notice that the default setting of `es.document.id` is blank, thus allowing Elasticsearch to define its own document ID.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-10-03 at 9 13 18 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/46412476-a81f3880-c6ec-11e8-9b1e-38fe36c18b03.png)\r\n\r\n1. Open Kibana and verify that indeed Elasticsearch is generated its own document IDs.  You will notice an `_id` field which has been generated by Elasticsearch.  This will be different than the UUID generated by Metron and stored as part of the document as `guid`.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-10-02 at 4 47 52 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/46378868-fc81d400-c66a-11e8-9981-3e62033e44ec.png)\r\n\r\n1. Stop the indexing topologies using Ambari.\r\n\r\n1. Login to the VM.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Delete the existing indices in Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    curl -XDELETE http://node1:9200/bro*\r\n    curl -XDELETE http://node1:9200/snort*\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Open Ambari, and go to Metron > Configs > Index Settings.  Edit the \"Elasticsearch Document ID Source Field\" and set it to 'guid'.  This will restore the legacy behavior where the document ID is to the Metron GUID.\r\n\r\n1. Restart the Indexing Topology in Ambari. \r\n\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI and ensure that alerts are visible.  Notice that the ID listed in the table has not changed.  This will always display the Metron GUID, no matter what ID used for the document.\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF JIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1749\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request contains work which updates the Management UI's version of Angular from version 2.0.0 to version 6.1.8. There are a few reasons why we should update Angular. First, release 2 is no longer supported by the Angular team. This means critical fixes and security patches are no longer being done. It also uses outdated dependencies which do not receive fixes or updates. We're also missing out on a lot of new features and optimizations that we could be taking advantage of, like Ahead-of-Time compiling to speed up page load times, Http Interceptors, updated testing features, an application bundle size reduction of ~40%, etc.  In addition, updating Angular includes updating rxjs to version 6, which includes easier import paths and pipe method chaining.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n* Update to Angular 6.1.8 and related dependencies.\r\n* Change angular-cli.json to angular.json and update file schema to match Angular 6 changes.\r\n* Update karma.conf.js schema.\r\n* Update scripts to use the Ahead-of-Time flag to increase page load times.\r\n* Update name of scss file containing fonts from `_main.scss` to the more descriptive `_fonts.scss`.\r\n* Update font paths to use absolute paths because of [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6599)\r\n* Switch from HttpModule and the Http service to HttpClientModule and the HttpClient service.\r\n* Replace the deprecated `OpaqueToken` with `InjectionToken`.\r\n* Replace the Observable `emit` method with `next`.\r\n* Update Observables to use the pipe() method for operators.\r\n* Update rxjs operator names, import statements and usage.\r\n* Remove lines in templates accessing service properties. Templates now reference class properties that subscribe to service properties.\r\n* Remove passing event payloads if event handler method does not accept parameters. Typescript would not compile otherwise.\r\n* Remove .compileComponents() since it is no longer needed because webpack inlines templates and css before tests are run.\r\n* Remove assertions testing Angular libraries.\r\n* Update unit tests to use the [HttpClientTestingModule and HttpTestingController to mock responses](https://angular.io/guide/http#testing-http-requests) and remove deprecated testing tools like XHR Backend.\r\n* Move default headers to an HttpInterceptor. This had to be done because the application would not compile with the now-deprecated way were were handling headers.\r\n* Replace custom function with [RouterLinkActive](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLinkActive) in order to apply custom classes depending on the current route.\r\n* Format changed files to comply with rules set in tslint.config and make it easier to find errors while upgrading. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo test with unit tests, please follow the instructions listed in the Testing section of the Management UI README.\r\nTo test manually, please follow the instructions listed in the Development section of the Management UI README and visit http://localhost:4200.\r\n\r\n### Other Considerations\r\n* We have a handful of nested Observable subscriptions in the Management UI. We would be better off [using an operator like switchMap instead](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42888604/rxjs-observables-nested-subscriptions).\r\n* I updated the font paths to use absolute paths because of [this issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6599). We should watch this issue in hopes that Angular's compiler gives us an option in the future to change the default path it applies.\r\n* The dialog box is currently implemented as a class without a template that utilizes jQuery to manipulate element class attributes. This is slightly confusing because it does not adhere to Angular best practices, and I see no advantage to the way it's currently implemented. I think this class would be much better off as an Angular component using either the class binding shorthand syntax or NgClass instead of jQuery to handle class additions/removals.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis pull request allows users to submit an aggregated parser topology.\r\n\r\n## Testing Steps\r\n1. Spin up full-dev. \r\n2. Stop the \"Metron Parsers\" service so that existing parser topologies are killed/stopped.\r\n3. Go to Ambari -> Metron -> Configs -> Parsers\r\n4. Change the \"Metron Parsers\" value as: \"bro,snort\", \"yaf (For example)\r\n5. Save changes and restart the Metron Parsers service.\r\n6. Go to Storm UI, and verify that the aggregated topologies viz. \"bro__snort\" and \"yaf\" are started.\r\n\r\n## Testing Done\r\n### 1. Full Dev\r\n* Set the Metron Parsers value as \"bro,snort.yaf\" and restarted the service. \r\n* A single aggregated topology is seen to be started:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20395490/46216724-dbb13a00-c35d-11e8-9651-b39d0766208f.png)\r\n\r\n* Verified stop 'Metron Parsers' service to check that the aggregated topology is stopped properly\r\n* Verified restart 'Metron Parsers' service to check that the aggregated topology is restarted properly\r\n\r\n### 2. Multi-node setup\r\n* Set the Metron Parsers value as: \"bro,snort,yaf\",\"bro,yaf\",\"snort,yaf\",yaf,snort\r\n* The appropriate aggregated and single topologies are started:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20395490/46217047-84f83000-c35e-11e8-87e3-994b72d06cf3.png)\r\n\r\n* Changed the parser list as: bro,snort,yaf\r\n* Restarted the parsers service to validate that the three parser topologies are started individually.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20395490/46223825-0dcc9700-c372-11e8-9027-ad6ad1577f5f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe primary purpose of this PR is to create a parser container abstraction that is decoupled from Storm.  This parser container (I call it ParserRunner, anyone have a better name?) is responsible for:\r\n\r\n- Instantiating the MessageParser and MessageFilter objects for each sensor.\r\n- Initializing the Stellar environment.\r\n- Accepting a raw binary message along with parser configurations and calling the MessageParser.parseOptional method for the appropriate sensor type\r\n- Process each message.  Most of this logic was migrated from the ParserBolt.execute method.  \r\n- Execute callbacks depending on the processing result of each message\r\n\r\nConfiguration is external to this abstraction.  A configuration supplier is passed in when initializing and a configuration object is passed in when processing each message.  I believe this was originally done because we want message processing to be atomic without the configuration unexpectedly changing.  We can easily change to a message supplier during execute if necessary.  A CuratorFramework object is also required for setting up Stellar but we could easily make this optional.  \r\n\r\nI decided to keep writing out of the abstraction in this PR.  I can envision different platforms having different requirements or needs for sending along messages after they are parsed.  Therefore the ParserBolt still handles writing messages to Kafka.  If we do decide we want to add writing to our abstraction we could do it in a follow on PR to keep this from becoming even bigger.\r\n\r\nSince all of the post parsing logic was in the Parserbolt, messages could be written as they were processed rather than having to wait for all messages to be processed. To maintain this behavior I added 2 callback functions in the form of Java Consumers:  onSuccess and OnError.  The other option would be to make message processing synchronous and just return a list of results.\r\n\r\nThis lifecycle of this container looks like:\r\n\r\n1. Container is created from a collection of sensor types \r\n2. Container is initialized with the init method that accepts a Curator client and a configuration Supplier.  This in turn sets up Stellar and instantiates MessageParser and MessageFilter classes.\r\n3. Container is ready and accepts messages for processing and calls the appropriate callbacks.\r\n\r\nBecause this splits the ParserBolt into 2 different classes much of the ParserBoltTest unit test didn't make sense anymore.  I ended up essentially rewriting it and also creating a unit test for ParserRunner.  I tried to represent all the original tests in ParserBoltTest and have 95%+ coverage.  If I missed any cases or made undesirable style changes, let me know.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- ParserRunner abstraction that is decoupled from the ParserBolt.  The ParserBolt now initializes the ParserRunner and defers parsing to that class.  The only thing required is Metron configuration and a Curator client (which could be optional)\r\n- Refactored ParserBolt that sets up the ParserRunner, passes message to it for processing, and writes results to Kafka.\r\n- MessageParser and MessageFilter objects are now created when Storm calls prepare, avoiding serialization issues (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1793)\r\n- Updated unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI have done basic testing in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and verify bro and snort alerts are indexed in ES and the data looks correct.\r\n\r\n2. Test for proper message parser error handling by producing an unparseable message to the bro topic:\r\n```\r\necho 'bad message' | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic bro\r\n```\r\nYou should see a corresponding error message in the ES error index:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n        \"_index\" : \"error_index_2018.09.25.20\",\r\n        \"_type\" : \"error_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\" : \"df83aebc-506d-404b-aba6-c5a740d07c57\",\r\n        \"_score\" : 1.0,\r\n        \"_source\" : {\r\n          \"exception\" : \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse Message: test\",\r\n          \"failed_sensor_type\" : \"bro\",\r\n          \"stack\" : \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse Message: bad message\r\n          ...\r\n          \"hostname\" : \"node1\",\r\n          \"source:type\" : \"error\",\r\n          \"raw_message\" : \"test\",\r\n          \"error_hash\" : \"9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08\",\r\n          \"error_type\" : \"parser_error\",\r\n          \"guid\" : \"df83aebc-506d-404b-aba6-c5a740d07c57\",\r\n          \"message\" : \"Unable to parse Message: bad message\",\r\n          \"timestamp\" : 1537906408288\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Test for proper invalid message handling setting up global validation.  Add this to the global config:\r\n```\r\n\"fieldValidations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"input\": [\r\n        \"is_alert\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"validation\": \"NOT_EMPTY\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nThis should cause validation to fail on bro messages and you should see a corresponding error message in the ES error index:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n        \"_index\" : \"error_index_2018.09.25.20\",\r\n        \"_type\" : \"error_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\" : \"97c356a3-0fd8-4076-9e9c-0213203565c8\",\r\n        \"_score\" : 1.0,\r\n        \"_source\" : {\r\n          \"failed_sensor_type\" : \"bro\",\r\n          \"hostname\" : \"node1\",\r\n          \"source:type\" : \"error\",\r\n          ...\r\n          \"error_hash\" : \"3e5bc436c661cd7df41d4624b5c7422368373f1e57d201500d731007e146c88a\",\r\n          \"error_type\" : \"parser_invalid\",\r\n          \"guid\" : \"97c356a3-0fd8-4076-9e9c-0213203565c8\",\r\n          \"error_fields\" : \"is_alert\",\r\n          \"timestamp\" : 1537907615275\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n ### Next Steps\r\nThis PR contains working code but is still needs documentation.  I am planning on testing a couple different parsers in full dev (grok for example) in addition to what I've already tested.  I will be adding inline comments for some of the less obvious changes or refactors to make it easier to review.  My plan is for any discussion around specific parts of the code to get added as javadocs eventually.  I also think we should add some developer documentation to make it easier for maintaining and integrating this into other platforms.  I imagine a lot of info in this description would make it in there as well.\r\n\r\nThe intention for now is to get some feedback on the overall approach and get people thinking about it.  I'm still working on documentation and will add that soon.  Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

an alert is escalated in the Alerts UI, the escalation should be attributable to a user.  This PR ensures that an escalation can be attributed to the user who initiated the escalation.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nWhen an alert is escalated, the alert is serialized and pushed to the escalation topic in Kafka.  The username and a timestamp should be appended to this escalation message.  The following two fields contain this information.\r\n* `metron_escalation_user`: The name of the user who escalated the alert.\r\n* `metron_escalation_timestamp`: A timestamp in epoch milliseconds indicating when the alert was escalated.\r\n\r\nThis does not change the alert stored in the Indexer; Elasticsearch or Solr.\r\n\r\nThis adds some logging around alert escalation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Login to the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n1. Select an alert then click on Actions > Escalate.\r\n\r\n    ![screen shot 2018-09-27 at 1 43 03 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/46164286-9c9ac000-c25b-11e8-978c-5fb2976d1abc.png)\r\n\r\n1.

a profile defines a triage result when it is flushed the Profiler will generate a message containing the measurement data so that profiles can be used for Threat Triage.  The message that is generated does not contain a GUID.  All messages in Metron should contain a GUID.\r\n\r\nI added a unit test specifically for this issue.  I also took the opportunity to add an integration test that validates that triage messages are produced by the Profiler.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Follow the Profiler README to create a profile like the following that uses a triage result.\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"profile-with-triage\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"update\": {\r\n            \"stats\": \"STATS_ADD(stats, 1)\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"result\": {\r\n            \"profile\": \"stats\",\r\n            \"triage\": {\r\n              \"min\": \"STATS_MIN(stats)\",\r\n              \"max\": \"STATS_MAX(stats)\",\r\n              \"mean\": \"STATS_MEAN(stats)\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Reduce the period duration to 1 minute and restart the Profiler.\r\n\r\n1. Monitor the 'enrichments' topic for the triage message.  This can be done using `KAFKA_FIND` in the Stellar REPL like so.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> %define stellar.kafka.max.wait.millis := 30000\r\n    30000\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_FIND('enrichments', m -> MAP_GET('source.type', m) == 'profiler')\r\n    []\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_FIND('enrichments', m -> MAP_GET('source.type', m) == 'profiler')\r\n    [{\"period.start\":1537890120000,\"period\":25631502,\"max\":1.0,\"profile\":\"profile-with-triage\",\"is_alert\":\"true\",\"source.type\":\"profiler\",\"min\":1.0,\"mean\":1.0,\"period.end\":1537890180000,\"guid\":\"d9d61b92-91a7-4646-bd51-d6021f2904c1\",\"entity\":\"global\",\"timestamp\":1537890199174}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the triage message contains a GUID like below.\r\n    ```\r\n    {\"profile\":\"profile-with triage\",\r\n     \"entity\":\"global\",\r\n     \"period.start\":1537890120000,\r\n     \"period.end\":1537890180000,\r\n     \"period\":25631502,\r\n     \"guid\":\"d9d61b92-91a7-4646-bd51-d6021f2904c1\",\r\n     \"is_alert\":\"true\",\r\n     \"source.type\":\"profiler\",\r\n     \"min\":1.0,\r\n     \"mean\":1.0,\r\n     \"max\":1.0,\r\n     \"timestamp\":1537890199174 }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. The following query should return the profiler messages indexed in Elasticsearch.\r\n    ```\r\n    http://node1:9200/profiler*/_search\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

allows the user to define a 'begin' and/or 'end' time constraints to the telemetry that is consumed by the Batch Profiler.  See the README for an explanation of these values and how to use them.\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request for the `feature/METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Allow some amount of telemetry to accumulate in HDFS.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/* | wc -l\r\n    945\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Stop Indexing, Enrichment, Parsers, Profiler, Elasticsearch and Kibana.\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark 2 using Ambari.\r\n\r\n1. Tell Spark how to talk with HBase.\r\n    ```\r\n    SPARK_HOME=/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client\r\n    cp /usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/conf/hbase-site.xml $SPARK_HOME/conf/\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n1. Create the Spark History directory in HDFS.\r\n    ```\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /spark2-history\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Fix-up the Spark logging.\r\n    ```\r\n    SPARK_HOME=/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client\r\n    cp $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties.template $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    sed -i 's/INFO/ERROR/' $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    sed -i 's/WARN/ERROR/' $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    echo \"\" >> $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    echo \"log4j.logger.org.apache.metron.profiler.spark=DEBUG\" >> $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a profile.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n    {\r\n      \"profiles\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n          \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n          \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n          \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n          \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n    }\r\n    ``` \r\n  \r\n1. Edit the Batch Profiler properties. Update the input path and add a time constraint that will filter out all of the telemetry.  Here we set the `profiler.batch.input.begin` to a time in the future.  We would expect the Profiler to not process any of the telemetry in this case.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n\r\n    spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n    spark.master=local\r\n    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=4\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n    profiler.batch.input.format=text\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.begin=2029-12-03T10:15:30Z\r\n    profiler.batch.input.end=\r\n\r\n    profiler.period.duration=15\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the Batch Profiler. Notice that in this case that even though it \"Found 945 telemetry record(s)\" it \"Generated 0 message route(s)\" because all of the messages were filtered based on the time constraint that was added.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.6.0]# cd $METRON_HOME\r\n    [root@node1 0.6.0]# bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:00 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Loading profiles from '/usr/metron/0.6.0/config/zookeeper/profiler.json'\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:00 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Loaded 1 profile(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:01 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Building 1 profile(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:01 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Loading telemetry from 'hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*'\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:09 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Found 945 telemetry record(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:10 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Generated 0 message route(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:12 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Produced 0 profile measurement(s)\r\n    ...\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:12 DEBUG BatchProfiler: 0 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    18/09/21 20:50:12 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Profiler produced 0 profile measurement(s)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Spark shell\r\n    ```\r\n    export SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION=2\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    spark-shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Find out how much telemetry you have captured and a reasonable place to 'cut' the data.  Grab the last timestamp in the list.\r\n    ```\r\n    scala> val msgs = spark.read.json(\"hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\")\r\n    msgs: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [AA: boolean, RA: boolean ... 91 more fields]\r\n\r\n    scala> msgs.select(\"timestamp\").sort().show()\r\n    18/09/21 20:54:34 WARN Utils: Truncated the string representation of a plan since it was too large.

Grab one of those timestamps and convert it to a time in UTC.  That will exclude some of the data, but not all. We should get some messages, but not all of them.  Finding this time will just depend on your data.\r\n\r\n1. Edit the Batch Profiler properties. Set the `profiler.batch.input.begin` to the time that cuts your data.  Remember that the time is specified in UTC as spelled out in the README.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n\r\n    spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n    spark.master=local\r\n    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=4\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n    profiler.batch.input.format=text\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.begin=2018-09-21T19:31:51Z\r\n    profiler.batch.input.end=\r\n\r\n    profiler.period.duration=15\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the Batch Profiler.  Here you can see that while we have 945 messages, the Profiler only created the profile with 925 of them.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 0.6.0]# bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n    ...\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:38 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Loading profiles from '/usr/metron/0.6.0/config/zookeeper/profiler.json'\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:38 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Loaded 1 profile(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:40 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Building 1 profile(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:40 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Loading telemetry from 'hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*'\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:49 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Found 945 telemetry record(s)\r\n    ... \r\n    20:58:50 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Generated 925 message route(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:52 DEBUG ProfileBuilderFunction: Building a profile for group 'hello-world-global-1708398' from 925 message(s)\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:53 DEBUG ProfileBuilderFunction: Profile measurement created; profile=hello-world, entity=global, period=1708398, value=925\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:53 DEBUG BatchProfiler: Produced 1 profile measurement(s)\r\n    ...\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:56 DEBUG BatchProfiler: 1 profile measurement(s) written to HBase\r\n    18/09/21 20:58:56 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Profiler produced 1 profile measurement(s)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You can confirm this using the REPL too.  There was 1 profile measurement written with a value of 925.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\",PROFILE_FIXED(1, \"DAYS\"))\r\n    [925]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nOriginal Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1790\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of http requests performed in the pcap panel ui component and we just unsubscribe from some of them when the component is no longer rendered on the screen. It could cause memory consumption issues. Because of the active subscriptions, the garbage collector is not able to remove these objects from the memory, however they're not needed anymore.\r\n\r\nThere's another benefit of unsubscribing from these http calls. If the user leaves the pcap tab but there are pending requests, the unsubscribe method cancels the active xhrs immediately so it won't wait for fulfilment unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nI would also refactor that part when we convert an observable to a promise. I would keep it as an observable. By doing this, we would be able to unsubscribe from it as well in the destructor method. Promises are not cancelable.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-interface/metron-alerts/src/app/pcap/pcap-panel/pcap-panel.component.ts#L70\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n\r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#ondestroy\r\n\r\n> This is the place to free resources that won't be garbage collected automatically. Unsubscribe from Observables and DOM events. Stop interval timers.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n\r\n- Collect every subscription in an object and unsubscribe from them by going through the object.\r\n- Keep the `getPackets` observable as is. Remove `toPromise()`\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nGo to the PCAP tab and start querying or just let the component figure if there are any running jobs (The latter starts an http request immediately when the component is rendered). But before making any http requests, open up the network tab and make sure you throttled the traffic by setting the connection to \"Slow 3G\" (top right corner) to let the request be in pending state for a while before it fulfils. By this, you get some extra time to change between the PCAP and the Alerts tab. If you change between the tabs and there are any http requests in pending state, they're going to be cancelled and highlighted in red color.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis change makes the PCAP config properties available via the Metron service -> Configs tab in Ambari. It also takes care of updating the `pcap.properties` file with relevant values depending on the deploy environment (single node vs. multi node vs. kerberized cluster). \r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the PCAP Config:\r\n![pcap-config-values](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20395490/45877981-21e62680-bdbd-11e8-902d-6d5a2a1bc239.png)\r\n\r\n### Testing Steps\r\n* Launch full dev\r\n* Metron PCAP service should come up successfully.\r\n* Go to Ambari -> Metron services -> Configs -> PCAP tab; change any config parameter; \r\n* Restart the required services and the config change take effect.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\nI ran the following different tests to validate the fix.\r\n\r\n#### A. Full Dev\r\n* Verified Metron PCAP service comes up successfully \r\n* Changed some of the PCAP config values from the Ambari UI, validated that this is reflected in the `pcap.properties` file upon service restart.\r\n- **Note**: I ran into [METRON-1786](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1786) during testing. I was able to resolve the issue by applying the fix in PR #1206 \r\n\r\n#### B. Multi-node Cluster\r\n* Validated that the `kafka.zk` property in `pcap.properties` is updated with the correct Broker details\r\n* Changed a PCAP service-related property (E.g. `kafka_pcap_numpackets`) and validated that the `pcap.properties` file is updated.\r\n* Changed a PCAP REST-related property (E.g. `pcap_page_size`) and validated that the `/etc/default/metron` file is updated.\r\n\r\n#### C. Kerberized Cluster\r\n* Kerberized the multi-node cluster and setup pycapa\r\n* Validated that `topology.worker.childopts` and `topology.auto-credentials` are \r\n* Ingested PCAP into the cluster\r\n* Ran queries through the PCAP panel and validated that the modified config settings are in effect (E.g. `pcap_page_size` set to 50). \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

trying to test #1201 , I fixed some issues with the Ansible install of the components required for testing packet capture.  I added instructions for how to do this in the README.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the development environment and validate that alerts are visible in the Alerts UI and run the Metron Service Check in Ambari.\r\n\r\n1. Follow the instruction in the README, to install and start all of the components for capturing packets.  Ensure that you can search and find these packets using the Alerts UI > PCAP tab.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1784\r\n\r\nTired of having to manually modify sshd_config in full dev for Centos to re-enable remote ssh and scp manually? Then this PR is for you!\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way the default image for Centos shifted the sshd_config defaults to disallow remote logins. This reverts that back to the way we had it before to make it easier to transfer files, login, etc. I also modified the role + tags so that you can run just the specific task by providing the tag - see testing example below.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nI modified the main playbook.yml for Centos such that you can also test this via ansible tags against a running instance without tearing it down completely, should you choose.\r\n\r\n- Switch to `metron/metron-deployment/development/centos6`\r\n- Run `vagrant up` if you don't already have a full dev instance running, or alternatively `vagrant --ansible-tags=\"enable-remote-ssh\" provision` to run the tag/role for an existing instance.\r\n- Verify that you can now ssh into the box.\r\n  - cd into some other directory\r\n  - ssh root@node1\r\n  - enter password and it should succeed. Previously you would get a `root@node1: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).` exception\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

was troubleshooting an issue that a user was running into with the Profiler.  The logs made it appear that a second batch of messages were being sent after a period of time, when none actually were. \r\n\r\nWe found that the second batch was actually just Storm timing out the first batch of messages and re-sending them.  This would have been simple to uncover if we had the Kafka topic, partition, and offset details of each message logged at a DEBUG level.\r\n\r\nI made those code change while debugging the issue.  I thought this might be generally useful to roll into Apache.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I think it would be generally very useful to carry forward the topic/partition/offset/timestamp information for each message in Metron.  When an error occurs with a message, we can log this specific information which makes it easy to trace the source of the problem.  Right now, we typically log the entire message, which is really not grokable and not useful for tracing the source of the problem as many messages received will look either similar or exactly the same.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Build Metron (this excludes building the UI code to save time.)\r\n    ```\r\n    mvn clean install -DskipTests -T2C -pl '!metron-interface/metron-config,!metron-interface/metron-alerts'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Alter `metron-analytics/metron-profilers/src/test/resources/log4j.properties` and uncomment the lines to turn on DEBUG logs for the Profiler.\r\n    ```\r\n    # uncomment below to help debug tests\r\n    log4j.logger.org.apache.metron.profiler=ALL\r\n    log4j.logger.org.apache.storm.windowing=ALL\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the `ProfilerIntegrationTest` and review the log messages.  You should see a message like this.\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-analytics/metron-profiler\r\n    mvn integration-test\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You should see log messages like the following.  This shows us exactly which messages from the topic are being processed.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    DEBUG ProfileSplitterBolt:151 - Received message; topic=indexing, partition=0, offset=0, kafkaTimestamp=1537276089966\r\n    ...\r\n    DEBUG ProfileSplitterBolt:151 - Received message; topic=indexing, partition=0, offset=1, kafkaTimestamp=1537276090197\r\n    ...\r\n    DEBUG ProfileSplitterBolt:151 - Received message; topic=indexing, partition=0, offset=2, kafkaTimestamp=1537276090405\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

It provides a middle step between the user interaction and the http request since the querying process can be a time consuming process and the cancel button can be pressed accidentally giving the user a hard time.\r\n\r\nYou can find the original JIRA ticket [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1760).\r\n\r\nI decided to not create this floating element from scratch but rather install a [component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-confirmation-popover) from npm which seemed to fulfil the requirements. \r\nIt uses Bootstrap behind the scenes but I slightly modified the css to make it fit to the current design. \r\nThe module has the appropriate [license](https://github.com/mattlewis92/angular-confirmation-popover/blob/master/package.json#L55) and the number of potential vulnerabilities, according to `npm audit`, is zero. \r\n\r\n**Changes included:**\r\n\r\n- Use the new component as a directive on the kill button in [pcap-panel.component.html](https://github.com/ruffle1986/metron/blob/METRON-1760/metron-interface/metron-alerts/src/app/pcap/pcap-panel/pcap-panel.component.html#L23). It's reusable and you can use it on any other elements as you wish by setting the `mwlConfirmationPopover ` directive. You can also add [different attributes](https://github.com/ruffle1986/metron/blob/METRON-1760/metron-interface/metron-alerts/src/app/pcap/pcap-panel/pcap-panel.component.html#L24-L31) to configure the behaviour of the component. I wouldn't go into details since they're pretty straightforward. Check out the [docs](https://mattlewis92.github.io/angular-confirmation-popover/docs/)!\r\n\r\n- The \"killing query process\" had been already tested before on the ui so I had to slightly change the test units accordingly. You cannot expect the same result unless you click on the \"Yes\" button on the pop confirm component. \r\n\r\n- [Override](https://github.com/ruffle1986/metron/blob/METRON-1760/metron-interface/metron-alerts/src/confirm-popover.scss) Bootstrap's styles to make it fit to the current (dark) design. \r\n\r\n- Update the package lock file due to the new dependency.\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks:\r\n![44989404-0cd06180-af8e-11e8-841f-db9517243960](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/45558381-14babc00-b840-11e8-800d-9cbbba823d3a.png)\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\nGo to the PCAP tab and start a new query by clicking on the magnifier at the right side of the filter panel. The progress bar is supposed to appear with a cancel button on the right (a button with an \"X\" on it). During the process you should be able to click on the cancel button and the pop confirm component should appear next to the button to prompt the user to solidify his/her decision or give the opportunity to change his/her mind.\r\n\r\n**In case you want to test it with real generated pcap data, you should do the following:**\r\n\r\nSet `SAMPLE_PCAP_PATH` to where you save the files on your computer. For example: \r\n`export SAMPLE_PCAP_PATH=~/Projects/Metron/code/forks/merrimanr/samplePcap`\r\n\r\nCopy the generated pcap files into full dev. To do that, make sure you’re inside your vagrant machine’s directory (e.g. centos6, etc.) and have the vagrant-scp plugin is added to vagrant. The script to install this plugin is:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-scp\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo copy the files, run this command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nls $SAMPLE_PCAP_PATH | xargs -I {} vagrant scp $SAMPLE_PCAP_PATH/{} /tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogin to full dev and upload these files to HDFS:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nvagrant ssh\r\n    su root (password: vagrant or root)\r\n    su - metron -c \"hdfs dfs -put /tmp/pcap* /apps/metron/pcap/input\"\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstall wireshark on full dev with `yum -y install wireshark`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the Storm Profiler, when timestamps are received out-of-order there can be cases where a flush signal can be either delayed or occur prematurely.  The smaller the profile period is, the more likely this is to impact the results.  This is more likely to impact things like integration tests that run with small profile period values.  I would not expect this to greatly impact the results of the Profiler under normal usage.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation of `FixedFrequencyFlushSignal` set the flush time based only on the first timestamp it sees.  With out-of-order timestamps the flush time can effectively change as additional data arrives.  \r\n\r\n* See `FixedFrequencyFlushSignalTest.testOutOfOrderTimestamps` for an example of how this logic can cause a problem\r\n\r\n* The fix in this PR tracks the min and max timestamps that have been seen.  If max > min + flushFrequency, then it is time to flush.  Otherwise, it is not time to flush.  \r\n\r\n* I added a fair number of unit tests and described in the comments what should happen.  \r\n\r\n* I also put the out-of-order check behind a `LOG.isWarnEnabled()` to reduce the cost of that validation check.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThere is not an easy way to manually test this as it requires a very specific sequence of timestamps to trigger.  I feel the updates that were made to the unit tests, along with regression testing the environment as described in the Profiler README, is sufficient.  But please advise me, if I anyone thinks additional tests should be defined.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1777\r\n\r\nThis addresses issues in the example pom for constructing the X-Pack client that we provide in the kerberos/security README. There is a bug in the shade plugin version that we had been using that appears to be fixed in the latest version, 3.2.0, whereby attempting to shade a jar with log4j-api would cause the build to fail with a nondescript error message as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-shade-plugin:2.4.3:shade (default) on project elasticsearch-xpack-shaded: Error creating shaded jar: null: IllegalArgumentException -> [Help 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nExcluding the log4j-api caused some issues when managing  the classpath between the REST application and indexing topology. Upgrading the plugin version now allows the log4j-api packages to be appropriately shaded and relocated. Note, much of this classpath drama should hopefully be ameliorated by transitioning from the Java low level client to the newer REST api provided by Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nValidated in full dev with X-Pack enabled.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nYou can manually validate this doc change by following the README and setting up X-Pack for Elasticsearch. You should continue to see data published to Elasticsearch by the indexing topology as normal. Also, the Alerts UI should be able to display alerts as normal.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the Storm Profiler, the ProfileBuilderBolt uses a separate thread to flush expired profiles.  Expired profiles are those that have not received a message for an extended period of time.  That period of time is called the profile time-to-live (profiler.ttl).  This is done to avoid potential memory leaks.\r\n\r\nThis separate thread is scheduled using `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleAtFixedRate`.  The documentation for `scheduleAtFixedRate` says that if an exception is thrown, subsequent executions will be suppressed.  We do not want this to happen.  If an exception occurs, we need to log it and continue, ensuring that expired profiles will continue to flush.\r\n\r\nI have no direct proof that this has caused a problem, but it certainly is a potential issue that should be addressed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThere is not an easy way to manually trigger this in a development environment.  I have added a unit test to exercise the problem.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

now, the user can only configure Metron's client JAAS in limited ways.  They can configure the principal name and key tab path, but few other things.  For example, I cannot easily turn on debugging today.  If I make a change to `$METRON_HOME/client_jaas.conf` to set `debug=true`, Ambari will overwrite my change when any of the topologies are restarted.\r\n\r\nWith this PR the user can now edit a template in Ambari that is used to generate `$METRON_HOME/client_jaas.conf`.  This allows user to turn on debug logs, change the service name, or add additional options required by their environment.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-09-11 at 2 12 35 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/45381641-d9b45080-b5d3-11e8-9afe-afd79c61ad4c.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1.

default, the Batch Profiler supports the text/json that Metron lands in HDFS as the source of the archived telemetry. Of course, this is not the best option for archiving telemetry in many cases and users may choose to store it in alternative formats.\r\n\r\nAlternatives like ORC should be supported when reading the input telemetry in the Batch Profiler.  The user should be able to customize the profiler based on how they have chosen to archive their telemetry.\r\n \r\n- Updated README to describe how to read alternative input formats.\r\n\r\n- Added an additional command line option that allows the user to pass custom options to the `DataFrameReader`.  This may be needed by a user depending on how the telemetry is archived.  \r\n\r\n    - For example, this allows the user to pass reader options like `quote`, `nullValue`, etc needed by [csv](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameReader.html#csv-java.lang.String...-) or `allowSingleQuote`, `allowComments` needed by [json](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameReader.html#json-scala.collection.Seq-)\r\n\r\n- Added an integration test that validates that the Batch Profiler can read ORC data.\r\n\r\n- Added an integration test that validates that the Batch Profiler can read CSV data.  I added CSV as a test so that I could validate the user providing custom options to the `DataFrameReader`.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a pull request against the `METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis is dependent on the following PRs.  By filtering on the last commit, this PR can be reviewed before the others are reviewed and merged.\r\n- [x] #1189 \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Stand-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate the environment by ensuring alerts are visible within the Alerts UI and that the Metron Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n\r\n1. Allow some telemetry to be archived in HDFS.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/* | wc -l\r\n    6916\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Shutdown Metron topologies, Storm, Elasticsearch, Kibana, MapReduce2 to free up some resources on the VM.\r\n\r\n1. Use Ambari to install Spark (version 2.3+).  Actions > Add Service > Spark2\r\n\r\n1. Make sure Spark can talk to HBase.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    SPARK_HOME=/usr/hdp/current/spark2-client\r\n    cp  /usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/conf/hbase-site.xml $SPARK_HOME/conf/\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/feature/METRON-1699-create-batch-profiler/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark#getting-started) section of the README to seed a basic profile using the text/json telemetry that is archived in HDFS.\r\n\r\n    1. Create the Profile.\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        [root@node1 ~]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n        [root@node1 ~]# cat $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json\r\n        {\r\n          \"profiles\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n              \"foreach\": \"'global'\",\r\n              \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n              \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n              \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n            }\r\n          ],\r\n          \"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n    1. Edit the Batch Profiler properties. to point it at the correct input path (changed localhost:9000 to localhost:8020).\r\n        ```\r\n        [root@node1 ~]# cat /usr/metron/0.5.1/config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n\r\n        spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n        spark.master=local\r\n        spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=8\r\n\r\n        profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n        profiler.batch.input.format=text\r\n\r\n        profiler.period.duration=15\r\n        profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n    1. Edit logging as you see fit.  For example, set Spark logging to WARN and Profiler logging to DEBUG. This is described in the README.\r\n\r\n    1. Run the Batch Profiler.\r\n        ```\r\n        $METRON_HOME/bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Stellar REPL and retrieve the profile data.  Save this result as it will be used for validation in subsequent steps.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ...\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    Functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n    ...\r\n    [Stellar]>>> window := PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"HOURS\")\r\n    [ProfilePeriod{period=1707332, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707333, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707334, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707335, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707336, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707337, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707338, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707339, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707340, durationMillis=900000}]\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\", window)\r\n    [1020, 5066, 830]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Delete the profiler data.\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"truncate 'profiler'\" |  hbase shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a new directory in HDFS for the ORC data that we are about to generate.\r\n    ```\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /apps/metron/indexing/orc\r\n    hdfs dfs -chown metron:hadoop /apps/metron/indexing/orc\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. You may need to also create this directory for Spark.  \r\n   ```\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /spark2-history\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Spark shell\r\n    ```\r\n    export SPARK_MAJOR_VERSION=2\r\n    export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hdfs\r\n    spark-shell\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Use the Spark Shell to transform the text/json telemetry to ORC.\r\n    ```\r\n    scala> val jsonPath = \"hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\"\r\n    jsonPath: String = hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*/*\r\n\r\n    scala> val orcPath = \"hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/orc/\"\r\n    orcPath: String = hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/orc/\r\n\r\n    scala> val msgs = spark.read.format(\"text\").load(jsonPath).as[String]\r\n    msgs: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[String] = [value: string]\r\n\r\n    scala> msgs.count\r\n    res0: Long = 6916\r\n\r\n    scala> msgs.write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc\").save(orcPath)\r\n\r\n    scala> spark.read.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc\").load(orcPath).as[String].count\r\n    res3: Long = 6916\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Edit `$METRON_HOME/config/batch-profiler.properties` so that the Batch Profiler consumes that telemetry stored as ORC.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# cat /usr/metron/0.5.1/config/batch-profiler.properties\r\n\r\n    spark.app.name=Batch Profiler\r\n    spark.master=local\r\n    spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=8\r\n\r\n    profiler.batch.input.path=hdfs://localhost:8020/apps/metron/orc/\r\n    profiler.batch.input.format=org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc\r\n\r\n    profiler.period.duration=15\r\n    profiler.period.duration.units=MINUTES\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Again, run the Batch Profiler again.  It will now consume the ORC data. \r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/start_batch_profiler.sh\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Again, launch the Stellar REPL and retrieve the profile data.  The data should match the previous profile data that was generated using the test/json telemetry.\r\n    ```\r\n    [root@node1 ~]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ...\r\n    Stellar, Go!\r\n    Functions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n    ...\r\n    [Stellar]>>> window := PROFILE_FIXED(2, \"HOURS\")\r\n    [ProfilePeriod{period=1707332, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707333, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707334, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707335, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707336, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707337, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707338, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707339, durationMillis=900000}, ProfilePeriod{period=1707340, durationMillis=900000}]\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\", window)\r\n    [1020, 5066, 830]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates several REST endpoints to return the state of an object on update operations.  These endpoints include:\r\n\r\n- MetaAlertController\r\n  - create\r\n  - addAlertsToMetaAlert \r\n  - removeAlertsFromMetaAlert \r\n  - updateMetaAlertStatus \r\n\r\n- UpdateController\r\n  - patch\r\n  - replace\r\n  - addCommentToAlert\r\n  - removeCommentFromAlert\r\n\r\n The general approach is to change the return type of the various Dao methods that update objects to return the updated document.  In most cases this was straightforward but did require small changes in several files due to how the Dao classes are composed and the various implementations that exist (ES, Solr, InMemory, etc).  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the most significant change was to the InMemoryMetaAlertDao classes used for REST integration testing because they were no longer sufficient after the interface change.  Before they stored a mapping between metaalerts and child alerts which worked fine when just returning a true/false on adding/removing child alerts.  With this PR the InMemoryMetaAlertDao classes now must return the full object.   As I worked through updating these methods to do this, I found myself rewriting the methods in AbstractLuceneMetaAlertUpdateDao.  Instead of doing that, I refactored the InMemoryMetaAlertDao classes to more closely match how the MetaAlertDao classes are composed and was able to reuse the implementations in AbstractLuceneMetaAlertUpdateDao.  I feel this makes the InMemoryMetaAlertDao classes smaller and easier to maintain moving forward.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Updated the various *UpdateDao interfaces and implementations to return Documents\r\n- Updated the REST services and controllers to match the new interfaces\r\n- Changed the InMemoryDao classes as described above\r\n- Updated the various unit and integration tests to verify that correct documents are returned (includes new tests in several cases)\r\n- Updated and added documentation as needed\r\n- Fixed a bug in HBaseDaoIntegrationTest.java where tables were not being cleared after each test\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIn addition to unit and integration tests passing, I have tested this in full dev with Elasticsearch.  The testing approach is the same for each endpoint listed above:  send a request and verify the document that is returned includes the expected change.  Here are a couple of examples\r\n\r\n#### Testing the patch endpoint\r\n\r\nSend a patch request:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PATCH --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"1881af3c-88df-4e72-8e81-34538b6e774b\",\r\n  \"patch\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"op\":\"add\",\r\n      \"path\":\"/newField\",\r\n      \"value\":\"newValue\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"bro\"\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/update/patch'\r\n```\r\nThe response should contain the full document along with the update, in this case a `newField` field added with a value of `newValue`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"timestamp\": 1536185190979,\r\n  \"document\": {\r\n    \"bro_timestamp\": \"1536182284.908185\",\r\n    \"ip_dst_port\": 8080,\r\n    ...\r\n    \"newField\": \"newValue\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"guid\": \"1881af3c-88df-4e72-8e81-34538b6e774b\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"bro\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Testing the metaalert create endpoint:\r\n\r\nCreate a metaalert:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"0588e788-3a91-4113-94a0-d80daec00d05\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"snort\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"group1\"\r\n  ]\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/metaalert/create'\r\n```\r\nThis should return the full metaalert along with the child alert:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"timestamp\": 1536203159546,\r\n  \"document\": {\r\n    \"average\": 10,\r\n    \"max\": 10,\r\n    \"metron_alert\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"msg\": \"'snort test alert'\",\r\n        ...\r\n        \"metaalerts\": [\r\n          \"f65e4d0e-bdad-4ac7-ab22-4cf207c3fb2e\"\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"threat:triage:score\": 10,\r\n    \"count\": 1,\r\n    \"groups\": [\r\n      \"group1\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"sum\": 10,\r\n    \"source:type\": \"metaalert\",\r\n    \"min\": 10,\r\n    \"median\": 10,\r\n    \"guid\": \"f65e4d0e-bdad-4ac7-ab22-4cf207c3fb2e\",\r\n    \"timestamp\": 1536203159546,\r\n    \"status\": \"active\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"guid\": \"f65e4d0e-bdad-4ac7-ab22-4cf207c3fb2e\",\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"metaalert\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI also tested every endpoint using the Alerts UI.  Everything should continue working as expected.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding items\r\nThere are a couple of changes I'm not quite sure about and would like some input:\r\n- Are the changes made to the InMemoryUpdateDao classes reasonable?\r\n- The case of missing documents are handled in 2 different ways as far as I can tell.  Either a null is returned or an empty Optional.  I just happened to see the null approach first so that's the pattern I followed.  However I think we may want to make this consistent and the Optional empty approach feels more appropriate to me.  What do you think?\r\n- In the MultiIndexDao, updates are performed in parallel across the different Daos.  Since we're assuming the updates should all be identical I'm returning the first one as the return value.  Is there a better approach?\r\n\r\nI've made some comments inline in this PR to highlight these and provide some context.\r\n\r\nFortunately I did not have to make any UI changes since the return value of these endpoints is ignored in most cases.  We should have a follow on task to properly update the client side code to match these new endpoints.  I believe there are a couple outstanding bugs related to displaying inconsistent results in the UI after updates.\r\n\r\nI am still working on testing with Solr and adding more code comments to add some clarity around changes that may not be obvious.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nPreliminary script that I wanted to make available for feedback.\r\n\r\nIt basically scripts out steps 4 and 5 of the RC creation process https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Release+Process\r\n\r\nBasically it will\r\n* Checkout the various repos needed during the release process\r\n* Setup branches/directories as needed\r\n* Create the release artifacts for both core metron as well as metron-bro-plugin-kafka\r\n  * This includes the tar.gz\r\n  * The signatures (SHA-256 and SHA-512.  MD5 and SHA-1 files are no longer included in the releases)\r\n  * The various supplementary files (LICENSE, CHANGES, etc).\r\n\r\nIt also has a practice run mode that won't push anything to the servers.\r\n\r\nThings that need to be improved\r\n* Need to handle only releasing core and not the plugin. Probably the other way around, too?\r\n* Error handling when things go wrong (e.g. couldn't sign artifacts).  Right now it's standard Bash \"Keep going until the script crashes\"\r\n* Input validation around version format and such?\r\n* Might be nice to tie this into maven\r\n* Apache id as username to the SVN push (may also need to have this setup for Git, but I was already good here)\r\n\r\nSidenote, the general process around the plugin is really rough and undocumented right now. We should clean that up (and preferably make it match formatting wise with the rest of Metron.  This might be things like version numbers as discussed on release threads, but even the tag naming conventions differ, along with minor things like '-' vs '_' which made doing this extra fun)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This change moves the Storm Profiler module to `metron-analytics/metron-profiler-storm`.\r\n- The core Storm Profiler package was renamed to `org.apache.metron.profiler.storm`.\r\n- All of the Profiler READMEs have been cleaned-up to contain only content relevant to each project.  The main README is now in `metron-analytics/metron-profiler-common` which links to the others as needed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Stand-up a development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Validate the development environment by ensuring alerts are visible within the Alerts UI and that the Metron Service Check in Ambari passes.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the REPL and follow the instructions in the Profiler README to [create and execute a profile in the REPL](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler#creating-profiles).\r\n\r\n1. Follow the instructions in the README to[ deploy the same profile in Storm](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-storm#getting-started).  Ensure that you can retrieve values from HBase using `PROFILE_GET`.\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR switches authentication from JDBC-based to LDAP in metron-rest.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Added test dependencies for metron-ui-security and Apache Directory to metron-rest\r\n- Removed JDBC authentication (the TestSecurityConfig class)\r\n- Updated the metron-rest integration test to set the `EMBEDDED_LDAP_PROFILE`\r\n- Added additional users to the LDAP schema as required by metron-rest tests\r\n- Suppressed Apache directory log warnings when running metron-rest tests\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAll metron-rest unit and integration tests should continue to pass.\r\n\r\n### Other Considerations\r\nAfter switching the metron-rest tests to use LDAP through metron-ui-security, I noticed a significant number of LDAP-related log warnings when running the integration tests.  As far as I can tell they are caused by missing LDAP attributes and similar issues that we probably don't care about.  I can also see the argument for wanting these logs enabled to make it easier for future contributors to find and diagnose problems when working on these tests (although it's easy enough to update the log4j.properties file if needed).

When the index topology spins-up and attempts to connect, it fails with this exception.  Simply binding to `localhost:9300` fixes this problem in the Ubuntu development environment.\r\n\r\n### The Fix\r\n\r\nI extracted the `es_hosts` variable from `single_node_vm.yml` in a way that allows each development environment (Ubuntu and CentOS) to define this value independently.  This allows CentOS to continue to use `node1:9300` as it always has and Ubuntu can use `localhost:9300` as it needs to.\r\n\r\nThis change only impacts the way the development environments are deployed.  This does not impact any of the production deployment tooling.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Test with CentOS \r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the CentOS development environment.  \r\n   ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n 1. The value of Metron > Index Settings > Elasticsearch Hosts should be \"node1\".\r\n 1. Alerts should be visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n 1. Run the service check in Ambari (Metron > Service Actions > Run Service Check).\r\n\r\n#### Test with Ubuntu\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up the Ubuntu development environment. \r\n    ```\r\n    cd metron-deployment/development/ubuntu14\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    ```\r\n 1. The value of Metron > Index Settings > Elasticsearch Hosts should be \"localhost\".\r\n 1. Alerts should be visible within the Alerts UI.\r\n 1. Run the service check in Ambari (Metron > Service Actions > Run Service Check).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
