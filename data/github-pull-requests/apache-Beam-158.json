is a fairly monolithic method for submitting a pipeline.  This PR factors out the code responsible for interacting with the job and artifact services and breaks the process down into smaller methods to make the code more reusable (prepare, stage, run).  The primary immediate impact is greater code reuse across tests:  we can now modify certain steps in tests while preserving _and testing_ the core submission code without the need to copy-paste submission code into each test.  In the future it could make it easier for `ProtableRunner` subclasses to customize the interactions with the job and artifact services. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this config in place, setting up your local repo to run yapf in a pre-commit hook is as simple as this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install pre-commit\r\npre-commit install\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore info here: https://pre-commit.com/\r\n\r\nThe great thing about pre-commit is that it supports runnings tools written in various languages, using various sanboxing strategies like virtualenvs and docker images. \r\n\r\nI'd eventually like to grow this config to include any linters or autoformatters that can be run quickly:\r\n\r\n- isort (in auto-fix mode)\r\n- pylint\r\n- spotless\r\n- mypy (maybe.  at 10s this is borderline too slow.  the daemon will be faster, but it can be prone to error)\r\n\r\nA registered pre-commit tool will only run if a modified file matches the file types and patterns

adds some plumbing that retrieves the restriction type from DoFns, gets a coder for that type, and stores it with ParDos, and ultimately it adds the restriction coder to the translated proto.

default commit deadline of 60mins does not give enough feedback to the pipeline when the spanner database is overloaded.\r\n\r\nUsing a shorter (configurable) commit deadline of 15secs, along with backoff/retry logic allows the Dataflow pipeline to take some of the load off Spanner when it gets overloaded, leading to greater overall throughput.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Implemented `show` API in `interactive_beam` module. Users can\r\ninvoke the API to introspect data through dynamic visualization for\r\ngiven PCollections immediately after they define those PCollections\r\nwithout running pipelines explicitly. API `show` always implicitly\r\nexecutes the right pipeline fragment no matter how broken/messy the\r\nin-memory state is for a notebook which makes the user flow\r\ndata-centric.\r\n2. Updated the example notebook.\r\n3. Use heading to sample data from PCollectionVisualization for\r\nprint-display when there is no frontend.\r\n4. Spell out build_pipeline_instrument to replace the abbrev. pin function.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

recent [incident](https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/20001) in GCP highlighted that we don't set autodeletion of Flink clusters created on Dataproc.\r\n\r\nThis change sets the maximum age of the cluster to 3h - after that time has passed from cluster creation, it will be deleted automatically. This way, in case of an issue with the `delete` operation, the resources won't be tied up in clusters and will not be incurring additional charges.\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

up how metrics are accessed. Instead of having them globally available, they're exclusively available on a per-bundle metrics store, which reduces the overhead of creating metrics proxies and updating. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this change moves the extraction of metrics to the FnAPI protos to the exec package, so the metrics package becomes proto agnostic. It's also forward looking, in that the metric extractors are typed with int64 to distinguish them for eventual inclusion of the float64 variants.\r\n\r\nAdds additional benchmarking around specific parts of the work of modifying metrics. Benchmark values, as always, are relative to machine, OS, and Go version.\r\n\r\nTwo areas for subsequent work:\r\nLeft as an open question are parts are how users can get access to the store (or provide an extractor) for metrics after a job. Missing for this is an equivalent \"ingestor\" for accepting metrics from an outside source for use by runners.\r\n\r\nFor a more near term CL, is actually using the v2 metrics MonitoringInfo protos instead of the legacy style. This refactoring makes it easier to support both, without the metrics package needing to be tightly coupled to the protos.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
