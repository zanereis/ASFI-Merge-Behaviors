In Mango, JSON\r\nindex keys are always compound (i.e. always arrays), but this\r\nrestriction resulted in Mango failing to match documents where\r\nthe indexed value was an object.\r\n\r\nFor example, an index with keys:\r\n\r\n[1],\r\n[2],\r\n[{\"foo\": 3}]\r\n\r\nwould be restricted such that only [1] and [2] were returned\r\nif a range query was issued.\r\n\r\nOn its own, this behaviour isn't necessarily unintuitive, but\r\nit is different from the behaviour of a non-indexed Mango\r\nquery, so the query results would change in the presence of an\r\nindex.\r\n\r\nAdditonally, it prevented operators or selectors which explicitly\r\ndepend on a full index scan (such as $exists) from returning a\r\ncomplete result set.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the maximum range boundary from [{}] to {},\r\nso all array/compound keys will be included.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCreate some documents with a field that contains a mix of value types - integers, strings, objects, nulls.\r\n\r\nWithout adding an index, run some Mango queries using range operators (`$lt`, `$lte`, `$gt`, `$gte`) and those that depend on full index scans - `$exists`, `$regex` etc. \r\n\r\nIf you then add a JSON index on the field, ensure you get the same results.\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- If this is a significant change, please file a separate issue at:\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nMango has an apparently long-standing bug whereby if an index is deemed valid for sorting a query but is not valid according to mango_idx:is_usable, the query planner would fall back to _all_docs silently, therefore ignoring the sort order specified in the query.\r\n\r\nThis reverses the index selection logic so that the list of usable indexes is generated prior to filtering them based on the sort order specified in the query.\r\n\r\nSimilar logic is applied to use_index, allowing us to generate a more specific error message when a user specifies an index which isn't valid for the current\r\nselector.\r\n\r\nThis fix exposes that the change introduced in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/816 may cause existing queries with sort fields to fail (indeed, several queries in our test suite needed fixing), so we need to consider whether this is a severe enough breaking change to warrant a major version bump.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the test suite. Test that you can run Mango queries with sort criteria.\r\n\r\n## Related Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/816\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

replicator was unnesessarily verbose during crashes. This commit\r\nreduces the vorbosity and make the error messages more helpful.\r\n\r\nMost of the replication failures happen in the startup phase when both target\r\nand source are opened. That's a good place to handle common errors, and there\r\nwere a few already handled (db not found, lack of authorization). This commit\r\nadds another other common one - inability to resolve endpoint host names. This\r\ncovers cases were there user mistypes the host name or there is a DNS issue.\r\n\r\nAlso during the startup phase, if an error occurs a stacktrace was logged in\r\naddition to the whole state of the #rep{} record. Most of the rep record and\r\nthe stack are not that useful compared to how much noise it generates. So\r\ninstead, log only a few relevant fields from #rep{} and only the top 2 stack\r\nframes. Combined with dns lookup failure this change results in almost a 4x\r\n(2KB vs 500B) reduction in log noise while providing better debugging\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nOne last source of excessive log noise the dumping of the full replicator job\r\nstate during crashes. This included both the #rep and the #rep_state records.\r\nThose have a lot of redundant information, and since they are dumped as tuples,\r\nit was hard to use and find the values of each individual field. In this case\r\n`format_status/2` was improved to dump only a selected set of field along with\r\ntheir names. This results in another 3x reduction in log noise.\r\n\r\nA separate commit replaces the silly multi-line replication start log message with\r\na shorter and more informative

an individual failed request would be tried 10 times in a row with\r\nan exponential backoff starting at 0.25 seconds. So the intervals in seconds\r\nwould be:\r\n\r\n   `0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128`\r\n\r\nFor a total of about 250 seconds (or about 4 minutes). This made sense before\r\nthe scheduling replicator because if a replication job had crashed in the\r\nstartup phase enough times it would not be retried anymore. With a scheduling\r\nreplicator, it makes more sense to stop the whole task, and let the scheduling\r\nreplicatgor retry later. `retries_per_request` then becomes something used\r\nmainly for short intermettent network issues.\r\n\r\nThe new retry schedule is\r\n\r\n   `0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4`\r\n\r\nOr about 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit when the job is stopped quicker, the user can find out\r\nabout the problem sooner from the _scheduler/docs and _scheduler/jobs status\r\nendpoints and can rectify the problem. Otherwise a single request retrying for\r\n4 minutes would be indicated there as the job is healthy and running.\r\n\r\nFixes

wait 15 seconds after last cluster configuration change, if there\r\nwere no more changes to the cluster, stop rexi buffers and servers for nodes\r\nwhich are no longer connected.\r\n\r\nExtract and reuse cluster stability check from `couch_replicator_clustering`\r\nand move it to `mem3_cluster` module, so both replicator and rexi can use it.\r\nUsers of `mem3_cluster` would implement a behavior callback API then spawn_link\r\nthe cluster monitor with their specific period values.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies the logic in rexi_server_mon as it no longer needs to\r\nhandle `{nodeup, _}` and `{nodedown, _}` messages. On any cluster membership\r\nchange it will get a `cluster_unstable` message. It then immediately spawns new\r\nservers and buffers if needed.

users had to URL encode replication IDs when using\r\n`_scheduler/jobs/<job_id>` endpoint because Mochiweb incorrectly decoded the\r\n`+` character from URL path. So users were forced to encode so that the\r\nreplicator would correctly receive a `+` after Mochiweb parsing.\r\n\r\n`+` is decoded as ` ` (space) probably because in query strings that's a valid\r\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding, but that decoding is not meant for\r\ndecoding URL paths, only query strings.\r\n\r\nNotice RFC 3986 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2\r\n\r\n`+` is a `sub-delim` (term from RFC)  and in the path component it can be used\r\nunquoted as a delimiter.\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3\r\n\r\nIndeed, the replication ID is a compound ID and `+` is a valid delimiter\r\nwhich separates the base part from the extensions.\r\n\r\nFor more details see also:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/perwendel/spark/issues/490\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1\r\n\r\nFixes

Overview\r\n\r\nJSON index selection in Mango previously deemed an index to be usable if a range scan on the first component of its compound key could be generated from the query selector.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if I had an index:\r\n\r\n[A, B]\r\n\r\nis_usable would return true for the selector:\r\n\r\n{\"A\": \"foo\"}\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because JSON indexes only index documents that contain all the fields in the index; null values are ok, but the field must be present. That means that for the above selector, the index would implicitly include only documents where B exists, missing documents where {\"A\":5} matched but field B was not present.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes is_usable so that it only returns true if all the keys in the index are required to exist by the selector. This means that in the worst case e.g. none of the predicates can be used to generate a range query, we should end up performing a full index scan, but this is still more efficient\r\nthan a full database scan.\r\n\r\nWe leave the generation of the optimal range for a given index as a separate exercise - currently this happens after index selection.\r\n\r\nPotentially we'd want to score indexes during index selection based on their ability to restrict the result set, etc.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun the mango test suite. Manually run some mango queries with/without JSON indexes and check that the results are as expected.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-14T12:37:52Z","updated_at":"2017-12-20T15:21:54Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T07:43:19Z","merged_at":"2017-09-20T07:43:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"dae81befd57940d0777402b21c05a2e3c58014d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/503f3e34afa0a68e91258ca864e70ab18e6584e2","head":{"label":"willholley:mango_json_index_selection","ref":"mango_json_index_selection","sha":"503f3e34afa0a68e91258ca864e70ab18e6584e2","user":{"login":"willholley","id":97787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley","html_url":"https://github.com/willholley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c531a13b22cc6fcea6afb342eb3f5cb315db0313","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seaml

PR is for feedback only. We've got PSE almost ready to merge so this will need to be slightly re-worked for that case which should theoretically cut down on the size of the change since the couch_bt_engine already contains most of the big diffs trying to clean up the compactor code so it can be worked on.\r\n\r\nThe crux of this optimization is to add the new append_terms and pread_terms APIs to couch_file which allows us to read and write multiple iolists to a couch_file simultaneously. This is quite helpful for things like emsort that used to write large terms to disk and then have to copy them multiple times during its decimation phase. With the multi-IO APIs we can write them all at once and then just use the file offsets during the sort phases. Attempting to do the same approach using append_term/pread_term introduces significant amounts of time to compaction due to the increased number of calls through

Overview\r\n\r\nFixes a regression where a 500 status code was returned when  no index is available to service a _find query because the  sort order does not match any available indexes. This was actually a general issue with _find errors, introduced when index selection moved from `mango_cursor.erl` to `mango_idx.erl` in https://github.com/apache/couchdb-mango/commit/01252f971bef0c8da1d78bf5a7b506b71926ce1b.\r\n\r\nIn a separate commit, I converted the index selection tests to use `unittest` assertion functions and addressed an issue with a duplicate test name.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n

Instead, log a warning\r\nthat free space could not be calculated and continue.\r\n\r\nCompaction of the database is not necessarily prevented -\r\njust that the disk space for this specific volume\r\nwon't be taken into account when deciding whether\r\nto automatically compact or not.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily to cope with edge cases arising from\r\nERL-343, whereby disksup:get_disk_data() returns invalid\r\npaths for volumes containing whitespace, and impacts Erlang 19.x and 20.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nOn MacOS, the error can be reproduced under Erlang 19 by creating a mount point with whitespace (e.g. mounting an installer) and forcing the compaction daemon to run.\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- If this is a significant change, please file a separate issue at:\r\n

This PR ensures they also run against a database with no indexes (i.e. verify \"pure\" selector behaviour) as well as against json indexes and text indexes (when available). The intention here is to catch any inconsistencies or change in results that might occur due to the index selected (clearly we don't want results to change because a user adds an index!).\r\n\r\nNote that text indexes do not currently pass these tests, but are not exercised as part of the CouchDB test suite.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nEnsure the test suite runs (CI should handle this).\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- If this is a significant change, please file a separate issue at:\r\n     https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues\r\n     and include the number here and in commit message(s) using\r\n     syntax like \"Fixes #472\" or \"Fixes apache/couchdb#472\".  -->\r\n\r\n## Related Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-08T10:56:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T10:41:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-11T10:41:06Z","merged_at":"2017-09-11T10:41:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa14e5d67650e5a484d5f4d862e17718b5b643eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/bcd9c95990ee40f14ee430f3856b9708d638f526","head":{"label":"willholley:mango_range_tests","ref":"mango_range_tests","sha":"bcd9c95990ee40f14ee430f3856b9708d638f526","user":{"login":"willholley","id":97787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Nzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley","html_url":"https://github.com/willholley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willholley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1091b5a3866be3e7cca8e21f4a289ac421a44958","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

mango json index is a filtered index, meaning that it only adds\r\ndocuments to the index that have all the fields that are defined in the\r\nindex. So when selecing an index for a query we need to make sure that\r\nall the fields defined in the index are also in the selector. Otherwise the\r\nquery could return incorrect results.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\nFor documents:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    name: \"Garren\",\r\n    location: \"South Africa\"\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    name: \"Ed\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand with an index: `[\"name, \"location\"]. If we have a query like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselector: {name: {$gte: \"E\"}}\r\n```\r\nIf it uses the above defined index it will only return the first document. Not both of them.\r\nThis PR changes it so that it will not use that index and rather use another index if there is or use _all_docs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

Overview\r\n\r\nThis adds a new optimization to the compactor to read document ids from the `OldDb#db.id_tree` during the first pass of compaction. This saves us a large amount of I/O and CPU since we aren't writing out the emsort structure. However, after the first attempt at swapping the compaction file we have to fall back to using emsort to maintain our ability to do incremental compactions if there were writes during compaction.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nmake eunit apps=couch suites=couch_db_updater_tests\r\n\r\n## Related Pull Requests\r\n\r\nOriginal PR #754 superseded by this PR cause this one

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Add `\"execution_stats\":true` to the request body and see that an `\"execution_stats\"` field is returned. Test with different index types.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new unit tests for the execution stats and existing behaviour is already well covered by tests.\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- If this

Overview\r\n\r\nWe are setting custom \"authentication_db\" in `chttpd_security_tests`, but making this change persistent in `eunit.ini` config. As a result the rest of the tests expecting this temporary database to be a proper authentication database and getting background `chttpd_auth_cache` crashes with `database_does_not_exist` exception on attempt to pull `_design/_auth` .\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```bash\r\n$ make clean\r\n\r\n$ grep authentication_db tmp/etc/*\r\ngrep: tmp/etc/*: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n$ make eunit apps=chttpd suites=chttpd_security_tests skip_deps=couch_epi\r\n ...\r\n   [done in 8.694 s]\r\n=======================================================\r\n  All 8 tests passed.\r\n\r\n$ grep authentication_db tmp/etc/*\r\ntmp/etc/default_eunit.ini:; authentication_db = _users\r\ntmp/etc/default_eunit.ini:authentication_db =

`q=8` being the default shard setting, and the Linux default of\r\n1024 file handles per process out of the box on virtually every distro,\r\nthe maximum number of databases an unmodified user environment could\r\nconceivably open simultaneously is 128. (Assuming one view/index per\r\ndatabase open as well, that number drops to 64.)\r\n\r\nWhen we hit these limits (enfile / emfile Erlang errors) CouchDB starts\r\nacting very erratically, leading to lots of scary errors and in some\r\ncases inconsistent databases. We have a recent report of mem3 dying as a\r\nresult, which took the ets tables with it - and this occurred with just\r\n32 databases, with multiple views . In another case a user reported\r\npereceived database corruption (which was actually a combination of\r\nerror reports + app-server layer errors).\r\n\r\nWhile we should recommend ulimit/fs.file-max be bumped in production\r\nuse, and consequently bumping max_dbs_open as well, we should defend\r\nagainst these kinds of errors for users who compile and install from\r\nsource (our official distribution option). max_dbs_open = 100 makes this\r\nkind of error less likely.\r\n\r\nThis also matches our couchdb-documentation repository, which still\r\nreflects a setting of 100 and was never updated to match our increased\r\n500 limit.\r\n\r\nThe alternate approach is for us to better handle enfile / emfile errors\r\nand react accordingly, but there are are a significant number of touch\r\npoints in the code where this can cause issues.","created_at":"2017-08-20T21:26:41Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T19:47:25Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T08:14:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce3038f4ad123174de0d0c2ba0477a49d01985c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"davisp","id":19929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp","html_url":"https://github.com/davisp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davisp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/d2f739dcf6307d839d010791a59d6e035448a896","head":{"label":"apache:reduce_default_max_dbs_open","ref":"reduce_default_max_dbs_open","sha":"d2f739dcf6307d839d010791a59d6e035448a896","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

This explodes when calling out to mem3 prior to the mem3 application having been started, which causes various ETS issues as the tables do not exist yet.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `couch_peruser` from `[daemons]` and adds in the necessary application and supervision logic to bootstrap this app appropriately.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n

occurred to me the other day that we already have the docid tree stored in the original database so the first pass at compaction is wasting a lot of time and IO writing out the emsort structure.

However, given the change I figured I'd at least open a feedback PR while I write the test suite for the compactor behavior.","created_at":"2017-08-16T18:51:12Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T17:19:24Z","closed_at":"2017-08-25T21:12:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a641a49afef21295393f828aac4e9d7111c9e0a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/c8025651da0e2183c5ff069bf36ea9ca01ee9c98","head":{"label":"apache:compactor-rewrite","ref":"compactor-rewrite","sha":"c8025651da0e2183c5ff069bf36ea9ca01ee9c98","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

In fact, we had two different results depending\r\non whether or not users used all_fields or explicilty specified a\r\nfield. Before if you only specified {\"name\" : \"age\", \"type : \"number\"}\r\nas a field, you could not query for {\"age\" : {\"$in\" : [2, 3]}}. You\r\nhad to explicitly add {\"name\" : \"age.[]\", \"type : \"number\"} to your\r\nlist of indexes so the $in would work.

currently checks document sizes based on Erlang's external\r\nterm size of the jiffy-decoded document body. This makes sense because that's\r\nwhat used to store the data on disk and it's what manipulated by the CouchDB\r\ninternals.\r\n\r\nHowever erlang term size is not always a good approximation of the size of json\r\nencoded data. Sometimes it can be way off (I've seen 30% off) and It's hard for\r\nusers to estimate or check the external term size beforehand. So for example if\r\nmax_document_size is 1MB, CouchDB might reject user's 600KB json document\r\nbecause Erlang's external term size of that document greater than 1MB.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue provide a module which calculates the encoded size of a json\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nIssue #659\r\n\r\n* Opened this is an alternative to https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/660 to discuss the approaches. Would have to benchmark both cases. And maybe combine them as suggested by @davisp (count number of elements if it ends up being larger than some threshold then ask jiffy to encode it).\r\n\r\n* For floating point, maybe a good minimum calculation is just to say the size is 3 (or 4 if negative). This will underestimate in most cases.  And will account for scientific notation like

if the replication id algorithm was updated, replicator would\r\nmigrate checkpoint documents but keep them in memory. They would be written to\r\ntheir respective databases only if checkpoints need to be updated, which\r\ndoesn't happen unless the source database changes. As a result it was possible\r\nfor checkpoints to be lost. Here is how it could happen:\r\n\r\n1. Checkpoints were created for current (3) version of the replicator document.\r\nAssume the replication document contains some credentials that look like\r\n'adm:pass', and the computed v3 replication id is \"3abc...\".\r\n\r\n2. Replication id algorithm is updated to version 4. Version 4 ignores\r\npasswords, such that changing authentication from 'adm:pass' to 'adm:pass2'\r\nwould not change the replication ids.\r\n\r\n3. Server code is updated with version 4. Replicator looks for checkpoints with\r\nthe new version 4, which it calculates to be \"4def...\". It can't find it, so it\r\nlooks for v3, it finds \"3abc...\" and decides to migrate it. However migration\r\nonly happens in memory. That is, the checkpoint document is updated but it\r\nneed a checkpoint to happen for it to be written to disk.\r\n\r\n4. There are no changes to the source db. So no checkpoints are forced to\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n5. User hears that the new replicator version is improved and passwords\r\nshouldn't alter the replication ids and all the checkpoints are reused. They\r\nupdate the replication document with their new credentials - adm:pass2.\r\n\r\n6. The updated document with 'adm:pass2' credentials is processed by the\r\nreplicator. It computes the v4 replication id - \"4def...\". It's the same as\r\nbefore since it wasn't affected by pass -> pass2 change. That replication\r\ncheckpoint document is not found on neither source not target. Replicator then\r\ncomputes v3 of the id to find the older version. However, v3 is affected by the\r\npasswords, so there it computes \"3ghi...\" which is different from previous v3\r\nwhich was \"3abc...\" It cannot find it. Computes v2 and checks, then v1, and\r\neventually gives up not finding checkpoint and restart the change feed from 0\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, update `find_replication_logs` to also write the migrated\r\nreplication checkpoint documents to their respective databases as soon as it\r\nfinds them.\r\n\r\nRelated to issue #689

If\r\nreplication ids change replication tasks will not be able to find their\r\nprevious checkpoints and will rewind their change feeds back to 0. For a large\r\ndatabase that could mean reprocessing millions of documents.\r\n\r\nCurrent version of replication id generation algorithm hashes the full url of\r\nthe source, target, their headers, including authorization ones as well, and a\r\nfew other things. This means when user changes their password and updates their\r\nreplication document, replication ids will change and all the checkpoint will\r\nbe invalidated.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is fairly common to upgrade services from http:// to https://.\r\nReplication endpoint URIs then typically just change their schema part\r\naccordingly. However, schema is part of the replication ID calculation, so\r\nreplication ids would then change as well.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a more robust replication id generation algorithm which can handle\r\nsome of those issues. The new algorithm:\r\n\r\n 1. Excludes source and target URI schema from the replication id calculation.\r\n As long as the host and other parts stay the same changing the schema will\r\n have no effect on the replication id.\r\n\r\n 2. Ignores inline (specified in the URL) basic authentication passwords.\r\n\r\n 3. Ignores basic authentication password even if provided in the\r\n basic authorization headers.\r\n\r\n 4. Is insensitive to switching between providing basic authentication\r\n credentials inline or in a headers section. However it includes the username\r\n used in the basic auth in the calculation. It is plausible scenario that\r\n `http://user1:pass1@a.host.com` is really a different database than\r\n `http://user2:pass2@@a.host.com`\r\n\r\nIssue

Fix flaky os daemons tests\r\n\r\nThe \"should die\" test was close to the edge of timing out. Daemon started up,\r\nslept for 1 second then died. However max_retries is 3 so the whole thing was\r\nhappening 3 times in a row. The total wait was 4 seconds, but on slow machines\r\n1 extra second was not enough for the overhead of forking the 3 processes and\r\nother setup stuff.\r\n\r\nSet restart times to 2. Hopefully 4 seconds should be enough overhead for 2\r\nrestarts.\r\n\r\nAlso adjust sleep time for the \"die quickly\" test. 1 second there might not\r\nbe enough for both restarts, so made it 2 just to be safe.\r\n\r\nAlso in a separate commit, remove unused TIMEOUT macro from os daemons module
