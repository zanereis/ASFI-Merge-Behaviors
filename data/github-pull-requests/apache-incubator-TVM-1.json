PR sets up the initial relax backend pipeline, as per thread in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/relax-target-default-pipeline.\r\n\r\nParticularly, we organized default list of passes in the default pipeline into four stages:\r\n* library dispatch passes,\r\n* legalize passes,\r\n* dataflow lower passes,\r\n* finalize passes.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is to have the default pipeline work out of the box, while users can still choose to customize the pipeline by importing these lists and combining them together, with customized passes inserted at proper locations.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we set up the initial pipelines for CUDA and LLVM backends. The pipelines for both backends will be enhanced and completed in the near future, and meanwhile the default pipeline for more backends (e.g., generic GPUs) will be added.\r\n\r\nThe existing pipeline registry system in python/tvm/relax/pipeline.py will be gradually deprecated after the establishment of the new relax backend pipeline.","created_at":"2025-02-05T20:19:25Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T08:51:36Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T08:51:36Z","merged_at":"2025-02-08T08:51:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fdf4ae46040e0867e9dab0d3f1877fbe14a21f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f66dd7ca9dbdc073e03f1dc9482c6eb38f5503cd","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2025-02-05-init-relax-pipeline","ref":"tvm-dev/2025-02-05-init-relax-pipeline","sha":"f66dd7ca9dbdc073e03f1dc9482c6eb38f5503cd","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

Description: Incorrect Assignment of `is_gpu` Property**\r\n\r\n**Summary:**\r\nIn the context of feature extraction using `meta_schedule`, the `is_gpu` property was incorrectly assigned by directly comparing the target kind name to `\"cuda\"`. This approach is not only too specific but also potentially unsafe, as it does not account for different GPU types or handle cases where the target might be undefined.\r\n\r\n**Incorrect Code:**\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/567eeed38bdbcefb68e36328af6ab1501a81d51e/src/meta_schedule/feature_extractor/per_store_feature.cc#L1395\r\n```cpp\r\nbool is_gpu = tune_context->target.value()->kind->name == \"cuda\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Problems with the Incorrect Code:**\r\n1. **Lack of Generality:** Not all GPUs use CUDA (e.g., AMD GPUs may use ROCm or OpenCL).\r\n2. **Specificity Issue:** Even on NVIDIA hardware, the target kind name isn't guaranteed to be `\"cuda\"` and can vary based on library versions or configurations.\r\n\r\n**Correct Implementation:**\r\n```cpp\r\nauto& target_keys = tune_context->target.value()->keys;\r\nbool is_gpu = std::find(target_keys.begin(), target_keys.end(), \"gpu\") != target_keys.end();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanation of Correct Code:**\r\nThe corrected code checks if `\"gpu\"` exists within the list of keys associated with the target. This method is more robust because:\r\n- It correctly identifies any target that includes `\"gpu\"` in its keys, regardless of the underlying hardware or software platform.\r\n- It avoids potential null pointer dereferencing by not directly accessing `kind->name`.\r\n- It is more flexible and can accommodate various types of GPU targets without hardcoding specific names.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-15T05:23:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-19T03:12:38Z","closed_at":"2025-01-19T03:12:38Z","merged_at":"2025-01-19T03:12:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"da2e89ac19d2986b6e7ee8874952e80dd8c72dde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7bc601d71589109bd0e7a244ff34dafa232f400e","head":{"label":"moonquekes:main","ref":"main","sha":"7bc601d71589109bd0e7a244ff34dafa232f400e","user":{"login":"moonquekes","id":102020096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBhS0AA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102020096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes","html_url":"https://github.com/moonquekes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":916960734,"node_id":"R_kgDONqe13g","name":"tvm","full_name":"moonquekes/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"moonquekes","id":102020096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBhS0AA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102020096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes","html_url":"https://github.com/moonquekes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonquekes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/moonquekes/tvm","description":"Open

form the fact that textures can be allocated over a clBuffer object and the size of backing clBuffer can be computed based on hardware image pitch alignment.\r\n\r\nThis optimizes the overall memory allocation on device and helps greately the models with large memory requirements.\r\n\r\nImprovised the graph memory planner to not differentiate buffer and texture storage tokens and reuse them across. The texture pool in OpenCL runtime is rebranded as memory pool that handles allocation for both buffer and image objects.\r\n\r\nNDArray to DeviceAPI interface is extended with AllocDataSpaceView and FreeDataSpaceView. These new API's acommodates accessing same physical memory as clBuffer / clImage

is currently not possible to access a `BlockBuilder`'s `Analyzer` instance from Python code, which would be useful e.g. when converting from front-end representations to Relax.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses that by adding a `get_analyzer` method to the Python `BlockBuilder` class. Behind the scenes, it uses the same FFI and code paths as when creating a standalone Python `Analyzer`, the only difference being where the underlying C++ instance originates from. To avoid object lifetime issues in Python code (which would be surprising given that it is a memory managed language), a C++ `BlockBuilder`'s `Analyzer` field is now a shared

`get_tile_size`.","created_at":"2024-11-21T04:38:36Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T11:38:48Z","closed_at":"2024-11-21T11:38:48Z","merged_at":"2024-11-21T11:38:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"42b1e9731e32edb80afbf9fc6ce27c62039f3452","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2606c5825e39f2590139d6e1e9b0db3236c40f8e","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-11-20-attn-fix","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-11-20-attn-fix","sha":"2606c5825e39f2590139d6e1e9b0db3236c40f8e","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

form the fact that textures can be allocated over a clBuffer object and the size of backing clBuffer can be computed based on hardware image pitch alignment.\r\n\r\nThis optimizes the overall memory allocation on device and helps greately the models with large memory requirements.\r\n\r\nImprovised the graph memory planner to not differentiate buffer and texture storage tokens and reuse them across. The texture pool in OpenCL runtime is rebranded as memory pool that handles allocation for both buffer and image objects.\r\n\r\nNDArray to DeviceAPI interface is extended with AllocDataSpaceView and FreeDataSpaceView.

has better persistence, performance, and consistent support for large files across browsers.\r\nPersonally I would like to see this caching strategy for https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't implement all required changes and hasn't been proved to work yet - I just created a PoC class implementing the `ArtifactCacheTemplate`.\r\nPotentially a problem with this approach would be that this cache uses OPFS on main thread with async APIs. A better solution could be to use Web Worker and sync file handlers - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system#manipulating_the_opfs_from_a_web_worker. Both approaches could be valid for different use cases, so I propose creating 2 new caching strategies - `opfs` and `opfs-worker`.\r\nI could finish the required work if we find it useful. Otherwise I would just move caching higher up in my stack and just do it for my specific use case.","created_at":"2024-11-10T11:53:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T21:36:45Z","closed_at":"2025-01-22T21:36:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4acb5c8610342a42b9822559f57c91c63d272df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c769e497a5ebfdd00cc0f54ebb6380abca53274c","head":{"label":"KarolNov:feat/opfs-cache","ref":"feat/opfs-cache","sha":"c769e497a5ebfdd00cc0f54ebb6380abca53274c","user":{"login":"KarolNov","id":26086781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg2Nzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26086781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov","html_url":"https://github.com/KarolNov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":886146072,"node_id":"R_kgDONNGEGA","name":"tvm","full_name":"KarolNov/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarolNov","id":26086781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDg2Nzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26086781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov","html_url":"https://github.com/KarolNov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarolNov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarolNov/tvm","description":"Open

Problem\r\nThe shape names in an ONNX model can contain expressions such as the shape `int64[batch_size,past_sequence_length + sequence_length]` of the attention mask of an LLM. In this case, the second dimension contains an expression `past_sequence_length + sequence_length` where `past_sequence_length` and `sequence_length` should be individual variables added together. However, currently, a new variable named `\"past_sequence_length + sequence_length\"` is instead created when translating the graph. \r\n\r\n# Fix\r\nI added a simple parser that creates individual size variables for the variable names and generates the resulting prim expression. Note, in order to keep the parser simple, it evaluates expressions left to right. Not accounting for operator precedence. \r\n\r\n# Test\r\nI added regression tests to verify that the onnx shape dim expression are evaluated correctly.\r\n\r\n# Additional small fixes\r\nIn the case when PrimValues are encountered in the BinaryBase, they are not always fully extracted before turning them into numpy arrays. I added an additional check that extracts the value from IntImm and FloatImm types before converting them to numpy arrays.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-05T15:10:05Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T08:01:40Z","closed_at":"2024-11-10T07:21:15Z","merged_at":"2024-11-10T07:21:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5b9f5c30bc3e1f5e1a283ed19c5440afcc45889","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6ee97fe0dd19ad52794bc2bf57900d144d1d7fcc","head":{"label":"PatrikPerssonInceptron:feature/onnx-input-shape-computations","ref":"feature/onnx-input-shape-computations","sha":"6ee97fe0dd19ad52794bc2bf57900d144d1d7fcc","user":{"login":"PatrikPerssonInceptron","id":162695502,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbKJTg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162695502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrikPerssonInceptron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":877888578,"node_id":"R_kgDONFOEQg","name":"tvm","full_name":"PatrikPerssonInceptron/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PatrikPerssonInceptron","id":162695502,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbKJTg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162695502?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrikPerssonInceptron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrikPerssonInceptron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PatrikPerssonInceptron/tvm","description":"Open

Specifically, the VisitBindingBlock_ method is not overridden for DataflowBlockNode, leading to an empty block_stack_ when it is expected to contain the current block.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, we need to override the VisitBindingBlock_ method for const DataflowBlockNode* in the StorageAllocatorBaseVisitor class. By doing so, we ensure that the block_stack_ is correctly managed when visiting dataflow blocks, similar to how it is managed for regular binding
