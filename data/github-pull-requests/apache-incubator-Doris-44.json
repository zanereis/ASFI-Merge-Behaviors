Body: Fix the problem that paimon catalog can not access to OSS-HDFS.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 problems in paimon catalog:\r\n1. Doris FE can not list paimon tables.\r\n    This is because we pass these three properties -- `fs.oss.endpoint / fs.oss.accessKeyId / fs.oss.accessKeySecret` -- to the PaimonCatalog. When PaimonCatalog get these three properties, it will use `OSSLoader` rather than `HadoopFileIOLoader`.\r\n\r\n2. Doris BE does not use libhdfs to access OSS-HDFS\r\n    This is because the `tmpLocation` in `LocationPath` does not contain `oss-dls.aliyuncs`. We should use `endpoint` to judge if user wants to access OSS-HDFS\r\n\r\nWhat's more, if you want to access OSS-HDFS with PaimonCatalog, you should:\r\n1. Download Jindo SDK: https://github.com/aliyun/alibabacloud-jindodata/blob/latest/docs/user/zh/jindosdk/jindosdk_download.md\r\n2. copy `jindo-core.jar、jindo-sdk.jar` to `${DORIS_HOME}/fe/lib` and `${DORIS_HOME}/be/lib/java_extensions/preload-extensions` directory.\r\n\r\n \n Cherry-picked from

Body: This pull request optimizes the JDBC connection and resource management in `JdbcClient` and related methods. The main changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n- **Manual Resource Closing**: Explicitly place resource acquisition and closing within a `try-catch-finally` structure. In the `finally` block, manually close resources like `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet` to ensure that resources are properly released even if an exception occurs.\r\n\r\n- **Remove try-with-resources**: All usages of `try-with-resources` have been removed, switching to manual resource management instead.\r\n\r\n- **Improve Exception Handling**: When closing resources, if an exception occurs, log a warning but do not throw a new exception. This avoids masking the original exception during the resource release phase.\r\n\r\n- **Unified Resource Management**: Ensure consistent resource acquisition and closing methods across all functions, improving code readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nFunctions modified include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- `executeStmt`\r\n- `getColumnsFromQuery`\r\n- `getDatabaseNameList`\r\n- `getJdbcColumnsInfo`\r\n- `processTable`\r\n- `getColumnsDataTypeUseQuery`\r\n\r\nThese changes enhance the robustness of the code, prevent potential resource leaks, and ensure that all JDBC connections and resources are properly closed without using `try-with-resources`. \n Cherry-picked from

Sometimes some docker doris_be consume high cpu. We want to find out it belongs to who.

Then use command 'ps -elf' can known who it belongs to.\r\n\r\nTo achive this goal,  we pass host user and uid into docker container, and let container add a new user the same with it, then run command with this new account.\r\n\r\nIf user still want to run as root in container,  they need to pass options  '--root'  when creating a new doris compose cluster.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# run as root in

pull request optimizes the JDBC connection and resource management in `JdbcClient` and related methods. The main changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n- **Manual Resource Closing**: Explicitly place resource acquisition and closing within a `try-catch-finally` structure. In the `finally` block, manually close resources like `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet` to ensure that resources are properly released even if an exception occurs.\r\n\r\n- **Remove try-with-resources**: All usages of `try-with-resources` have been removed, switching to manual resource management instead.\r\n\r\n- **Improve Exception Handling**: When closing resources, if an exception occurs, log a warning but do not throw a new exception. This avoids masking the original exception during the resource release phase.\r\n\r\n- **Unified Resource Management**: Ensure consistent resource acquisition and closing methods across all functions, improving code readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\nFunctions modified include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n- `executeStmt`\r\n- `getColumnsFromQuery`\r\n- `getDatabaseNameList`\r\n- `getJdbcColumnsInfo`\r\n- `processTable`\r\n- `getColumnsDataTypeUseQuery`\r\n\r\nThese changes enhance the robustness of the code, prevent potential resource leaks, and ensure that all JDBC connections and resources are properly closed without using `try-with-resources`.","created_at":"2024-11-01T06:28:28Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T07:15:57Z","closed_at":"2024-11-01T13:24:58Z","merged_at":"2024-11-01T13:24:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"eaaf5b4b3731c6a665165702604aabab2a7cbed8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Body: ## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n**Root Cause Analysis:**\r\nCurrently, the statistics reported by BE (Backend) nodes have higher priority than those from ANALYZE statements. During the first INSERT INTO operation, the system waits for row count reports from all tablets before updating the table statistics.\r\nSubsequent INSERT INTO operations cannot obtain the status of all tablets, so the system continues to use the statistical information from the first INSERT INTO operation. This leads to a lower estimated cost for the original table's query plan, resulting in the selection of the original table's query plan instead of the materialized view.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:**\r\nThe test case should be modified to include a larger dataset in the first INSERT INTO operation, which will increase the likelihood of utilizing the materialized view. This is because the cost estimation will better reflect the actual data distribution and size, leading to more accurate plan selection.\r\n\r\n \n Cherry-picked from

Body: ## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDeletePredicatePB should be DeleteSubPredicatePB.\r\n\r\nTest case is too ambiguous to add, since this bug is triggered by a huge random test and failed to find the minimal case. However, this fix is verified under the wild test that it does works.\r\n\r\nNote that this problem may be triggered by another bug, cuz schema in delete predicate rowset should contain column referred in delete condition. Even if we don't have this fix, this error should never happend.\r\n\r\nBut this error occurred under wild tests, means that schema in delete predicate rowset is not adaptable with delete condition. I think it is under some status that delete operation use BE tablet schema rather than schema from FE, and the former rename operation result in that status. But I failed to add a test case to reproduce, and think that by no way will it happend occurding to the related code.\r\n```\r\n(1105, 'errCode = 2, detailMessage =
