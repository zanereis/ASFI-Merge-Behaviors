you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently the statistics information about tables can only be fetched from the catalog by each given partition iteratively. Since getting statistics information from catalogs is a very heavy operation, in order to improve the query performance, we’d better provide functionality to fetch the statistics information of a table for all given partitions in one shot.\r\n\r\nBased on the manual performance test, for 2000 partitions, the cost will be improved from 10s to 2s. The improvement result is 500%.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Implementations for new added methods will be done in all classes that implement the Catalog interface. \r\n- For the concrete HiveCatalog, __HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__ will be taken care of while fetching the column statistics. - - All currently supported types for partition column will be taken into consideration.\r\n- The logic of getting TableStates in FlinkRecomputeStatisticsProgram will be optimized from calling the catalog iteratively to bulk fetch.\r\n- Logic of TableStates conversion will be consolidated into the CatalogTableStatisticsConverter class to make the domain design a little bit cleaner. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as HiveCatalogHiveMetadataTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Modify `NotifyingDefiniteKeySource` to wait for checkpoints to complete.\r\n  - Make job fail artificially, to retain completed checkpoint.\r\n  - Modify the logic of emitting elements in `SubtaskIndexFlatMapper`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as  `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T10:19:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T02:57:59Z","closed_at":"2022-08-12T08:05:36Z","merged_at":"2022-08-12T08:05:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cf71585a603866822ed0aee3978eea8d8587eee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5b5f1ea5f4f5a1d8092b7558a8c323fb034ddfa3","head":{"label":"fredia:FLINK-28626","ref":"FLINK-28626","sha":"5b5f1ea5f4f5a1d8092b7558a8c323fb034ddfa3","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo enable user to configure whether to enable sort not when it's for dynamic partition writing for HiveSource\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -  Add a configuration `table.exec.hive.dynamic-grouping.enabled` for enable dynamic grouping or not\r\n  - In `HiveTableSInk#requiresPartitionGrouping`, only both  `table.exec.hive.dynamic-grouping.enabled` and passed parameter are true,  return true and set `dynamicGroupingEnabled` = `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThe test in [HiveTableSinkITCase](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20419/files#diff-7a502ee8a516dc70a49546e1b44d699ca3e82f527ebb01f5665aa0cd9294f5b0R445) \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T10:10:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T05:26:23Z","closed_at":"2022-08-10T05:26:23Z","merged_at":"2022-08-10T05:26:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"22dba69f16d69e8235ec873d90e66af0558b120d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b342f3944a1f7095234d7d8a9e32ec45eb0e420d","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-28774","ref":"FLINK-28774","sha":"b342f3944a1f7095234d7d8a9e32ec45eb0e420d","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Introduce the session related api in sql gateway*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce session related handlers and message headers*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for session related apis*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T08:44:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-04T02:04:29Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T02:04:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc0c5f9fdfc3e24d22d446dc5f4cf030513bd288","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fc47ab67070d9b720059654a18b6dc3cfd7057d4","head":{"label":"WencongLiu:dev_session_apis","ref":"dev_session_apis","sha":"fc47ab67070d9b720059654a18b6dc3cfd7057d4","user":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486167626,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPpUSg","name":"flink","full_name":"WencongLiu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T08:30:00Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T10:08:34Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T08:36:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a9bbce65e19310d8e7c9bf49343428221a816af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9b20628c7276ac4830aefdf5e4100d6f6071a2b1","head":{"label":"liuyongvs:fix_RowTimeMiniBatchAssginerOperator_chain","ref":"fix_RowTimeMiniBatchAssginerOperator_chain","sha":"9b20628c7276ac4830aefdf5e4100d6f6071a2b1","user":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278584612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzg1ODQ2MTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyongvs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyongvs","id":6316753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTY3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6316753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyongvs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyongvs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes Hive source implements SupportsDynamicFiltering, so that batch jobs may benefit from dynamic partition pruning on partitioned hive tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce DynamicFileEnumerator interface.\r\n  - Make hive source implements SupportsDynamicFiltering.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added unit tests. More integration tests with dynamic filtering hive source will be added in future PRs.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T08:01:53Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T09:40:19Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T09:40:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9861eedd56487b17e288c7737ca2ee3495aebd0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7e81a8c4edd926e662a5ee1bfb0f0ff85e486bb8","head":{"label":"pltbkd:FLIP-248-hive","ref":"FLIP-248-hive","sha":"7e81a8c4edd926e662a5ee1bfb0f0ff85e486bb8","user":{"login":"pltbkd","id":86285274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd","html_url":"https://github.com/pltbkd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":379169589,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzkxNjk1ODk=","name":"flink","full_name":"pltbkd/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pltbkd","id":86285274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd","html_url":"https://github.com/pltbkd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pltbkd/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo make Hive dialect supports `ADD JAR`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -  Parse add jar command in HiveDialect and convert it to `AddJarOperation`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThe test in `Hivedialect#testAddCommand`in to make sure the \"ADD JAR\" can be converted to AddJarOperation. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? N/A\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-02T06:56:27Z","updated_at":"2022-08-06T15:35:15Z","closed_at":"2022-08-06T15:35:14Z","merged_at":"2022-08-06T15:35:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"1a094eb3619e9696759eaf1a5a0dad4e6852bb12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3d1c9d0c4bcff2c2be65e4eeca33fcd63326684f","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-28772","ref":"FLINK-28772","sha":"3d1c9d0c4bcff2c2be65e4eeca33fcd63326684f","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo verify the correctness of speculative execution, we should enabled it in AdaptiveBatchScheduler TPC-DS e2e tests, which runs a lot of different batch jobs and verifies the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nenabled speculative execution in AdaptiveBatchScheduler TPC-DS e2e tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo verify the correctness of speculative execution, we should enabled it in AdaptiveBatchScheduler TPC-DS e2e tests, which runs a lot of different batch jobs and verifies the result.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nenabled speculative execution in AdaptiveBatchScheduler TPC-DS e2e tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request will use `deleteRange` to optimize the `clear` method of `RocksDBMapState`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nReplace RocksDB's `Iterator` with `deleteRange`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as \r\n\r\n- org.apache.flink.contrib.streaming.state.EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackendTest#testMapStateClear\r\n- org.apache.flink.runtime.state.StateBackendTestBase#testMapState\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor ChangelogPeriodicMaterializationSwitchStateBackendITCase#testSwitchFromDisablingToEnablingInClaimMode.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - replace `InfiniteIntegerSource` with `ControlledSource`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *`ChangelogPeriodicMaterializationSwitchStateBackendITCase`*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T07:41:32Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T03:21:06Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T03:21:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54be41b8e827663192cf8c4d566dd9693132ba3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4b047b5e0af4ca35118a9788853a1f2424cfd8b7","head":{"label":"chaozwn:FLINK-28151","ref":"FLINK-28151","sha":"4b047b5e0af4ca35118a9788853a1f2424cfd8b7","user":{"login":"chaozwn","id":51357674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn","html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325162057,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjUxNjIwNTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"chaozwn/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chaozwn","id":51357674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn","html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement getSchemas in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement listDatabases in the SqlGatewayService.\r\n  - Implement GetSchemas in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added list all databases in the  `SqlGatewayServiceITCase`.\r\n  - Use jdbc to fetch all schemas (matching name pattern) within given catalog  in the `HiveServer2EndpointITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T06:56:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T14:32:17Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T14:32:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96fd50815269ad7ab305cfd123e97140ea56a66d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2fad48a8e75ac9b470efadf0fbf037f9c7b89353","head":{"label":"yuzelin:list-schemas","ref":"list-schemas","sha":"2fad48a8e75ac9b470efadf0fbf037f9c7b89353","user":{"login":"yuzelin","id":33053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin","html_url":"https://github.com/yuzelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517571327,"node_id":"R_kgDOHtmC_w","name":"flink","full_name":"yuzelin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuzelin","id":33053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin","html_url":"https://github.com/yuzelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuzelin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request adding more details about state latency tracking in the metric documentation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Added \"State Access Latency\" in metric.md\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial work about documentation without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-01T05:36:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T10:18:06Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T10:18:06Z","merged_at":"2022-08-01T10:18:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"aae0462cb398f5c58c46a769b25b06a7fdd15d1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20400/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20400/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20400/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e46bf16c6c26aad7ed92efa98f52904b1174fabf","head":{"label":"masteryhx:FLINK-24787","ref":"FLINK-24787","sha":"e46bf16c6c26aad7ed92efa98f52904b1174fabf","user":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436096625,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf5OcQ","name":"flink","full_name":"masteryhx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen rocksdb statebackend is used and state.backend.incremental enabled, flink will figure out newly created sst files generated by rocksdb during checkpoint, and read all the states from rocksdb and write to files during savepoint.\r\n\r\nWhen state.backend.incremental disabled, flink will read all the states from rocksdb and generate state files in checkpoint and savepoint. This makes sense in savepoint, cause user can take a savepoint with rocksdb statebackend and then restore it using another statebackend, but in checkpoint, deserialisation and serialisation of state results in performance loss.\r\n\r\nIf the native rocksdb snapshot is introduced in full snapshot, theoretically better performance can be achieved. At the same time, savepoint remains the same as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes the full snapshot in non-incremental checkpointing when rocksdb statebackend is used , sst files will be persisted rather than serialised states for better performance. Savepoint remains the same as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *FullSnapshotRocksDbTtlStateTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no) \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no) \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nthis is two main parts of the parent issue FLINK-27849\r\n1. FLINK-28570: Introduces a StreamNonDeterministicPlanResolver to validate and try to solve (lookup join only) the non-deterministic updates problem which may cause wrong result or error\r\n which introduce a new optimizer option: \"table.optimizer.non-deterministic-update.handling\" with default value  `IGNORE` to keep the compatibility. When user cares about the effects of non-deterministic updates, the option can be set to `TRY_RESOLVE`, then the inner `StreamNonDeterministicPlanResolver` will validate if there's any non-deterministic updates which may cause wrong result or error, and also try to eliminate the non determinism generated by lookup join node by adding materialization to a new physical lookup joins operator, will raise an error if there still exists other non-deterministic beside lookup join\r\n\r\n2. FLINK-28568:  Implements a new lookup join operator (sync mode only) with state to eliminate the non determinism\r\n which is a followup issue of FLINK-28570 to finish the materialization support in runtime, note that only sync lookup function is supported for now due to some runtime limitation (async lookup join based on the AsyncWaitOperator which has operatror state, and the materialization requirement here needs a keyed state, so unless we invent a new KeyedAsyncWaitOperator here, the work can not be done for now)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* add 'table.optimizer.non-deterministic-update.handling' to OptimizerConfigOptions\r\n* implement a StreamNonDeterministicPlanResolver to visit all stream physical node and try to rewrite lookup join node with materialization enabled\r\n* add new tests and update existing tests to best effortly covering the new logic \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nNonDeterministicDagTest KeyedLookupJoinHarnessTest and existing tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR supports using `CsvBulkWriter` in PyFlink. Although `CsvBulkWriter` is not directly documented, Java users still can use it in DataStream jobs, while for Python users, it's not possible without extra wrapping, cause there's no a explicit factory class.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- add utility function to create factory for `CsvBulkWriter`\r\n- add preprocessing to convert Row to RowData before sinking to CSV\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- `FileSinkCsvBulkWriterTests` in test_file_system.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe current fabric8 kubernetes-client(5.5.0) will swallow the KubernetesClientException and then the next renewing could not work properly until reach the deadline. This will be a serious problem because one time failure of renewing leader annotation will cause leadership lost. And refer the [issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/4246), the said issue got progressed in the latest version 5.12.3\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpgrade the fabric8 version to 5.12.3 and the associated dependencies to the right versions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - regression test needed for the associated parts in flink-k8s component.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-29T03:19:09Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T02:58:35Z","closed_at":"2022-08-10T02:58:35Z","merged_at":"2022-08-10T02:58:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2ec01241c5e5bcb860180dae5c0a660bc816926","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20390/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20390/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20390/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/089a229ba07288b929fd7779a9be9946e4f68449","head":{"label":"bzhaoopenstack:FLINK-28481","ref":"FLINK-28481","sha":"089a229ba07288b929fd7779a9be9946e4f68449","user":{"login":"bzhaoopenstack","id":11386522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11386522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack","html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406681532,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY2ODE1MzI=","name":"flink","full_name":"bzhaoopenstack/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bzhaoopenstack","id":11386522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11386522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack","html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn FLIP-248 [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-248%3A+Introduce+dynamic+partition+pruning](url), we aims to support dynamic filtering which can filter unnecessary partitions in the batch execution phase. See FLIP-248 for details of implementation. In this pr,  we aims to support this function in table planner by implementing multiple rules to match possible dynamic filtering in sql statements. The details are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Implemented basic abstract rules `DynamicFilteringRuleBase`， which provided some basic methods for matching dynamic filtering.\r\n- Eight different rules extended `DynamicFilteringRuleBase` are provided, which used to match different patterns. Eg. `DynamicFilteringRule1` is used to match the pattern that join right part is a fact table, and `DynamicFilteringRule3` is used to match join right part is a fact table which have an exchange node.\r\n- A new scan table source named `BatchPhysicalDynamicFilteringTableSourceScan` is provided, which can be used to receive filter condition of dim table to dynamic filtering partitions.\r\n- Adding Plan test `DynamicFilteringRuleTest` to cover multi scans, like different dynamic filtering patterns, different join types and some sepcial unsupported cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces new interfaces that allows to use Full cache as `LookupFunctionProvider`. Interface list:\r\n\r\n- `FullCachingLookupProvider`\r\n- `CacheReloadTrigger`\r\n\r\nCacheReloadTrigger provides customizable way when to trigger cache reload operation. There are 2 built-in triggers:\r\n\r\n- `PeriodicCacheReloadTrigger` - cache is reloaded with fixed intervals without initial delay\r\n- `TimedCacheReloadTrigger` - cache is reloaded at specified time with fixed intervals multiples of one day\r\n\r\nAlso there are introduced common options for connectors that will support Full caching lookup join.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add interfaces FullCachingLookupProvider and CacheReloadTrigger\r\n- Implement reload triggers PeriodicCacheReloadTrigger and TimedCacheReloadTrigger\r\n- Add common SQL options for Full caching lookup join\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added unit tests for the newly added `PeriodicCacheReloadTrigger` and `TimedCacheReloadTrigger`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (FLIP docs + JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T12:03:48Z","updated_at":"2023-12-08T10:04:45Z","closed_at":"2022-08-04T14:54:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39d0260fefc15460ae1f112f7a70f7afe0ffbe98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/00a38cfd30e15ce34b7ab61ba7058c3fa974f36b","head":{"label":"SmirAlex:FLINK-28419","ref":"FLINK-28419","sha":"00a38cfd30e15ce34b7ab61ba7058c3fa974f36b","user":{"login":"SmirAlex","id":52520363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52520363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex","html_url":"https://github.com/SmirAlex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":516610685,"node_id":"R_kgDOHsrafQ","name":"flink","full_name":"SmirAlex/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SmirAlex","id":52520363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52520363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex","html_url":"https://github.com/SmirAlex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SmirAlex/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up step of FLIP-168 and FLIP-224, the Flink Web UI now needs to be enhanced to display the related information if the speculative execution mechanism is enabled. This PR enhances the web UI for the newly adopted API changes.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- show blocked free slots and blocked TM in overview\r\n- show blocked badge in TM list and detail pages\r\n- enable expanded rows of other concurrent attempts for subtasks\r\n- others: replace loading icon with text to avoid spin animation bottleneck\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T10:01:21Z","updated_at":"2023-01-04T02:25:17Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T05:20:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"982a1ae4a3c76d68500f62c477bbcb2e4a382a8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025479,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1NDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/WebFrontend","name":"component=Runtime/WebFrontend","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/77ceb1e4fc067f423dd8e64b0ba4e6e1e77f31cb","head":{"label":"yangjunhan:FLINK-28589","ref":"FLINK-28589","sha":"77ceb1e4fc067f423dd8e64b0ba4e6e1e77f31cb","user":{"login":"yangjunhan","id":50307523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA3NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50307523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304250838,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQyNTA4Mzg=","name":"flink","full_name":"yangjunhan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangjunhan","id":50307523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA3NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50307523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan/flink","description":"Apache

You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTranslate:\r\nConnectors/Kinesis page to deprecate old sink (docs/content/docs/connectors/datastream/kinesis.md)\r\nMetrics page with new sink metrics (docs/content/docs/ops/metrics.md) - only the section about Kinesis\r\ninto Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\ntranslate flink/docs/content/docs/connectors/datastream/kinesis.md (unchanged) and put the translated document\r\nflink/docs/content.zh/docs/connectors/datastream/kinesis.md (changed)\r\ntranslate flink/docs/content/docs/ops/metrics.md (unchanged) and put the translated document\r\nflink/docs/content.zh/docs/ops/metrics.md (changed, only the section about Kinesis)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)    no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)    no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)    no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T09:49:53Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T09:43:32Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T09:43:32Z","merged_at":"2022-07-29T09:43:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"6476c6db8baa57122fc4c605db9a1aeb4b213a20","assignee":{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1a8a09f47022b8c720752b7fecf1b72ace9726d8","head":{"label":"DavidLiu001:translate_Kinesis","ref":"translate_Kinesis","sha":"1a8a09f47022b8c720752b7fecf1b72ace9726d8","user":{"login":"DavidLiu001","id":106014907,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlGouw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106014907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidLiu001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517919139,"node_id":"R_kgDOHt7Row","name":"flink","full_name":"DavidLiu001/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DavidLiu001","id":106014907,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlGouw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106014907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidLiu001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nImprove the logic for enumerating Hive data files to splits instead of always use default split size to enumerate split.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add extra code to [set the max split size](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20377/files#diff-7efab252a2e97741bb9e1711074920a0bb68bb8ca27758f315b6af51075640f8R105) insteading of always use default max split size.\r\n  - Put the configuration  releated  to the JobConf since we will need them in [HiveSourceFileEnumerator.java](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20377/files#diff-7efab252a2e97741bb9e1711074920a0bb68bb8ca27758f315b6af51075640f8)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces operators to support dynamic filtering. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce coordinatorListeningID in SourceCoordinator to listen to events from other coordinators.\r\n  - Introduce DynamicFilteringData and the DynamicFilteringDataCollectorOperator to build and distribute the data.\r\n  - Introduce ExecutionOrderEnforcerOperator to ensure the source with dynamic filtering is executed after the DynamicFilteringData is collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added new tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T07:50:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-07T02:33:43Z","closed_at":"2022-08-07T02:33:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1568aef5d6c6ea00049a0af38a124da02d60beb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7754c4efa30ed5d65f995335f50da83e793a4689","head":{"label":"pltbkd:FLIP-248-runtime","ref":"FLIP-248-runtime","sha":"7754c4efa30ed5d65f995335f50da83e793a4689","user":{"login":"pltbkd","id":86285274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd","html_url":"https://github.com/pltbkd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":379169589,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzkxNjk1ODk=","name":"flink","full_name":"pltbkd/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pltbkd","id":86285274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2Mjg1Mjc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86285274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd","html_url":"https://github.com/pltbkd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pltbkd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pltbkd/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the problem that the checkpoint details page of the Flink Dashboard shows blank after the job triggers savepoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Correct the problem that the checkpoint size shown in the Checkpoint Tab should be read from `lastest.savepoint.checkpointed_size`. (Following figure shows the return value of the checkpoint API.)*\r\n \r\n<img width=\"911\" alt=\"JSON value return by the checkpoint API\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19743175/181178391-f80fc4f1-c814-4010-8e2f-2f6029f1ccec.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T06:46:37Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T11:08:45Z","closed_at":"2022-07-27T11:08:31Z","merged_at":"2022-07-27T11:08:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"be4e0fe050b6f71e8522311e598e4d9997134d49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025479,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1NDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/WebFrontend","name":"component=Runtime/WebFrontend","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9f28d13cdfad75c58dc1687673ff641576c7488e","head":{"label":"yuchen-ecnu:FLINK-28577","ref":"FLINK-28577","sha":"9f28d13cdfad75c58dc1687673ff641576c7488e","user":{"login":"yuchen-ecnu","id":19743175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzQzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19743175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchen-ecnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":518129640,"node_id":"R_kgDOHuIH6A","name":"flink","full_name":"yuchen-ecnu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuchen-ecnu","id":19743175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzQzMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19743175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu","html_url":"https://github.com/yuchen-ecnu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuchen-ecnu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuchen-ecnu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR closes FLINK-28698, which it fix the order of aggregated metrics status durations in order to follow the natural task state transitions: CREATED, SCHEDULED, DEPLOYING, INITIALIZING, RUNNING\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange the table row order to CREATED, SCHEDULED, DEPLOYING, INITIALIZING, RUNNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroducing adaptive hash join for batch sql hash join.  Adaptive hash join integrates the advantages of hash join and sort merge join according to the characteristics of runtime data. The adaptive hash join will try to use hash join strategy firstly, if failed, fall back to sort merge join, this can improve the stability of hash join.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve the problem of data skew, or too much data in the hash table, so here introduce one strategy fallback to sort merge join:\r\n\r\n1. If some partitions are spilled to disk more than three times in the process of hash join.\r\n\r\nThis commit has implemented the main process of adaptive hash join, but regarding to the long key type, due to the physical operator is generated by codegen, so I will append another commit to support it.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we will support more flexible adaptive hash join strategy, for example, in the process of building a hash table, if the size of data written to disk reaches a certain threshold, fallback to sort merge join in advance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *If the data spill to disk exceeds the threshold {@code TABLE_EXEC_HASH_JOIN_SPILL_THRESHOLD} in the process of build hash table, fallback to sort merge join*\r\n  - *If some partitions are spilled to disk more than three times in the process of hash join, fallback to sort merge join*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added uint tests in `LongHashTableTest` and `BinaryHashTableTest`*\r\n  - *Added uint tests in `Int2AdaptiveHashJoinOperatorTest`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Use fixed hive server2 version. Because the different version of hiveserver2 has different interfaces. Currently, the hive connector uses reflection to get the classes in the hive jar with different versions. However, it doesn't work for the hiveserver2 endpoint because the hiveserver2 endpoint needs to implement the interface in the dynamic hive jars. To solve this, we may need to introduce a Proxy to delegate the different requests to a hive-free server.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI have run `mvn clean install -T 4 -DskipTests -Pskip-webui-build -Phadoop3-tests,hive3` in my local environment. The problem in the issue doesn't appear. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\n\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\n\n## Contribution Checklist\n\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\n  \n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\n\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\n  \n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\n\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\n  \n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\n\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\n\n\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\n-->\n\n## What is the purpose of the change\n\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\n\n\n## Brief change log\n\n*(for example:)*\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\n\n\n## Verifying this change\n\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\n\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\n\n*(or)*\n\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\n\n*(or)*\n\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\n\n*(example:)*\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\n\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\n\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\n\n## Documentation\n\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\n","created_at":"2022-07-25T17:03:04Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T17:04:04Z","closed_at":"2022-07-25T17:03:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0696ed9e02e81a43d111bd5c133129729210bd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8e683db8dbfe59eb2b898c599f4d2091bbd49e77","head":{"label":"bobby-richard-sed:postgres-array-support","ref":"postgres-array-support","sha":"8e683db8dbfe59eb2b898c599f4d2091bbd49e77","user":{"login":"bobby-richard-sed","id":63018525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDE4NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63018525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed","html_url":"https://github.com/bobby-richard-sed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":504302678,"node_id":"R_kgDOHg8MVg","name":"flink","full_name":"bobby-richard-sed/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bobby-richard-sed","id":63018525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDE4NTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63018525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed","html_url":"https://github.com/bobby-richard-sed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bobby-richard-sed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bobby-richard-sed/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate copyright year to 2014-2022 in NOTICE files\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: ( no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: ( no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-25T14:39:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T07:01:37Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T07:01:37Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T07:01:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"803027a152781230f743a90054f97d333ba8cabb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c71c4fc22dd2302f82ed11a57f147fd5ffb78b8a","head":{"label":"libenchao:28676-update-notice-copyright-year","ref":"28676-update-notice-copyright-year","sha":"c71c4fc22dd2302f82ed11a57f147fd5ffb78b8a","user":{"login":"libenchao","id":4471524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4471524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao","html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":162708629,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjI3MDg2Mjk=","name":"flink","full_name":"libenchao/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"libenchao","id":4471524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4471524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao","html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, if one output of an upstream job vertex is consumed by multiple downstream job vertices, the upstream vertex will produce multiple dataset. For blocking shuffle, it means serialize and persist the same data multiple times. This ticket aims to optimize this behavior and make the upstream job vertex produce one dataset which will be read by multiple downstream vertex.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Produce one intermediate dataset for multiple consumer job vertices consuming the same data.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, one intermediate dataset can only be consumed by one downstream consumer vertex. If there are multiple consumer vertices consuming the same output of the same upstream vertex, multiple intermediate datasets will be produced. We can optimize this behavior to produce only one intermediate dataset which can be shared by multiple consumer vertices. As the first step, we should allow multiple downstream consumer job vertices sharing the same intermediate dataset at scheduler side. (Note that this optimization only works for blocking shuffle because pipelined shuffle result partition can not be consumed multiple times)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Allow multiple downstream consumer job vertices sharing the same intermediate dataset at scheduler side\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo support NTILE function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -  Add implementation for [NTILEAggFunction.java](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20348/files#diff-e28b9a84f2fe96c5568a9469678f927139dc6addee090020c9912ffd38d25e33) in the [commit](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20348/commits/56cd4b7233b125b4327ff4f5b0aa6ceaa776965c)\r\n  - Fix using wrong constant for overwindow in the [commit](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20348/commits/f6f1aa0b1269decc43eb368ce50b5ec3619dfddf)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nUT in [testNTILE](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20348/files#diff-81346deaed0bf56b2b392761a0be36cb3d25ace2c6999b7a1c22f797e7c07615R2812), [testOverWindowWithConstants3]([.../src/test/scala/org/apache/flink/table/planner/plan/batch/sql/agg/OverAggregateTest.scala](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20348/files#diff-6a5a747091df9819064c631e0ad1faf17aad64916a44481fc9fac2efb8cb8248))\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo support PERCENT_RANK function\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Add implementation for [PERCENT_RANK](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20347/files#diff-50dfaea3dd3c4981b6d098388215860d0142172bc32c1930ad73e37715647642)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n[UT](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20347/files#diff-81346deaed0bf56b2b392761a0be36cb3d25ace2c6999b7a1c22f797e7c07615R2812) for PERCENT_RANK\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-23T07:39:51Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T13:43:08Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T13:43:08Z","merged_at":"2022-08-05T13:43:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4df097513be1ec0b82b5a110f93606388747765","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/af4dca690054478821922a7a754fc4daa4476953","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-27620-1","ref":"FLINK-27620-1","sha":"af4dca690054478821922a7a754fc4daa4476953","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake necessary changes for KDS connector to survive stop-with-savepoint workflow. Based on:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17189/ \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*   Reenable and harden FlinkKinesisITCase\r\n*   Fix DataStream#executeAndCollect for stop with savepoint without drain\r\n*   Avoid another source of interruptions during shutdown of Kinesis consumer\r\n*   Ensure EFO version of the connector stops gracefully \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* All covered by the newly expanded FlinkKinesisITCase\r\n* EFO scenarios verified locally against custom AWS account and real Kinesis stream\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (~yes~ / *no*)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (~yes~ / *no*)\r\n  - The serializers: (~yes~ / *no* / ~don't know~)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (~yes~ / *no* / ~don't know~)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (~yes~ / *no* / ~don't know~)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (~yes~ / *no* / ~don't know~)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (~yes~ / *no*)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (*not applicable* / ~docs / JavaDocs / not documented~)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T09:56:23Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T08:58:42Z","closed_at":"2022-07-25T08:58:42Z","merged_at":"2022-07-25T08:58:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bbf3194dc3816dcaa6a76ed7adf0fd228b16293","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0cc29ffc795b2b77e8bd3187571f3974e6eed686","head":{"label":"dzikosc:FLINK-23528-fix-master","ref":"FLINK-23528-fix-master","sha":"0cc29ffc795b2b77e8bd3187571f3974e6eed686","user":{"login":"dzikosc","id":68543412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTQzNDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68543412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc","html_url":"https://github.com/dzikosc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":509386962,"node_id":"R_kgDOHlyg0g","name":"flink","full_name":"dzikosc/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dzikosc","id":68543412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTQzNDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68543412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc","html_url":"https://github.com/dzikosc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dzikosc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dzikosc/flink","description":"Apache

results in Null Pointer Exception\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAllow flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/table/ReducingUpsertWriter.WrappedContext to set timestamp with NULL value in order to avoid NPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/table/ReducingUpsertWriter.java\r\n  - flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/table/ReducingUpsertWriterTest.java\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *flink-connectors/flink-connector-kafka/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/connectors/kafka/table/ReducingUpsertWriterTest::testWriteDataWithNullTimestamp()*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T08:46:27Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T18:53:25Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T18:53:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59f493786122f5fcfe4f2ed05442d440e7b75cd1","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5a66165ebc9bc2824afcd3ab13b0fd0b62bd66e3","head":{"label":"paul8263:FLINK-25916","ref":"FLINK-25916","sha":"5a66165ebc9bc2824afcd3ab13b0fd0b62bd66e3","user":{"login":"paul8263","id":7007327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDczMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7007327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263","html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321848988,"n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd `translate(expr, from, to)` SQL function.\r\nExamples:\r\n```sql\r\n> SELECT translate('AaBbCc', 'abc', '123');\r\n A1B2C3\r\n> SELECT translate('AaBbCc', 'abc', '1');\r\n A1BC\r\n> SELECT translate('AaBbCc', 'abc', '');\r\n ABC \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add translate method to SqlFunctionUtils.java\r\n- Add related expression, convert rule, and code gen.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as ScalarFunctionsTest#testTranslate.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T08:42:09Z","updated_at":"2024-08-03T15:01:12Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20342/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20342/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20342/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/623ef1791ef16a72ec1a69f2df638190300985e0","head":{"label":"zzzzzzzs:FLINK-26939","ref":"FLINK-26939","sha":"623ef1791ef16a72ec1a69f2df638190300985e0","user":{"login":"zzzzzzzs","id":25766626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25766626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":390586620,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTA1ODY2MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzzzzzzs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzzzzzzs","id":25766626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25766626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T03:47:18Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T03:47:48Z","closed_at":"2022-07-22T03:47:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51656a2aba242f762bdd2d0e535297b93b889dd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b6f5aac1b0ea615b2503ad729cea2e6697e69865","head":{"label":"Yuntao-Wu:master","ref":"master","sha":"b6f5aac1b0ea615b2503ad729cea2e6697e69865","user":{"login":"Yuntao-Wu","id":14227099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI3MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14227099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuntao-Wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270258771,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzAyNTg3NzE=","name":"flink","full_name":"Yuntao-Wu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yuntao-Wu","id":14227099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI3MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14227099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu","html_url":"https://github.com/Yuntao-Wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yuntao-Wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yuntao-Wu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange the abstract method's parameter naming in AsyncSinkWriter and AsyncSinkWriterTest\r\n\r\nFrom  Consumer<List<RequestEntryT>> requestResult\r\nto  Consumer<List<RequestEntryT>> requestToRetry\r\n\r\nThis is because the consumer here is supposed to accept a list of requests that need to be retried.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nflink-connectors/flink-connector-base/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/connector/base/sink/writer/AsyncSinkWriter.java\r\nflink-connectors/flink-connector-base/src/test/java/org/apache/flink/connector/base/sink/writer/AsyncSinkWriterTest.java\r\nJust rename the parameter of requestResult to requestToRetry\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)     no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)    no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)    no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)    no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T03:25:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T07:38:15Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T04:57:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c566ed4320bf5ea6feb1f082d03fa2c61335a6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dannycranmer","id":4950503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4950503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer","html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9bcd71acf5c72dc681a8d707f50632f6628a6a0f","head":{"label":"DavidLiu001:fix-flink-27536","ref":"fix-flink-27536","sha":"9bcd71acf5c72dc681a8d707f50632f6628a6a0f","user":{"login":"DavidLiu001","id":106014907,"node_id":"U_kgDOBlGouw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106014907?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidLiu001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidLiu001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7ea31cfcf360bc40b2445c72aae14746577aff9d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/p

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn local-global streaming tasks, the` LOCAL` phase is classified as `POINTWISE` by default in some versions. And in the case of data skew, the following phenomena will occur.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10743150/180346883-5bf24a42-feb8-43e4-8f8f-788ed5815c02.png)\r\n\r\nWhen `table.exec.source-idle-timeout` is set, the watermark is not aligned in the local phase and then pushes downstream.The UI is confusing,While the `idleness` effect is achieved, But the underlying logic doesn't seem to make sense.\r\n\r\nIn the `ALL-TO-ALL` case, as shown in down picture, each Input stream task contains all channels, and all Netty Input channels share a watermark value in main memory.Watermark Value or Watermark Status is updated in different input stream tasks. Other input stream tasks are clearly visible. (volatile)\r\n\r\n![OLWY%(4WEI 08W_}WK(YS4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10743150/180347084-67a0de1a-a0b2-4d86-ab43-5ff217b1f3c8.png)\r\n\r\nIn the case of `POINTWISE`, an input stream task contains only part of the Netty input channels, and each of its channels has its own independent watermark. So its watermark value, and the Posting and updating of the watermark status are only in its own part. That's what caused this. One or a portion of independent channels will advance the watermark to downstream without updating other channels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this situation, I made the following changes.\r\nHowever, because the streams task&channels are independent from each other, if the watermark in a certain channel is not aligned, it will not affect the watermark to advance the down stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter how many input streams and channels there are, or how they are connected, as long as  update the watermark value across the input stream with in the same Vertex.\r\n\r\nupdated effect\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10743150/180348902-9534980b-f643-4fa0-bf0f-a12a8925c15d.png)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *When creating a stream input task, collect all dataoutputs of the same vertex. When it is necessary to update the watermark, update all outputs together.*\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test case verifies that across multiple OneInputStreams update watermark.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T02:29:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-05T00:28:37Z","closed_at":"2022-08-05T00:28:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d2704dd7f2d6bfee292f2d096cdf778d6c19aab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5ecda5ec25b82ddf107c0496093e218796eabd1a","head":{"label":"nyingping:FLINK-28504","ref":"FLINK-28504","sha":"5ecda5ec25b82ddf107c0496093e218796eabd1a","user":{"login":"nyingping","id":10743150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10743150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping","html_url":"https://github.com/nyingping","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":516279836,"node_id":"R_kgDOHsXOHA","name":"flink","full_name":"nyingping/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nyingping","id":10743150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQzMTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10743150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping","html_url":"https://github.com/nyingping","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyingping/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nyingping/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, for sort blocking shuffle, the corresponding data readers read shuffle data in buffer granularity. Before compression, each buffer is 32K by default, after compression the size will become smaller (may less than 10K). For file IO, this is pretty smaller. \r\n\r\nTo achieve better performance and reduce IOPS, we can read more data per IO read request and parse buffer header and data in memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Read a full buffer of data per file IO read request for sort-shuffle*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionTest*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Implement getCatalogs in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Implement listCatalogs in the SqlGatewayService*\r\n  - *Implement GetCatalogs in the HiveServer2 Endpoint*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added list all catalogs in the `SqlGatewayServiceITCase`*\r\n  - *Use jdbc to fetch all catalogs in the `HiveServer2EndpointITCase`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, each FileReader(PartitionFileReader or HsSubpartitionFileReaderImpl) will internally allocate a headerbuffer with the size of 8B. Beside, PartitionFileReader also has a 12B indexEntryBuf. Because FileReader is of subpartition granularity, If the parallelism becomes very big, and there are many slots on each TM, the memory occupation will even reach the MB level. In fact, all FileReader of the same ResultPartition read data in a single thread, so we only need to allocate a headerbuffer to a ResultPartition to optimize this phenomenon.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Move `headerBuffer` and `indexEntryBuffer` from `PartitionedFileReader` to `SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler`*\r\n  - *Move `headerBuffer` from `HsSubpartitionFileReaderImpl` to `HsFileDataManager`.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-28121]Translate \"Extension Points\" and \"Full Stack Example\" in  \"User-defined Sources & Sinks\" page\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) no\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-21T10:49:50Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T11:22:17Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T11:21:55Z","merged_at":"2022-08-30T11:21:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3dcafa9db278fc02945c7bc5c32765c99d00bb1","assignee":{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3b8c906ff8bf7617e64d0ccf784b731dce7701ea","head":{"label":"chengkaiyang2025:FLINK-28121","ref":"FLINK-28121","sha":"3b8c906ff8bf7617e64d0ccf784b731dce7701ea","user":{"login":"chengkaiyang2025","id":8577744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1Nzc3NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8577744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025","html_url":"https://github.com/chengkaiyang2025","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481655468,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLV6rA","name":"flink-25705","full_name":"chengkaiyang2025/flink-25705","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chengkaiyang2025","id":8577744,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1Nzc3NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8577744?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025","html_url":"https://github.com/chengkaiyang2025","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chengkaiyang2025/gists{/gist_id}","starred

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nAdd substring_index(expr, delim, count) SQL function.\r\nExamples:\r\n```sql\r\n> SELECT substring_index('www.apache.org', '.', 2);\r\n www.apache \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add substringIndex method to SqlFunctionUtils.java\r\n- Add related expression, convert rule, and code gen.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as ScalarFunctionsTest#testSubstringIndex.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-21T10:12:03Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T02:04:44Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T02:04:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c05a946a177ec4a0bcb6a247001e31558de969cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d8d13c5926d23036dc26098210a36c189157c280","head":{"label":"zzzzzzzs:FLINK-26940","ref":"FLINK-26940","sha":"d8d13c5926d23036dc26098210a36c189157c280","user":{"login":"zzzzzzzs","id":25766626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25766626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":390586620,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTA1ODY2MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzzzzzzs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzzzzzzs","id":25766626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25766626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix invalid link in Python FAQ Document\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Replace invalid link with https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/downloads/setup-pyflink-virtual-env.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-21T09:52:41Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273024032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI0MDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=ProjectWebsite","name":"component=ProjectWebsite","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f851fdc78c7cc0e45a99419be31e10cdcdee181d","head":{"label":"bgeng777:FLINK-28503","ref":"FLINK-28503","sha":"f851fdc78c7cc0e45a99419be31e10cdcdee181d","user":{"login":"bgeng777","id":80749729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQ5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80749729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777","html_url":"https://github.com/bgeng777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":397297946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTcyOTc5NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"bgeng777/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bgeng777","id":80749729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQ5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80749729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777","html_url":"https://github.com/bgeng777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bgeng777/flink","description":"Apache
