for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes DSv2 refresh table semantics to also recache the target table itself.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently \"REFRESH TABLE\" in DSv2 only invalidate all caches referencing the table. With #30403 merged which adds support for caching a DSv2 table, we should also recache the target table itself to make the behavior consistent with DSv1. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now refreshing table in DSv2 also recache the target table itself.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded coverage of this new behavior in the existing UT for v2 refresh table command

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the maintenance interval is hard-coded in `StateStore`. This patch proposes to make it as SQL config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the maintenance interval is hard-coded in `StateStore`. For consistency reason, it should be placed together with other SS configs together. SQLConf also has a better way to have doc and default value setting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Previously users use Spark config to set the maintenance interval. Now they could use SQL config to set it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2020-12-11T22:15:38Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:11Z","closed_at":"2020-12-13T22:57:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4110509e23477cb82b5ac2aff6cebd9ae6fb63bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a simple change to support allocating a specified amount of overhead memory for the driver's mesos container.  This is already supported for executors.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is needed to keep the driver process from exceeding memory limits and being killed off when running on mesos.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds a `spark.mesos.driver.memoryOverhead` configuration option.  Documentation changes for this option are included in the PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases covering allocation of driver memory overhead are included in the changes.\r\n\r\n### Other notes\r\nThis is a second attempt to get this change reviewed, accepted and merged.  The original pull request was closed as stale back in January: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21006.\r\nFor this pull request, I took the original change by @pmackles, rebased it onto the current master branch, and added a test case that was requested in the original code review.\r\nI'm happy to make any further edits or do anything needed so that this can be included in a future spark release.  I keep having to build custom spark distributions so that we can use spark within our mesos clusters.","created_at":"2020-12-11T18:39:58Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T22:19:32Z","closed_at":"2020-12-15T22:00:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e4b8d7d971d8998418758aaf94f2fc8fb496446a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30739/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30739/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30739/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8149c343a533e0fdb5223725e14d54cfc2abc925","head":{"label":"dmcwhorter:dmcwhorter-SPARK-22256","ref":"dmcwhorter-SPARK-22256","sha":"8149c343a533e0fdb5223725e14d54cfc2abc925","user":{"login":"dmcwhorter","id":1111095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTEwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter","html_url":"https://github.com/dmcwhorter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":213749016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTM3NDkwMTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"dmcwhorter/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dmcwhorter","id":1111095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTEwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1111095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter","html_url":"https://github.com/dmcwhorter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmcwhorter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dmcwhorter/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30559 . The default parallelism config in Spark core is not good, as it's unclear where it applies. To not inherit this problem in Spark SQL, this PR refines the default parallelism SQL config, to make it clear that it only applies to leaf nodes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the config clearer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt changes an unreleased config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n\r\n- Respect `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` environment variables, or `spark.pyspark.python` and `spark.pyspark.driver.python` configurations in Kubernates just like other cluster types in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Depreate `spark.kubernetes.pyspark.pythonVersion` and guide users to set the environment variables and configurations for Python executables.\r\n    NOTE that `spark.kubernetes.pyspark.pythonVersion` is already a no-op configuration without this PR. Default is `3` and other values are disallowed.\r\n\r\n- In order for Python executable settings to be consistently used, fix `spark.archives` option to unpack into the current working directory in the driver of Kubernates' cluster mode. This behaviour is identical with Yarn's cluster mode. By doing this, users can leverage Conda or virtuenenv in cluster mode as below:\r\n\r\n   ```python\r\n    conda create -y -n pyspark_conda_env -c conda-forge pyarrow pandas conda-pack\r\n    conda activate pyspark_conda_env\r\n    conda pack -f -o pyspark_conda_env.tar.gz\r\n    PYSPARK_PYTHON=./environment/bin/python spark-submit --archives pyspark_conda_env.tar.gz#environment app.py\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n- Removed several unused or useless codes such as `extractS3Key` and `renameResourcesToLocalFS`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To provide a consistent support of PySpark by using `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` environment variables, or `spark.pyspark.python` and `spark.pyspark.driver.python` configurations.\r\n- To provide Conda and virtualenv support via `spark.archives` options.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes:\r\n\r\n- `spark.kubernetes.pyspark.pythonVersion` is deprecated.\r\n- `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` environment variables, and `spark.pyspark.python` and `spark.pyspark.driver.python` configurations are respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nminikube delete\r\nminikube start --cpus 12 --memory 16384\r\nkubectl create namespace spark-integration-test\r\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` from `createPartitions()` in Hive external catalog when a partition exists. Currently, `HiveExternalCatalog.createPartitions()` throws `AlreadyExistsException` wrapped by `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch `AlreadyExistsException` in `HiveClientImpl` and replace it by `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of Hive external catalog deviates from V1/V2 in-memory catalogs that throw `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`. To improve user experience with Spark SQL, it would be better to throw the same exception. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"hive/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.VersionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` from `createPartitions()` in Hive external catalog when a partition exists. Currently, `HiveExternalCatalog.createPartitions()` throws `AlreadyExistsException` wrapped by `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch `AlreadyExistsException` in `HiveClientImpl` and replace it by `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of Hive external catalog deviates from V1/V2 in-memory catalogs that throw `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`. To improve user experience with Spark SQL, it would be better to throw the same exception. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"hive/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.VersionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"hive/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveDDLSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Dongjoon Hyun

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` from `createPartitions()` in Hive external catalog when a partition exists. Currently, `HiveExternalCatalog.createPartitions()` throws `AlreadyExistsException` wrapped by `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch `AlreadyExistsException` in `HiveClientImpl` and replace it by `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of Hive external catalog deviates from V1/V2 in-memory catalogs that throw `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`. To improve user experience with Spark SQL, it would be better to throw the same exception. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"hive/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.VersionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify cache(`hadoopJobMetadata`) softValues to weakValues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce driver memory pressure, gc time and frequency, job execution time.\r\n\r\n`HadoopRDD` uses soft-reference map to cache `jobconf` (rdd_id -> jobconf)\r\nWhen the number of hive partitions read by the driver is large, HadoopRDD.getPartitions will create many jobconfs and add them to the cache.\r\nThe executor will also create a jobconf, add it to the cache, and share it among exeuctors.\r\n\r\nThe number of jobconfs in the driver cache increases the memory pressure. When the driver memory configuration is not high, full gc becoming very frequent, and these jobconfs are hardly reused.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExist UT\r\nManual

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR migrates `ALTER VIEW ... AS` to use `UnresolvedView` to resolve the view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nThe `TempViewOrV1Table` extractor in `ResolveSessionCatalog.scala` can now be removed as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo use `UnresolvedView` for view resolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe exception message changes if a table is found instead of view:\r\n```\r\n// OLD\r\n`tab1` is not a view\"\r\n```\r\n```\r\n// NEW\r\n\"tab1 is a table. 'ALTER VIEW ... AS' expects a view.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-12-11T05:25:49Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T08:39:39Z","closed_at":"2020-12-14T08:39:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab459d8951399c9a6a360f3916d53bf971039035","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22617568d69524852d46cf4db220610735e50cbd","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_view_as_statement","ref":"alter_view_as_statement","sha":"22617568d69524852d46cf4db220610735e50cbd","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn order to facilitate the troubleshooting of hotspots or data skew， it's better to add more information like address and cost time on  ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.\r\n\r\nThe new log are shown as below:\r\n\r\n> 2020-07-27 21:00:49,910 TRACE org.apache.spark.storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Got remote block shuffle_1_39_5 from **hostname:7337** cost  **3511 ms**\r\n\r\nWe can easily get the point that the current container cost **3511 ms** for getting remote block  from node **hostname:7337**.\r\n\r\nAnd the log would be printed  after 60s timeout.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdding more comprehensive logs helps locate problems quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-11T04:07:43Z","updated_at":"2021-04-07T00:18:04Z","closed_at":"2021-04-07T00:18:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe79ff1000f21a972a4520195909b75a074dc1c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/403c4259da80c08782b9560969804b3a0764d6d4","head":{"label":"southernriverchen:SPARK-33738","ref":"SPARK-33738","sha":"403c4259da80c08782b9560969804b3a0764d6d4","user":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145280540,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUyODA1NDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"southernriverchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen creating an external table, if the external path is not declared, an error will be reported, so the sense of interaction is not very user-friendly. \r\nWhen creating an internal table, a path is initialized, which is the default path. \r\nIf this path is also set to the path of the external table, user interaction will become more friendly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIncrease the friendly experience of user interaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe user does not

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n Avoid calling unregisterMapOutput when the map stage is being rerunning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen a fetch failure happened, DAGScheduler will try to unregister the corresponding map output. The current logic has a race condition that the new map stage attempt is running while the current reduce stage attempt returns another fetch failure (note: the current reduce stage firstly returns a fetch failure to make the maps stage is rerunning, and then the rerunning map stage may return some mapstatus of the failed MapId before the current reduce stage returns another fetch failure at the same MapId, the current reduce is last attempt due to the new map stage is not yet completed). In this case, if the map output is always unregistered, it may actually unregister the map output from the new map stage attempt.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. It is a

to probe for a custom Xattr if the size of\r\nthe generated file is 0 bytes; if found and parseable use that as\r\nthe declared length of the output.\r\n\r\nThe matching Hadoop patch in HADOOP-17414:\r\n\r\n* Returns all S3 object headers as XAttr attributes prefixed \"header.\"\r\n* Sets the custom header x-hadoop-s3a-magic-data-length to the length of\r\n  the data in the marker file.\r\n\r\nAs a result, spark job tracking will correctly report the amount of data uploaded\r\nand yet to materialize.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNow that S3 is consistent, it's a lot easier to use the S3A \"magic\" committer\r\nwhich redirects a file written to `dest/__magic/job_0011/task_1245/__base/year=2020/output.avro`\r\nto its final destination `dest/year=2020/output.avro` , adding a zero byte marker file at\r\nthe end and a json file `dest/__magic/job_0011/task_1245/__base/year=2020/output.avro.pending`\r\ncontaining all the information for the job committer to complete the upload.\r\n\r\nBut: the write tracker statictics don't show progress as they measure the length of the\r\ncreated file, find the marker file and report 0 bytes.\r\nBy probing for a specific HTTP header in the marker file and parsing that if\r\nretrieved, the real progress can be reported.\r\n\r\nThere's a matching change in Hadoop [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2530](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/2530)\r\nwhich adds getXAttr API support to the S3A connector and returns the headers; the magic\r\ncommitter adds the relevant attributes.\r\n\r\nIf the FS being probed doesn't support the XAttr API, the header is missing\r\nor the value not a positive long then the size of 0 is returned.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n \r\nNew tests in BasicWriteTaskStatsTrackerSuite which use a filter FS to\r\nimplement getXAttr on top of LocalFS; this is used to explore the set of\r\noptions:\r\n* no XAttr API implementation (existing tests; what callers would see with\r\n  most filesystems)\r\n* no attribute found (HDFS, ABFS without the attribute)\r\n* invalid data of different forms\r\n\r\nAll of these return Some(0) as file length.\r\n\r\nThe Hadoop PR verifies XAttr implementation in S3A and that\r\nthe commit protocol attaches the header to the files.\r\n\r\nExternal downstream testing has done the full hadoop+spark end\r\nto end operation, with manual review of logs to verify that the\r\ndata was successfully collected from the attribute.","created_at":"2020-12-10T20:32:22Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T01:51:53Z","closed_at":"2021-02-18T14:43:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c4fbdc1fdbfced2e770d3b4b100793d53ec6948","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/81c0a5244fa5a17184b59df9f08aed0d20868276","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cdpd/SPARK-33739-magic-commit-tracking-master","ref":"cdpd/SPARK-33739-magic-commit-tracking-master","sha":"81c0a5244fa5a17184b59df9f08aed0d20868276","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

sometimes is not easy to change the metrics.properties file to enable the metrics, for example when you are working with a scala app that is not running spark withing a cluster, but instead is using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `PartitionsAlreadyExistException` from `createPartitions()` in Hive external catalog when a partition exists. Currently, `HiveExternalCatalog.createPartitions()` throws `AlreadyExistsException` wrapped by `AnalysisException`.\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch `AlreadyExistsException` in `HiveClientImpl` and replace it by `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe behaviour of Hive external catalog deviates from V1/V2 in-memory catalogs that throw `PartitionsAlreadyExistException`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd min threshold time speculation config\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we turn on speculation with default configs we have the last 10% of the tasks subject to speculation. There are a lot of stages where the stage runs for few seconds to minutes. Also in general we don't want to speculate tasks that run within a minimum threshold. By setting a minimum threshold for speculation config gives us better control for speculative tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor the current version, partition pruning support is limited to the scene.\r\n\r\nLet's look at the implementation of the source code:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/031c5ef280e0cba8c4718a6457a44b6cccb17f46/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveShim.scala#L840\r\n\r\nHive getPartitionsByFilter() takes a string that represents partition predicates like \"str_key=\\\"value\\\" and int_key=1 ...\", but for normal functions like concat/concat_ws/substr,it  does not support.\r\n\r\nThis PR  supports  `concat/concat_ws`  to prune partitions, and  this framework is extensible，I'll add more  functions like `substring` and combinations of different functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe defect can cause a large number of partitions to be scanned which will increase the amount of data involved in the calculation and increase the pressure of service of metastore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-10T13:20:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-16T00:17:17Z","closed_at":"2021-04-16T00:17:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db69018c7afcdfb848b6f16b250d5de9b5c718b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92eff049ea3882e59c18dd0155d54fddde8c9baf","head":{"label":"southernriverchen:SPARK-33707","ref":"SPARK-33707","sha":"92eff049ea3882e59c18dd0155d54fddde8c9baf","user":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145280540,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUyODA1NDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"southernriverchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds connector interfaces proposed in the [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0NsQSryvNmXBY9kcvfINeYyKC-AahZarUqg3nS1GQs/edit#) for SPARK-23889.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This PR contains a subset of changes discussed in PR #29066.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nData sources should be able to request a specific distribution and ordering of data on write. In particular, these scenarios are considered useful:\r\n- global sort\r\n- cluster data and sort within partitions\r\n- local sort within partitions\r\n- no sort\r\n\r\nPlease see the design doc above for a more detailed explanation of requirements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces public changes to the DS V2 by adding a logical write abstraction as we have on the read path as well as additional interfaces to represent distribution and ordering of data (please see the doc for more info). \r\n\r\nThe existing `Distribution` interface in `read` package is read-specific and not flexible enough like discussed in the design doc. The current proposal is to evolve these interfaces separately until they converge.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds only

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-33546] stated the there are three inconsistency behaviors for CREATE TABLE LIKE.\r\n\r\n1. CREATE TABLE LIKE does not validate the user-specified hive serde. e.g., STORED AS PARQUET can't be used with ROW FORMAT SERDE.\r\n2. CREATE TABLE LIKE requires STORED AS and ROW FORMAT SERDE to be specified together, which is not necessary.\r\n3. CREATE TABLE LIKE does not respect the default hive serde.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix No.1, and after investigate, No.2 and No.3 turn out not to be issue.\r\n\r\nWithin Hive.\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE abc ... ROW FORMAT SERDE 'xxx.xxx.SerdeClass' (Without Stored as) will have\r\nfollowing result. Using the user specific SerdeClass and fetch default input/output format from default textfile format.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSerDe Library:          xxx.xxx.SerdeClass\r\nInputFormat:            org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat\r\nOutputFormat:           org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for\r\nCREATE TABLE dst LIKE src ROW FORMAT SERDE 'xxx.xxx.SerdeClass' (Without Stored as) will just ignore user specific SerdeClass and using (input, output, serdeClass) from src table.\r\n\r\nIt's better to just throw an exception on such ambiguous behavior, so No.2 is not an issue, but in the PR, we add some comments.\r\n\r\nFor No.3, in fact, CreateTableLikeCommand is using following logical to try to follow src table's storageFormat if current fileFormat.inputFormat is empty\r\n\r\n```\r\nval newStorage = if (fileFormat.inputFormat.isDefined) {\r\n      fileFormat\r\n    } else {\r\n      sourceTableDesc.storage.copy(locationUri = fileFormat.locationUri)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we try to fill the new target table with HiveSerDe.getDefaultStorage if file format and row format is not explicity spefified, it will break the CREATE TABLE LIKE semantic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBug Fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe deterministic field is wider than `NonDerterministic`, we should keep same range between pull out and check analysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```\r\nselect * from values(1), (4) as t(c1) order by java_method('java.lang.Math', 'abs', c1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will get exception since `java_method` deterministic field is false but not a `NonDeterministic`\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: nondeterministic expressions are only allowed in\r\nProject, Filter, Aggregate or Window, found:\r\n java_method('java.lang.Math', 'abs', t.`c1`) ASC NULLS FIRST\r\nin operator Sort [java_method(java.lang.Math, abs, c1#1) ASC NULLS FIRST], true\r\n               ;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis:\r\n1. switches Spark to use shaded Hadoop clients, namely hadoop-client-api and hadoop-client-runtime, for Hadoop 3.x. \r\n2. upgrade built-in version for Hadoop 3.x to Hadoop 3.2.2\r\n\r\nNote that for Hadoop 2.7, we'll still use the same modules such as hadoop-client.\r\n\r\nIn order to still keep default Hadoop profile to be hadoop-3.2, this defines the following Maven properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhadoop-client-api.artifact\r\nhadoop-client-runtime.artifact\r\nhadoop-client-minicluster.artifact\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich default to:\r\n```\r\nhadoop-client-api\r\nhadoop-client-runtime\r\nhadoop-client-minicluster\r\n```\r\nbut all switch to `hadoop-client` when the Hadoop profile is hadoop-2.7. A side affect from this is we'll import the same dependency multiple times. For this I have to disable Maven enforcer `banDuplicatePomDependencyVersions`.\r\n\r\nBesides above, there are the following changes:\r\n- explicitly add a few dependencies which are imported via transitive dependencies from Hadoop jars, but are removed from the shaded client jars.\r\n- removed the use of `ProxyUriUtils.getPath` from `ApplicationMaster` which is a server-side/private API.\r\n- modified `IsolatedClientLoader` to exclude `hadoop-auth` jars when Hadoop version is 3.x. This change should only matter when we're not sharing Hadoop classes with Spark (which is _mostly_ used in tests).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHadoop 3.2.2 is released with new features and bug fixes, so it's good for the Spark community to adopt it. However, latest Hadoop versions starting from Hadoop 3.2.1 have upgraded to use Guava 27+. In order to resolve Guava conflicts, this takes the approach by switching to shaded client jars provided by Hadoop. This also has the benefits of avoid pulling other 3rd party dependencies from Hadoop side so as to avoid more potential future conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen people use Spark with `hadoop-provided` option, they should make sure class path contains `hadoop-client-api` and `hadoop-client-runtime` jars. In addition, they may need to make sure these jars appear before other Hadoop jars in the order. Otherwise, classes may be loaded from the other non-shaded Hadoop jars and cause potential conflicts.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes `CatalogImpl.refreshTable` by using a new logical plan when recache the target table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `CatalogImpl.refreshTable`, we currently recache the target table via:\r\n```scala\r\nsparkSession.sharedState.cacheManager.cacheQuery(table, cacheName, cacheLevel)\r\n```\r\nHowever, here `table` is generated before the `tableRelationCache` in `SessionCatalog` is invalidated, and therefore it still refers to old and staled logical plan, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this fix behavior when a table is refreshed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHive and Spark SQL engines have many differences in built-in functions.The differences between several functions are shown below：\r\n\r\nbuild-in functions | SQL | result of Hive SQL | result of Spark SQL\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nunix_timestamp | select unix_timestamp(concat('2020-06-01',  ' 24:00:00')); | 1591027200 | NULL\r\nto_date | select to_date('0000-00-00'); | 0002-11-30 | NULL\r\ndatediff | select datediff(CURRENT_DATE, '0000-00-00'); | 737986 | NULL\r\ncollect_set | selectc1,c2,concat_ws('##', collect_set(c3)) c3_set from bigdata_offline.test_collect_set group by c1, c2; bigdata_offline.test_collect_set contains data:(1, 1, '1')，(1, 1, '2'),(1, 1, '3'),(1, 1, '4'),(1, 1, '5') | c1  c2  c3_set1   1   2##3##4##5##1 | c1  c2      c3_set1   1   3##1##2##5##4\r\n\r\nNotice: Hive version is 1.2.1\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere is no conclusion on which engine is more accurate. Users prefer to be able to make choices according to their real production environment.\r\n\r\nI think we should do some improvement for this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nmanual","created_at":"2020-12-09T12:57:51Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T03:26:51Z","closed_at":"2020-12-11T03:26:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"525e5a08e00fd86ea24e59c2f8597c7851465e1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/050101f1a775fd46d0f74a939e5b5aa949663c3a","head":{"label":"southernriverchen:SPARK-33721","ref":"SPARK-33721","sha":"050101f1a775fd46d0f74a939e5b5aa949663c3a","user":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145280540,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUyODA1NDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"southernriverchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen/spark","description":"Mirror

Move the `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` parsing tests to `AlterTableAddPartitionParserSuite`\r\n2. Place v1 tests for `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` from `DDLSuite` and v2 tests from `AlterTablePartitionV2SQLSuite` to the common trait `AlterTableAddPartitionSuiteBase`, so, the tests will run for V1, Hive V1 and V2 DS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The unification will allow to run common `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` tests for both DSv1 and Hive DSv1, DSv2\r\n- We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30488. This PR proposes to rename `Alias.deniedMetadataKeys` to `Alias.nonInheritableMetadataKeys` to make it less confusing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to maintain and read.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is rather a code cleanup.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan the unittests written in the previous PR manually. Jenkins and GitHub Actions in this PR should also test them.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-09T08:31:55Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:59:12Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T11:26:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb1ef330451291f06110bd557f607f75fca0a1bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40c580ebd49496336d732996f2e605ff8227e60e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33071-SPARK-33536","ref":"SPARK-33071-SPARK-33536","sha":"40c580ebd49496336d732996f2e605ff8227e60e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReplace `legacy_setops_precedence_enbled` with `legacy_setops_precedence_enabled`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, `legacy_setops_precedence_enabled` could be added, and `legacy_setops_precedence_enbled` retained, and if set the code could honor it and warn about the deprecated spelling.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`enabled` is misspelled in `legacy_setops_precedence_enbled`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nIt would break current consumers.\r\nExamples include:\r\n*

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds `allowTemp` flag to `UnresolvedView` so that `Analyzer` can check whether to resolve temp views or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR also migrates `ALTER VIEW ... SET/UNSET TBLPROPERTIES` to use `UnresolvedView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo use `UnresolvedView` for view resolution.\r\n\r\nOne benefit is that the exception message is better for `ALTER VIEW ... SET/UNSET TBLPROPERTIES`. Before, if a temp view is passed, you will just get `NoSuchTableException` with `Table or view 'tmpView' not found in database 'default'`. But with this PR, you will get more description exception message: `tmpView is a temp view. ALTER VIEW ... SET TBLPROPERTIES expects a permanent view`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe exception message changes as describe above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-12-08T19:13:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T08:01:08Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T05:19:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84a87558eea29f865092deb75b28a604b8b64308","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3425b994b9c0c13de63c98e3a53191904d992425","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_view_set_unset_properties","ref":"alter_view_set_unset_properties","sha":"3425b994b9c0c13de63c98e3a53191904d992425","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMissing POD detection is extended by timestamp (and time limit) based check to avoid wrongfully detection of missing POD detection.\r\n\r\nThe two new timestamps:\r\n- `fullSnapshotTs` is introduced for the `ExecutorPodsSnapshot` which only updated by the pod polling snapshot source\r\n- `registrationTs` is introduced for the `ExecutorData` and it is initialized at the executor registration at the scheduler backend\r\n \r\nMoreover a new config `spark.kubernetes.executor.missingPodDetectDelta` is used to specify the accepted delta between the two.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWatching a POD (`ExecutorPodsWatchSnapshotSource`) only inform about single POD changes. This could wrongfully lead to detecting of missing PODs (PODs known by scheduler backend but missing from POD snapshots) by the executor POD lifecycle manager. \r\n\r\nA key indicator of this error is seeing this log message:\r\n\r\n> \"The executor with ID [some_id] was not found in the cluster but we didn't get a reason why. Marking the executor as failed. The executor may have been deleted but the driver missed the deletion event.\"\r\n\r\nSo one of the problem is running the missing POD detection check even when a single POD is changed without having a full consistent snapshot about all the PODs (see `ExecutorPodsPollingSnapshotSource`). \r\nThe other problem could be the race between the executor POD lifecycle manager and the scheduler backend: so even in case of a having a full snapshot the registration at the scheduler backend could precede the snapshot polling (and processing of those polled snapshots).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. When the POD is missing then the reason message explaining the executor's exit is extended with both timestamps (the polling time and the executor registration time) and even the new config is mentioned.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing unit tests are extended.","created_at":"2020-12-08T19:10:37Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T22:29:11Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T22:25:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4157c43c0c37512285ff02326771cd5701d9a12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a98bf364b8ccdfdc5abef4b4355e61c74c9f3802","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-33711","ref":"SPARK-33711","sha":"a98bf364b8ccdfdc5abef4b4355e61c74c9f3802","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Spark treats 0.0 and -0.0 semantically equal, while it still retains the difference between them so that users can see -0.0 when displaying the data set.\r\n\r\nThe comparison expressions in Spark take care of the special floating numbers and implement the correct semantic. However, Spark doesn't always use these comparison expressions to compare values, and we need to normalize the special floating numbers before comparing them in these places:\r\n1. GROUP BY\r\n2. join keys\r\n3. window partition keys\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes one more place that compares values without using comparison expressions: HyperLogLog++\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the query result\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the result of HyperLogLog++ becomes correct now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Kafka offset reader which uses `AdminClient` still uses `UninterruptibleThread` to call it. Since there is no evidence that `AdminClient` suffers from similar issues like [KAFKA-1894](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1894) I'm removing `UninterruptibleThread` usage. In order to put the `AdminClient` under stress and make sure it works I've created the following standalone application: https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/kafka-admin-interruption\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Removed `UninterruptibleThread` from `KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin`\r\n* Removed/modified comments which are not true\r\n* Adapted `KafkaRelationSuite`\r\n* Renamed `partitionsAssignedToConsumer` to `partitionsAssignedToAdmin`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin` doesn't need `UninterruptibleThread` usage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests + manually with simple Kafka to Kafka

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Check that the partition identifier passed to `SupportsPartitionManagement.partitionExists()` is fully specified (specifies all values of partition fields).\r\n2. Remove the custom implementation of `partitionExists()` from `InMemoryPartitionTable`, and re-use the default implementation from `SupportsPartitionManagement`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe method is supposed to check existence of one partition but currently it can return `true` for partially specified partition. This can lead to incorrect commands behavior, for instance the commands could modify or place data in the middle of partition path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AlterTablePartitionV2SQLSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *SupportsPartitionManagementSuite\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T08:17:23Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:04:09Z","closed_at":"2020-12-11T12:48:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16cfbaa2eeae217215dac4cdf7d2fc73ae0fd308","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c5cd182f7a008cc8363db846e60410e8aead4e3","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:check-len-partitionExists","ref":"check-len-partitionExists","sha":"4c5cd182f7a008cc8363db846e60410e8aead4e3","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor HiveGenericUDTF , there are two initialization methods:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public StructObjectInspector initialize(StructObjectInspector argOIs)\r\n      throws UDFArgumentException {\r\n    List<? extends StructField> inputFields = argOIs.getAllStructFieldRefs();\r\n    ObjectInspector[] udtfInputOIs = new ObjectInspector[inputFields.size()];\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < inputFields.size(); i++) {\r\n      udtfInputOIs[i] = inputFields.get(i).getFieldObjectInspector();\r\n    }\r\n    return initialize(udtfInputOIs);\r\n  }\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  public StructObjectInspector initialize(ObjectInspector[] argOIs)\r\n      throws UDFArgumentException {\r\n    throw new IllegalStateException(\"Should not be called directly\");\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAs https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-5737 mentioned, hive provided StructObjectInspector for UDTFs rather than ObjectInspect[], but Spark SQL  still only support deprecated function.\r\n\r\nAn exception will be reported before fix:\r\n\r\n> Error in query: No handler for UDF/UDAF/UDTF 'FeatureParseUDTF1': java.lang.IllegalStateException: Should not be called directly\r\n> Please make sure your function overrides public StructObjectInspector initialize(ObjectInspector[] args).; line 1 pos 7\r\n\r\nThis pr will resolve the exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n For the migration of  Hive to Spark SQL，we face many UDTF functions throw exception because this issue，It’s really a great improvement for attracting users to Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T07:18:33Z","updated_at":"2021-01-01T04:06:04Z","closed_at":"2021-01-01T04:06:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"001b2cce04a3ad931bf1aabf975b29c6cd554f45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e3dca1ea3228747a43d573075bc6162cc76d475","head":{"label":"southernriverchen:SPARK-33704","ref":"SPARK-33704","sha":"0e3dca1ea3228747a43d573075bc6162cc76d475","user":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145280540,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDUyODA1NDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"southernriverchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"southernriverchen","id":48309548,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ4MzA5NTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48309548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen","html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/southernriverchen/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/southernriverchen/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` to use `UnresolvedTable` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nNote that `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` is not supported for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR makes the resolution consistent behavior consistent. For example,\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE test\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.test.t (id bigint, val string) USING csv PARTITIONED BY (id)\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE spark_catalog.test\")\r\nsql(\"MSCK REPAIR TABLE t\") // works fine\r\n```\r\n, but after this PR:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"MSCK REPAIR TABLE t\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: t is a temp view. 'MSCK REPAIR TABLE' expects a table; line 1 pos 0\r\n```\r\n, which is the consistent behavior with other commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `MSCK REPAIR TABLE t` in the above example is resolved to a temp view `t` first instead of `spark_catalog.test.t`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T06:32:10Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T05:06:51Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T05:06:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e29b0c36d92173294a1736ba949a92bb089e0522","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6b776e37bdb5d0b03960cddeb5e2f0c3f460cfb","head":{"label":"imback82:repair_table_V2","ref":"repair_table_V2","sha":"f6b776e37bdb5d0b03960cddeb5e2f0c3f460cfb","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes the rule `RemoveRedundantProjects` from by default passing column ordering requirements from parent nodes to always require column orders regardless of the requirements from parent nodes unless otherwise specified. More specifically, instead of excluding a few nodes like GenerateExec, UnionExec that are known to require children columns to be ordered, the rule now includes a whitelist of nodes that allow passing through the ordering requirements from their parents.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, this rule passes through ordering requirements from parents directly to children except for a few excluded nodes. This incorrectly removes the necessary project nodes below a UnionExec since it is not excluded. An earlier PR also fixed a similar issue for GenerateExec (SPARK-32861). In order to prevent similar issues, the rule should be changed to always require column ordering except for a few specific nodes that we know for sure can pass through the requirements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in SPARK-33673, some test suites in `ParquetV2SchemaPruningSuite` will failed when set `parquet.version` to 1.11.1 because Parquet will return empty results for non-existent column since PARQUET-1765.\r\n\r\nThis pr change to use `readDataSchema()` instead of `schema` to build `pushedParquetFilters` in `ParquetScanBuilder` to avoid push down partition filters to `ParquetScan` for `DataSourceV2`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrepare for upgrade using Parquet 1.11.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30554 . Now we have a new config for converting CREATE TABLE, we don't need the old config that only works for CTAS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's confusing for having two config while one can cover another completely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, it's deprecating not removing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nN/A","created_at":"2020-12-07T15:59:07Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T19:35:08Z","closed_at":"2020-12-07T18:50:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"066682fe8763a9ac5d399db281a7215d6cb528e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f11cd72a21a4b6d20e0ea5b6bb943784e0ed434","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:minor","ref":"minor","sha":"0f11cd72a21a4b6d20e0ea5b6bb943784e0ed434","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to support the (non-legacy) delay scheduling for the barrier execution. \r\n\r\nThe idea is, adding a pending launch tasks list(`barrierPendingLaunchTasks`) in the barrier `TaskSetManager`. And we don't really add those pending launch tasks to the running list and post task start event to the listeners and so on until all tasks in the barrier `TaskSetManager` has been added to `barrierPendingLaunchTasks` after a single round `resourceOffers()`. If there're only partial tasks that are able to launch after a single `rousourceOffers()` round, we'll revert all the assigned resources to those tasks which were added in `barrierPendingLaunchTasks` and clear `barrierPendingLaunchTasks` and wait for the next `resourceOffers()` round. The barrier `TaskSetManager` should be launched finally since we've ensured enough slots before the scheduling.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, with delay scheduling enabled for the barrier execution, the application can abort immediately when there're only partial tasks can be launched. This is really bad, especially when the application already completed many stages before the barrier stage. For example, the application may do some ETL jobs before the barrier job(for ML).\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, this scenario  should no longer happen.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users will no longer face the `Fail resource offers for barrier stage...` error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded/updated unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-07T15:07:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-20T03:09:58Z","closed_at":"2021-02-19T22:05:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba9cffe746f8b12c125a94e18b00f63159a10454","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30650/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30650/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30650/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fead0790b2ed5bc27abf6f46de3ae8e84f3ac640","head":{"label":"Ngone51:barrier-delay-scheduling","ref":"barrier-delay-scheduling","sha":"fead0790b2ed5bc27abf6f46de3ae8e84f3ac640","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Remove old statement `ShowTableStatement`\r\n2. Introduce new command `ShowTableExtended` for  `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step of new V2 implementation of `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED`, see SPARK-33393.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: SPARK-29900.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe changes should not affect V1 tables. For V2, Spark outputs the error:\r\n```\r\nSHOW TABLE EXTENDED is not supported for v2 tables.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *ShowTablesSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2020-12-07T12:22:20Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:04:06Z","closed_at":"2020-12-08T12:09:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb1259f49f411110183646fdbe0e1f81fc9ce51d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d3c06e83442d10c016e2d7fc8c1758756cad46b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:show-table-extended-statement","ref":"show-table-extended-statement","sha":"4d3c06e83442d10c016e2d7fc8c1758756cad46b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror
