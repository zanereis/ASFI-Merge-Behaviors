What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdding convenience function to Python `JavaWrapper` so that it is easy to create a Py4J JavaArray that is compatible with current class constructors that have a Scala `Array` as input so that it is not necessary to have a Java/Python friendly constructor.  The function takes a Java class as input that is used by Py4J to create the Java array of the given class.  As an example, `OneVsRest` has been updated to use this and the alternate constructor is removed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the new convenience function and updated `OneVsRest` doctests which use this to persist the

What changes were proposed in this pull request\n\nThis PR allows user to define an AggregateFunction which can store **arbitrary** Java objects\nin aggregation buffer, and use the Java object to do aggregation. Before this PR, user are only allowed to store a limited set of object type in aggregation buffer. Please see example usage at\nclass `org.apache.spark.sql.AggregateWithObjectAggregateBufferSuite.MaxWithObjectAggregateBuffer`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSome JDBC driver (for example PostgreSQL) does not use the underlying exception as cause, but have another APIs (getNextException) to access that, so it it's not included in the error logging, making us hard to find the root cause, especially in batch mode.\n\nThis PR will pull out the next exception and add it as cause (if it's different) or suppressed (if there is another different cause).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCan't reproduce this on the default JDBC driver, so did not add a regression test.\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T20:26:35Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T17:31:37Z","closed_at":"2016-08-23T16:47:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"363da23e7bca43df9b371a82ce9c78ef979438eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51fbf25a2ba5dc8c293f153b772e55050772c1f1","head":{"label":"davies:keep_cause","ref":"keep_cause","sha":"51fbf25a2ba5dc8c293f153b772e55050772c1f1","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we join two DataFrames which are originated from a same DataFrame, operations to the joined DataFrame can fail.\n\nOne reproducible  example is as follows.\n\n```\nval df = Seq(\n  (1, \"a\", \"A\"),\n  (2, \"b\", \"B\"),\n  (3, \"c\", \"C\"),\n  (4, \"d\", \"D\"),\n  (5, \"e\", \"E\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\", \"col3\")\n  val filtered = df.filter(\"col1 != 3\").select(\"col1\", \"col2\")\n  val joined = filtered.join(df, filtered(\"col1\") === df(\"col1\"), \"inner\")\n  val selected1 = joined.select(df(\"col3\"))\n```\n\nIn this case, AnalysisException is thrown.\n\nAnother example is as follows.\n\n```\nval df = Seq(\n  (1, \"a\", \"A\"),\n  (2, \"b\", \"B\"),\n  (3, \"c\", \"C\"),\n  (4, \"d\", \"D\"),\n  (5, \"e\", \"E\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\", \"col3\")\n  val filtered = df.filter(\"col1 != 3\").select(\"col1\", \"col2\")\n  val rightOuterJoined = filtered.join(df, filtered(\"col1\") === df(\"col1\"), \"right\")\n  val selected2 = rightOuterJoined.select(df(\"col1\"))\n  selected2.show\n```\n\nIn this case, we will expect to get the answer like as follows.\n\n```\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\nBut the actual result is as follows.\n\n```\n1\n2\nnull\n4\n5\n```\n\nThe cause of the problems in the examples is that the logical plan related to the right side DataFrame and the expressions of its output are re-created in the analyzer (at ResolveReference rule) when a DataFrame has expressions which have a same exprId each other.\nRe-created expressions are equally to the original ones except exprId.\nThis will happen when we do self-join or similar pattern operations.\n\nIn the first example, `df(\"col3\")` returns a Column which includes an expression and the expression have an exprId (say id1 here).\nAfter join, the expresion which the right side DataFrame (`df`) has is re-created and the old and new expressions are equally but exprId is renewed (say id2 for the new exprId here).\nBecause of the mismatch of those exprIds, AnalysisException is thrown.\n\nIn the second example, `df(\"col1\")` returns a column and the expression contained in the column is assigned an exprId (say id3).\nOn the other hand, a column returned by `filtered(\"col1\")` has an expression which has the same exprId (id3).\nAfter join, the expressions in the right side DataFrame are re-created and the expression assigned id3 is no longer present in the right side but present in the left side.\nSo, referring `df(\"col1\")` to the joined DataFrame, we get col1 of right side which includes null.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I have introduced `LazilyDeterminedAttribute`.\nIt is returned when we refer a column like `df(\"expr\")` and determines which expression `df(\"expr\")` should point to lazily.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added some test

Spark Yarn Shuffle Service doesn't re-initialize the application credentials early enough which causes any other spark executors trying to fetch from that node during a rolling upgrade to fail with \"java.lang.NullPointerException: Password cannot be null if SASL is enabled\".  Right now the spark shuffle service relies on the Yarn nodemanager to re-register the applications, unfortunately this is after we open the port for other executors to connect. If other executors connected before the re-register they get a null pointer exception which isn't a re-tryable exception and cause them to fail pretty quickly. To solve this I added another leveldb file so that it can save and re-initialize all the applications before opening the port for other executors to connect to it.  Adding another leveldb was simpler from the code structure point of view.\n\nMost of the code changes are moving things to common util class.\n\nPatch was tested manually on a Yarn cluster with rolling upgrade was happing while spark job was running. Without the patch I consistently get the NullPointerException, with the patch the job gets a few Connection refused exceptions but the retries kick in and the it succeeds.\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T14:23:57Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T17:57:48Z","closed_at":"2016-09-02T17:44:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"308e8e3d84be0c842e0a7061a4e16479c3c706d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14718/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14718/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14718/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/531998100509601f15c236830d4edc9278e2e8d8","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-16711","ref":"SPARK-16711","sha":"531998100509601f15c236830d4edc9278e2e8d8","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLinear/logistic regression use treeAggregate with default depth (always = 2) for collecting coefficient gradient updates to the driver. For high dimensional problems, this can cause OOM error on the driver. This patch makes it configurable to avoid this problem if users' input data has many features. It adds a HasTreeDepth API in `sharedParams.scala`, and extends it to both Linear regression and logistic regression in .ml\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T13:26:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-21T03:24:58Z","closed_at":"2016-08-21T01:54:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"925110aafd6d38fa3978919c08737b0c859dc69b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd68247022e34eae8b035979402db680284a4e72","head":{"label":"hqzizania:SPARK-17090","ref":"SPARK-17090","sha":"bd68247022e34eae8b035979402db680284a4e72","user":{"login":"hqzizania","id":9315372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMTUzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9315372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania","html_url":"https://github.com/hqzizania","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28621014,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODYyMTAxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hqzizania/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hqzizania","id":9315372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMTUzNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9315372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania","html_url":"https://github.com/hqzizania","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqzizania/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hqzizania/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the existing code, `MinMaxScaler` handle `NaN` value indeterminately. \n- If a column has identity value, that is `max == min`, `MinMaxScalerModel` transformation will output `0.5` for all rows even the original value is `NaN`.\n- Otherwise, it will remain `NaN` after transformation.\n\nI think we should unify the behavior by remaining `NaN` value at any condition, since we don't know how to transform a `NaN` value. In Python sklearn, it will throw exception when there is `NaN` in the dataset.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T08:52:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T10:27:08Z","closed_at":"2016-08-19T10:25:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9105433d36921e3e934fc40d00149a048e7946e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/19cb3ad4f9ffcba351607be6e0129b941115823b","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-17141","ref":"spark-17141","sha":"19cb3ad4f9ffcba351607be6e0129b941115823b","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch changes predicate pushdown optimization rule (PushDownPredicate) from using a blacklist to a whitelist. That is to say, operators must be explicitly allowed. This approach is more future-proof: previously it was possible for us to introduce a new operator and then render the optimization rule incorrect.\n\nThis also fixes the bug that previously we allowed pushing filter beneath limit, which was incorrect. That is to say, before this patch, the optimizer would rewrite\n\n```\nselect * from (select * from range(10) limit 5) where id > 3\n\nto\n\nselect * from range(10) where id > 3 limit 5\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n- a unit test case in FilterPushdownSuite\n- an end-to-end test in limit.sql\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T07:01:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T13:13:40Z","closed_at":"2016-08-19T13:13:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cffb5bf765993729adbf9c7b891e529de17d2674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14713/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14713/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14713/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82935a7d57011127c04522e753befdc53bcefa27","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-16994","ref":"SPARK-16994","sha":"82935a7d57011127c04522e753befdc53bcefa27","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Support generation table-level statistics for \n   - hive tables in `HiveExternalCatalog`\n   - data source tables in `HiveExternalCatalog`\n   - data source tables in `InMemoryCatalog`.\n2. Add a property \"stats\" in `CatalogTable` to hold statistics in Spark side.\n3. Put logics of statistics transformation between Spark and Hive in `HiveExternalCatalog`.\n4. Extend Statistics class by adding `rowCount` (will add estimatedSize when we have column stats).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request reverts the changes made as a part of #14605, which simply side-steps the deadlock issue. Instead, I propose the following approach:\n- Use `scheduleWithFixedDelay` when calling `ExecutorAllocationManager.schedule` for scheduling executor requests. The intent of this is that if invocations are delayed beyond the default schedule interval on account of lock contention, then we avoid a situation where calls to `schedule` are made back-to-back, potentially releasing and then immediately reacquiring these locks - further exacerbating contention.\n- Replace a number of calls to `askWithRetry` with `ask` inside of message handling code in `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` and its ilk. This allows us queue messages with the relevant endpoints, release whatever locks we might be holding, and then block whilst awaiting the response. This change is made at the cost of being able to retry should sending the message fail, as retrying outside of the lock could easily cause race conditions if other conflicting messages have been sent whilst awaiting a response. I believe this to be the lesser of two evils, as in many cases these RPC calls are to process local components, and so failures are more likely to be deterministic, and timeouts are more likely to be caused by lock contention.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests, and manual tests under yarn-client mode.\n","created_at":"2016-08-19T04:43:44Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T03:37:47Z","closed_at":"2016-09-01T17:37:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8bd7af73d40e901e64f8d15d7247877f110041a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14710/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14710/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0772e8195443566d37c9837798ef075eaa79c66b","head":{"label":"angolon:SPARK-16533","ref":"SPARK-16533","sha":"0772e8195443566d37c9837798ef075eaa79c66b","user":{"login":"angolon","id":1421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon","html_url":"https://github.com/angolon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64194423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDE5NDQyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"angolon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"angolon","id":1421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon","html_url":"https://github.com/angolon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angolon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/angolon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded `ScriptTransformationExec` which would run script operator in SQL mode (w/o Hive). Since this has to run w/o Hive, it does not support Hive serdes. `ScriptTransformBase` has common code across `ScriptTransformationExec` and `HiveScriptTransformationExec`. \n\nChanges done:\n- Renamed `ScriptTransformation` to `HiveScriptTransformationExec`\n- Added `ScriptTransformationExec` which would run script operator in SQL mode (w/o Hive). \n  - The output of script would be read as a string and column values are extracted by using a delimiter (default : tab character)\n- `ScriptTransformBase` has common code used across `ScriptTransformationExec` and `HiveScriptTransformationExec`\n- For thread writing data to script, `ScriptTransformationWriterThread` has the core logic. `HiveScriptTransformationWriterThread` extends that for Hive specific stuff.\n  - `ScriptTransformationWriterThread` will be used for Spark SQL. It only supports writing data to script process by serializing column values as tab delimited string\n  - `HiveScriptTransformationWriterThread` additionally supports Hive serde\n- Added a `Strategy` named `Scripts` which would emit `ScriptTransformationExec` in physical plans. This would be used in non-Hive mode.\n\nFuture TODOs:\n- Support some notion of `Serde` in `ScriptTransformationExec`\n- For Hive, by default only serde's must be used\n- Cleanup past hacks that are observed (and people suggest / report)\n  - Move LogicalPlanToSQLSuite out of hive module and put inside sql\n- Use code-gen projection to serialize rows to output stream (suggestion by @hvanhovell )\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added `ScriptTransformationExecSuite`\n- `HiveScriptTransformationexecSuite` to use `HiveScriptTransformationExec`\n","created_at":"2016-08-18T17:03:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-22T21:27:46Z","closed_at":"2017-05-11T14:08:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92f8872475f8f5503e9857e794939ab10e74ed3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9047f0d5728075d8b50c64afbef65a5279a1847","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-15694_Transform","ref":"SPARK-15694_Transform","sha":"d9047f0d5728075d8b50c64afbef65a5279a1847","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently `MapObjects` does not make copies of unsafe-backed data, leading to problems like [SPARK-17061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17061) [SPARK-17093](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17093).\n\nThis patch makes `MapObjects` make copies of unsafe-backed data.\n\nGenerated code - prior to this patch:\n\n``` java\n...\n/* 295 */ if (isNull12) {\n/* 296 */   convertedArray1[loopIndex1] = null;\n/* 297 */ } else {\n/* 298 */   convertedArray1[loopIndex1]

convertedArray1[loopIndex1] = value12 instanceof UnsafeRow? value12.copy() : value12;\n/* 299 */ }\n...\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd a new test case which would fail without this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a longstanding issue with one of the RelationalGroupedDataset.agg function. Even though the signature accepts vararg of pairs, the underlying implementation turns the seq into a map, and thus not order preserving nor allowing multiple aggregates per column.\n\nThis change also allows users to use this function to run multiple different aggregations for a single column, e.g.\n\n```\nagg(\"age\" -> \"max\", \"age\" -> \"count\")\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case in DataFrameAggregateSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-08-18T06:51:20Z","updated_at":"2016-08-20T16:28:22Z","closed_at":"2016-08-20T16:28:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c2b662f776ec40a5393c0287089d7ae53e78d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f8930e33c60663c74ea46e1be31cc542bc4ed60","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-17124","ref":"SPARK-17124","sha":"5f8930e33c60663c74ea46e1be31cc542bc4ed60","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n_HOST is a placeholder for the host which is used widely for hadoop components (like NN/DN/RM/NM and etc), this is useful for automatic configuration of some cluster deployment tool. It is would be nice that spark can also support this, especially useful for spark thrift server.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually in a secured

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes executor OOM in offheap mode due to bug in Cooperative Memory Management for UnsafeExternSorter.  UnsafeExternalSorter was checking if memory page is being used by upstream by comparing the base object address of the current page with the base object address of upstream. However, in case of offheap memory allocation, the base object addresses are always null, so there was no spilling happening and eventually the operator would OOM.  \n\nFollowing is the stack trace this issue addresses -\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Unable to acquire 1220 bytes of memory, got 0\n    at org.apache.spark.memory.MemoryConsumer.allocatePage(MemoryConsumer.java:120)\n    at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn 2.0, we change the threshold of splitting expressions from 16K to 64K, which cause very bad performance on wide table, because the generated method can't be JIT compiled by default (above the limit of 8K bytecode). \n\nThis PR will decrease it to 1K, based on the benchmark results for a wide table with 400 columns of LongType.\n\nIt also fix a bug around splitting expression in whole-stage codegen (it should not split them).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded benchmark suite.\n","created_at":"2016-08-17T22:06:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T08:18:43Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T08:18:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a5ed5f792cd88160e7cbaa158891c2112114318","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad1d83f52525679a9f987bd5fd0c79dea04692a0","head":{"label":"davies:split_exprs","ref":"split_exprs","sha":"ad1d83f52525679a9f987bd5fd0c79dea04692a0","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

PR addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16980.)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn a new Spark session, when a partitioned Hive table is converted to use Spark's `HadoopFsRelation` in `HiveMetastoreCatalog`, metadata for every partition of that table are retrieved from the metastore and loaded into driver memory. In addition, every partition's metadata files are read from the filesystem to perform schema inference.\n\nIf a user queries such a table with predicates which prune that table's partitions, we would like to be able to answer that query without consulting partition metadata which are not involved in the query. When querying a table with a large number of partitions for some data from a small number of partitions (maybe even a single partition), the current conversion strategy is highly inefficient. I suspect this scenario is not uncommon in the wild.\n\nIn addition to being inefficient in running time, the current strategy is inefficient in its use of driver memory. When the sum of the number of partitions of all tables loaded in a driver reaches a certain level (somewhere in the tens of thousands), their cached data exhaust all driver heap memory in the default configuration. I suspect this scenario is less common (in that not too many deployments work with tables with tens of thousands of partitions), however this does illustrate how large the memory footprint of this metadata can be. With tables with hundreds or thousands of partitions, I would expect the `HiveMetastoreCatalog` table cache to represent a significant portion of the driver's heap space.\n\nThis PR proposes an alternative approach. Basically, it makes four changes:\n1. It adds a new method, `listPartitionsByFilter` to the Catalyst `ExternalCatalog` trait which returns the partition metadata for a given sequence of partition pruning predicates.\n2. It refactors the `FileCatalog` type hierarchy to include a new `TableFileCatalog` to efficiently return files only for partitions matching a sequence of partition pruning predicates.\n3. It removes partition loading and caching from `HiveMetastoreCatalog`.\n4. It adds a new Catalyst optimizer rule, `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, which applies a plan's partition-pruning predicates to prune out unnecessary partition files from a `HadoopFsRelation`'s underlying file catalog.\n\nThe net effect is that when a query over a partitioned Hive table is planned, the analyzer retrieves the table metadata from `HiveMetastoreCatalog`. As part of this operation, the `HiveMetastoreCatalog` builds a `HadoopFsRelation` with a `TableFileCatalog`. It does not load any partition metadata or scan any files. The optimizer prunes-away unnecessary table partitions by sending the partition-pruning predicates to the relation's `TableFileCatalog`. The `TableFileCatalog` in turn calls the `listPartitionsByFilter` method on its external catalog. This queries the Hive metastore, passing along those filters.\n\nAs a bonus, performing partition pruning during optimization leads to a more accurate relation size estimate. This, along with c481bdf, can lead to automatic, safe application of the broadcast optimization in a join where it might previously have been omitted.\n## Open Issues\n1. This PR omits partition metadata caching. I can add this once the overall strategy for the cold path is established, perhaps in a future PR.\n2. This PR removes and omits partitioned Hive table schema reconciliation. As a result, it fails to find Parquet schema columns with upper case letters because of the Hive metastore's case-insensitivity. This issue may be fixed by #14750, but that PR appears to have stalled. @ericl has contributed to this PR a workaround for Parquet wherein schema reconciliation occurs at query execution time instead of planning. Whether ORC requires a similar patch is an open issue.\n3. This PR omits an implementation of `listPartitionsByFilter` for the `InMemoryCatalog`.\n4. This PR breaks parquet log output redirection during query execution. I can work around this by running `Class.forName(\"org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$\")` first thing in a Spark shell session, but I haven't figured out how to fix this properly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe current Spark unit tests were run, and some ad-hoc tests were performed to validate that only the necessary partition metadata is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently `LogicalRelation.newInstance()` simply creates another `LogicalRelation` object with the same parameters. However, the `newInstance()` method inherited from `MultiInstanceRelation` should return a copy of object with unique expression ids. Current `LogicalRelation.newInstance()` can cause failure when doing self-join.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe use reflection to convert `TreeNode` to json string, and currently don't support arbitrary object. `UserDefinedGenerator` takes a function object, so we should skip json format test for it, or the tests can be flacky, e.g. `DataFrameSuite.simple explode`, this test always fail with scala 2.10(branch 1.6 builds with scala 2.10 by default), but pass with scala 2.11(master branch builds with scala 2.11 by default).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-08-17T06:42:50Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T12:33:39Z","closed_at":"2016-08-17T16:33:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a982b0a40d959c95aba1a188f447f91efc6aa7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14679/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14679/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14679/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c04084d29c3d049053a5929d6860006549c96573","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:json","ref":"json","sha":"c04084d29c3d049053a5929d6860006549c96573","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI first thought they are missing because they are kind of hidden options but it seems they are just missing.\n\nFor example, `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema` is documented in [sql-programming-guide.md](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/sql-programming-guide.md) but this function is missing whereas many options such as `spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin` are not documented but have its own function individually.\n\nSo, this PR suggests making them consistent by adding the missing functions for some options in `SQLConf` and use them where applicable, in order to make them more readable. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-08-17T05:14:48Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:39:41Z","closed_at":"2016-09-14T17:36:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8d2e89b5c4e3d564ae20915d05003b8336f06c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a26c08e402daf7c972e7267b25230defcf2ebdb9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:sqlconf-cleanup","ref":"sqlconf-cleanup","sha":"a26c08e402daf7c972e7267b25230defcf2ebdb9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis should be credited to @mvervuurt. The main purpose of this PR is\n- simply to include the change for the same instance in `DataFrameReader` just to match up.\n- just avoid duplicately verifying the PR (as I already did).\n\nThe documentation for both should be the same because both assume the `properties` should be  the same `dict` for the same option.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually building Python documentation.\n\nThis will produce the output as below:\n- `DataFrameReader`\n\n![2016-08-17 11 12

The `Array[StackTraceElements]` returned by `SparkException.stackTrace()` is mostly irrelevant.\n  - For any arbitrary exception, the `Array[StackTraceElements]` returned by `exception.stackTrace()` may be relevant.\n- When there is an error in a streaming query, it's hard to reason whether the `Array[StackTraceElements]` is useful or not.

This is how Spark reported executor stra\n- Hence, this PR simplifies the API by removing the array `stackTrace` from `QueryTerminated`. Instead the `exception` returns a string containing the message and the stack trace of the actual underlying exception that failed the streaming query (i.e. not that of the StreamingQueryException). If anyone is interested in the actual stack trace as an array, can always access them through `streamingQuery.exception` which returns the exception object.\n\nWith this change, if a streaming query fails because of a / by zero exception in a task, the `QueryTerminated.exception` will be\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 1 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 1.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 1, localhost): java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryListenerSuite$$anonfun$5$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$4$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$5.apply$mcII$sp(StreamingQueryListenerSuite.scala:153)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryListenerSuite$$anonfun$5$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$4$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$5.apply(StreamingQueryListenerSuite.scala:153)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryListenerSuite$$anonfun$5$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$4$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$5.apply(StreamingQueryListenerSuite.scala:153)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIterator.processNext(Unknown Source)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anonfun$8$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:370)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$2.apply(SparkPlan.scala:232)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$2.apply(SparkPlan.scala:226)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitionsInternal$1$$anonfun$apply$24.apply(RDD.scala:803)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitionsInternal$1$$anonfun$apply$24.apply(RDD.scala:803)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.MapPartitionsRDD.compute(MapPartitionsRDD.scala:38)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:319)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.iterator(RDD.scala:283)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:70)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:86)\n    at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:274)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1145)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:615)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:744)\n\nDriver stacktrace:\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler.org$apache$spark$scheduler$DAGScheduler$$failJobAndIndependentStages(DAGScheduler.scala:1429)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler$$anonfun$abortStage$1.apply(DAGScheduler.scala:1417)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler$$anonfun$abortStage$1.apply(DAGScheduler.scala:1416)\n    at scala.collection.mutable.ResizableArray$class.foreach(ResizableArray.scala:59)\n    at scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.foreach(ArrayBuffer.scala:48)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler.abortStage(DAGScheduler.scala:1416)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler$$anonfun$handleTaskSetFailed$1.apply(DAGScheduler.scala:802)\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler$$anonfun$handleTaskSetFailed$1.apply(DAGScheduler.scala:802)\n...\n```\n\nIt contains the relevant executor stack trace.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBased on #12990 by @tankkyo\n\nSince the History Server currently loads all application's data it can OOM if too many applications have a significant task count. `spark.ui.trimTasks` (default: false) can be set to true to trim tasks by `spark.ui.retainedTasks` (default: 10000) \n\n(This is a \"quick fix\" to help those running into the problem until a update of how the history server loads app data can be done)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI was looking at the code for UnresolvedOrdinal and made a few small changes to make it slightly more clear:\n1. Rename the rule to SubstituteUnresolvedOrdinals which is more consistent with other rules that start with verbs. Note that this is still inconsistent with CTESubstitution and WindowsSubstitution.\n2. Broke the test suite down from a single test case to three test cases.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a minor

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAllow for pushdown of `IN` clauses. Previous implementations relied upon custom user defined predicates in Parquet, instead here we just convert an IN over a set to an OR over a set of equality expressions, which can be pushed down properly to Parquet.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests from previous PR's, specifically #10278. They pass with the change and fail when the case block is commented out, indicating the pushdown is successfully being applied in Parquet. Because it is a disjunction of equality checks this should be applied at the row group level.\n","created_at":"2016-08-16T19:16:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-18T04:40:35Z","closed_at":"2017-02-18T04:40:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d2f32fa46159e71d781a71a9237a41213310ffa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c9cf7b0ce311c04092fc709318e1697eca1ac01","head":{"label":"a10y:pushdown-in","ref":"pushdown-in","sha":"1c9cf7b0ce311c04092fc709318e1697eca1ac01","user":{"login":"a10y","id":332583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y","html_url":"https://github.com/a10y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39734055,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTczNDA1NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"a10y/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a10y","id":332583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y","html_url":"https://github.com/a10y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a10y/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR splits the generated code for `SafeProjection.apply` by using `ctx.splitExpressions()`. This is because the large code body for `NewInstance` may grow beyond 64KB bytecode size for `apply()` method.\n\nHere is [the original PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13243) for SPARK-15285. However, it breaks a build with Scala 2.10 since Scala 2.10 does not a case class with large number of members. Thus, it was reverted by [this commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/fa244e5a90690d6a31be50f2aa203ae1a2e9a1cf).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new tests by using `DefinedByConstructorParams` instead of case class for scala-2.10\n","created_at":"2016-08-16T19:03:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T13:36:54Z","closed_at":"2016-08-17T13:36:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29bc97135bfe70da740ec45d873e61dfe9eddef2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/86258eb3ca13284ad5593a105b2ddc6d0cde58e4","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-15285-2","ref":"SPARK-15285-2","sha":"86258eb3ca13284ad5593a105b2ddc6d0cde58e4","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to fix an incorrect outer join elimination when filter's `isNotNull` constraints is unable to filter out all null-supplying rows. For example, `isnotnull(coalesce(b#227, c#238))`.\n\nUsers can hit this error when they try to use `using/natural outer join`, which is converted to a normal outer join with a `coalesce` expression on the `using columns`. For example, \n\n``` Scala\n    val a = Seq((1, 2), (2, 3)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\n    val b = Seq((2, 5), (3, 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"c\")\n    val c = Seq((3, 1)).toDF(\"a\", \"d\")\n    val ab = a.join(b, Seq(\"a\"), \"fullouter\")\n    ab.join(c, \"a\").explain(true)\n```\n\nThe dataframe `ab` is doing `using full-outer join`, which is converted to a normal outer join with a `coalesce` expression. Constraints inference generates a `Filter` with constraints `isnotnull(coalesce(b#227, c#238))`. Then, it triggers a wrong outer join elimination and generates a wrong result.\n\n```\nProject [a#251, b#227, c#237, d#247]\n+- Join Inner, (a#251 = a#246)\n   :- Project [coalesce(a#226, a#236) AS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems Spark executes another job to figure out schema always ([ParquetFileFormat#L739-L778](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/abff92bfdc7d4c9d2308794f0350561fe0ceb4dd/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetFileFormat.scala#L739-L778)).\n\nHowever, it seems it's a bit of overhead to touch only a small number of files.\n\nThis PR make Parquet data source touch a small number of files to infer schema within driver-side without launching another Spark job with an new option, `spark.sql.parquet.readSchemaLocalThreshold`.\n\nI ran a benchmark with the code below:\n\n``` scala\ntest(\"Benchmark for Parquet reader\") {\n  withTempPath { path =>\n    Seq((1, 2D, 3L, \"4\")).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\")\n      .write.format(\"parquet\").save(path.getAbsolutePath)\n\n    val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"Parquet - read schema\", 1)\n    benchmark.addCase(\"Parquet - read schema\", 10) { _ =>\n      spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(path.getCanonicalPath).schema\n    }\n    benchmark.run()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwith the results as below:\n- **Before**\n  \n  ```\n  Parquet - read schema:                   Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Parquet - read schema                           47 /   49          0.0    46728419.0       1.0X\n  ```\n- **After**\n  \n  ```\n  Parquet - read schema:                   Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Parquet - read schema                            2 /    3          0.0     1811673.0       1.0X\n  ```\n\nIt seems it became ~25X faster (although It is a small bit in total job run-time).\n\nAs a reference, it seems ORC is doing this within driver-side [OrcFileOperator.scala#L74-L83](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a95252823e09939b654dd425db38dadc4100bc87/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/orc/OrcFileOperator.scala#L74-L83).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this\n","created_at":"2016-08-16T05:54:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:38:32Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T22:41:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67b78fd7bc8b6d6159285a955d9f7ed81d9bd5c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ec13c95d3277c3464c97bd0cdefda10b578eac9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17071","ref":"SPARK-17071","sha":"8ec13c95d3277c3464c97bd0cdefda10b578eac9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Pass `jobId` to Task.\n2. Invoke Hadoop APIs. \n   - A new function `setCallerContext` is added in `Utils`. `setCallerContext` function invokes APIs of   `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.CallerContext` to set up spark caller contexts, which will be written into `hdfs-audit.log` and Yarn RM audit log.\n   - For HDFS: Spark sets up its caller context by invoking`org.apache.hadoop.ipc.CallerContext` in `Task` and Yarn `Client` and `ApplicationMaster`.\n   - For Yarn: Spark sets up its caller context by invoking `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.CallerContext` in Yarn `Client`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual Tests against some Spark applications in Yarn client mode and Yarn cluster mode. Need to check if spark caller contexts are written into HDFS hdfs-audit.log and Yarn RM audit log successfully.\n\nFor example, run SparkKmeans in Yarn client mode: \n\n```\n./bin/spark-submit --verbose --executor-cores 3 --num-executors 1 --master yarn --deploy-mode client --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkKMeans examples/target/original-spark-examples_2.11-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar hdfs://localhost:9000/lr_big.txt 2 5\n```\n\n**Before**:\nThere will be no Spark caller context in records of `hdfs-audit.log` and Yarn RM audit log.\n\n**After**:\nSpark caller contexts will be written in records of `hdfs-audit.log` and Yarn RM audit log.\n\nThese are records in `hdfs-audit.log`:\n\n```\n2016-09-20 11:54:24,116 INFO FSNamesystem.audit: allowed=true   ugi=wyang (auth:SIMPLE)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a field to subquery alias in order to make the usage of views in a resolved `LogicalPlan` more visible (and more understandable).\n\nFor example, the following view and query:\n\n``` sql\ncreate view constants as select 1 as id union all select 1 union all select 42\nselect * from constants;\n```\n\n...now yields the following analyzed plan:\n\n```\nProject [id#39]\n+- SubqueryAlias c, `default`.`constants`\n   +- Project [gen_attr_0#36 AS id#39]\n      +- SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\n         +-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdding partition prunning to Metastore statistics for better join selection.\n\nCurrently the metastore statistics returns the size of entire table which results in Join selection stretagy to not use broadcast joins even when only a single partition from a large table is selected.This PR addresses that issue by only estimating the size of the partition by applying partition pruning during size estimation. Currently it only works with partition columns used with equality checks under AND,OR,IN Operators. If a partition column is used in any other operator, it defaults back to total table size. We have also introduced a configuration to enable this optimization which will be off by default. Instead of trying to calculate the path we could make a metastore query to get all the valid paths but for simplicity we are just building the path in code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests added.\n","created_at":"2016-08-15T22:15:51Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T18:34:06Z","closed_at":"2017-06-14T18:34:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fb91054e7ac74d5734afb92d5f6129c56f7685f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7380d4a3450b985386b2f59516baa50c896c2659","head":{"label":"Parth-Brahmbhatt:Spark-16669","ref":"Spark-16669","sha":"7380d4a3450b985386b2f59516baa50c896c2659","user":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50132357,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDEzMjM1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"Parth-Brahmbhatt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Parth-Brahmbhatt","id":6914358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MTQzNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6914358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt","html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Parth-Brahmbhatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Parth-Brahmbhatt/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdds --conf option to set spark configuration properties in mesos dispacther.\nProperties provided with --conf take precedence over properties within the properties file.\nThe reason for this PR is that for simple configuration or testing purposes we need to provide a property file (ideally a shared one for a cluster) even if we just provide a single property.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDifferent FileFormat implementations may be able to make intelligent decisions about files that will need to be processed as part of a FileSourceScanExec based on the `pushedFilters` available. This PR implements a way to do that pluggably, with an implementation for Parquet that allows applying the summary metadata to prevent task creation.\n\nThis has a few performance benefits:\n1. Reading of files is generally slow, especially for S3. In the current Parquet implementation the summary metadata is not used and so the footers are read directly. This can be very slow for large Parquet datasets, as even as of Hadoop 2.7 S3 reads will read the entire file by default (random reads are configurable only starting on 2.7 onwards, and is disabled by default)\n2. Partitions that are found to contain no files can then be pruned out or coalesced depending on the FileFormat's implementation, allowing for fewer tasks being created.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests and Spark Shell, plus unit test for the Parquet implementation.\n","created_at":"2016-08-15T16:00:24Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T19:41:42Z","closed_at":"2016-11-10T19:41:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21c08e70c835613c80b09d96f8caaa5e353959ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/163af01c7f6a936d72a74e0e0b878c90d3010490","head":{"label":"a10y:parquet-task-pruning","ref":"parquet-task-pruning","sha":"163af01c7f6a936d72a74e0e0b878c90d3010490","user":{"login":"a10y","id":332583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y","html_url":"https://github.com/a10y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39734055,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTczNDA1NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"a10y/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a10y","id":332583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y","html_url":"https://github.com/a10y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a10y/spark","description":"Mirror

The rule will do `transformExpressions` on `LogicalPlan`. The query above contains a `MapGroups` which has a parameter `dataAttributes:Seq[Attribute]`. One attributes in `dataAttributes` will be transformed to an `Alias(literal(0), _)` in `FoldablePropagation`. `Alias` is not an `Attribute` and causes the error.\n\nWe can't easily detect such type inconsistency during transforming expressions. A direct approach to this problem is to skip doing `FoldablePropagation` on object operators as they should not contain such expressions.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n","created_at":"2016-08-15T15:36:50Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:53Z","closed_at":"2016-08-18T05:26:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2427005d5020dd5977d94a3fff1636f5109298b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b688abfc679a98de0ca875a571081993160230b1","head":{"label":"viirya:flat-mapping","ref":"flat-mapping","sha":"b688abfc679a98de0ca875a571081993160230b1","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs README.md file is updated over time. Some code snippet outputs are not correct based on new README.md file. For example:\n\n```\nscala> textFile.count()\nres0: Long = 126\n```\n\nshould be\n\n```\nscala> textFile.count()\nres0: Long = 99\n```\n\nThis pr is to add comments to point out this problem so that new spark learners have a correct reference.\nAlso, fixed a samll bug, inside current documentation, the outputs of linesWithSpark.count() without and with cache are different (one is 15 and the other is 19)\n\n```\nscala> val linesWithSpark = textFile.filter(line => line.contains(\"Spark\"))\nlinesWithSpark: org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[String] = MapPartitionsRDD[2] at filter at <console>:27\n\nscala> textFile.filter(line => line.contains(\"Spark\")).count() // How many lines contain \"Spark\"?\nres3: Long = 15\n\n...\n\nscala> linesWithSpark.cache()\nres7: linesWithSpark.type = MapPartitionsRDD[2] at filter at <console>:27\n\nscala> linesWithSpark.count()\nres8: Long = 19\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual test:  run `$ SKIP_API=1 jekyll serve

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch improves the CrossValidator by adding a new training/validation split method -groupKFold, which splits data based on data group labels and makes sure that the same group is not in both testing and training sets. \nThis is necessary, for example when data is gathered from different subjects, i.e., learning person specific features. This method can create subject independent folds, so that we can train and test the model on different subjects. It will improve the generic ability of the model and avoid over-fitting for these use\ncases.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test added to MLUtilsSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-08-15T02:53:17Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T06:32:31Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T06:32:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e4ff75a2d67abe1bb90d5861f327ffbc68d2669","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21f617403f1a12145959c9fa26ebaa4bf281f6b0","head":{"label":"VinceShieh:labelKFold2","ref":"labelKFold2","sha":"21f617403f1a12145959c9fa26ebaa4bf281f6b0","user":{"login":"VinceShieh","id":2673819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzM4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2673819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh","html_url":"https://github.com/VinceShieh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64914308,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDkxNDMwOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"VinceShieh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VinceShieh","id":2673819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzM4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2673819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh","html_url":"https://github.com/VinceShieh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VinceShieh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VinceShieh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `skip.header.line.count` option support for Hive tables (external and managed).\r\n\r\n- `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` or `CREATE TABLE ... LOCATION` uses external files as a data source for the tables. External files like CSV frequently contains one or more header lines as their own metadata. So, **skip.header.line.count** table property is used in order to exclude those metadata lines from data lines.\r\n- Managed tables also have the same situations to handle files loaded by `LOAD DATA` SQL commands. \r\n\r\n[SPARK-11374](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11374) is a long lasting issue since 1.5.1, and all current Spark versions have the same situation.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example for SPARK-11374.\r\n\r\n**CSV Data**\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ cat /data/test.csv \r\nc1,c2\r\n1,a\r\n2,b\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Scala**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"header\",\"true\").csv(\"/data\").show\r\n+---+---+\r\n| c1| c2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  a|\r\n|  2|  b|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SQL (External Table)**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT, value VARCHAR(10)) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION '/data' TBLPROPERTIES('skip.header.line.count'='1')\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT * FROM t1\").show\r\n+---+-----+\r\n| id|value|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|  1|    a|\r\n|  2|    b|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SQL (Managed Table)**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE t2 (id INT, value VARCHAR(10)) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' TBLPROPERTIES('skip.header.line.count'='1')\")\r\nscala> sql(\"LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/data/test.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE t2\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT * FROM t2\").show\r\n+---+-----+\r\n| id|value|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|  1|    a|\r\n|  2|    b|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins test with a new test case.\r\n","created_at":"2016-08-14T21:31:30Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T02:11:26Z","closed_at":"2016-12-14T18:49:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c03ae4fb49265918177b92bd44ef8979b0c29e21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47ebd2340c0b85b8d1b19661ea5d899e744bc01d","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-11374","ref":"SPARK-11374","sha":"47ebd2340c0b85b8d1b19661ea5d899e744bc01d","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"70c5549ee9588228d18a7b405c977cf591e2efd4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

 \"auto_join1\",\n    \"auto_join10\",\n    \"auto_join11\",\n    \"auto_join12\",\n    \"auto_join13\",\n    \"auto_join14\",\n    \"auto_join14_hadoop20\",\n    \"auto_join15\",\n    \"auto_join17\",\n    \"auto_join18\",\n    \"auto_join2\",\n    \"auto_join20\",\n    \"auto_join21\",\n    \"auto_join23\",\n    \"auto_join24\",\n    \"auto_join3\",\n    \"auto_join4\",\n    \"auto_join5\",\n    \"auto_join6\",\n    \"auto_join7\",\n    \"auto_join8\",\n    \"auto_join9\"\n```\n\nWe can remove all of them without affecting the test coverage. \n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`PySpark` loses `microsecond` precision for some corner cases during converting `Timestamp` into `Long`. For example, for the following `datetime.max` value should be converted a value whose last 6 digits are '999999'. This PR improves the logic not to lose precision for all cases.\n\n**Corner case**\n\n``` python\n>>> datetime.datetime.max\ndatetime.datetime(9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, 999999)\n```\n\n**Before**\n\n``` python\n>>> from datetime import datetime\n>>> from pyspark.sql import Row\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, TimestampType\n>>> schema = StructType([StructField(\"dt\", TimestampType(), False)])\n>>> [schema.toInternal(row) for row in [{\"dt\": datetime.max}]]\n[(253402329600000000,)]\n```\n\n**After**\n\n``` python\n>>> [schema.toInternal(row) for row in [{\"dt\": datetime.max}]]\n[(253402329599999999,)]\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test with a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe can see the DataFrame API:\n`def select(col: String, cols: String*)`\nsuch definition can prevent user to call `select` in such way: `df.select( )`\n\nbut, currently we can still use `df.select( )` and pass compiling, \nbecause it match the API\n`def select(cols: Column*)`\n\nso, my modification is, add an API such as:\n`def select(col: Column, cols: Column*)`\nand change `def select(cols: Column*)` into `private[spark] def select(cols: Column*)`\nso that the public `select` API can only be called with non-empty param list.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up duplicated checking for file paths in implemented data sources and prevent to attempt to list twice in ORC data source.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14585 handles a problem for the partition column name having `_` and the issue itself is resolved correctly. However, it seems the data sources implementing `FileFormat` are validating the paths duplicately. Assuming from the comment in `CSVFileFormat`, `// TODO: Move filtering.`, I guess we don't have to check this duplicately.\r\n   \r\n   Currently, this seems being filtered in `PartitioningAwareFileIndex.shouldFilterOut` and`PartitioningAwareFileIndex.isDataPath`. So, `FileFormat.inferSchema` will always receive leaf files. For example, running to codes below:\r\n   \r\n   ``` scala\r\n   spark.range(10).withColumn(\"_locality_code\", $\"id\").write.partitionBy(\"_locality_code\").save(\"/tmp/parquet\")\r\n
