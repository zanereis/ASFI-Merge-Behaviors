For some unknown reason `startupFailsGivenPortAlreadyInUse` started to\r\n  fail after a seemingly innocuous Ubuntu base image bump. The problem\r\n  may also have been triggered by arbitrary test ordering changes since\r\n  the test did not fail on its own, but only in conjunction with running\r\n  other tests beforehand.\r\n  Specifically, the test was failing when binding the interfering port\r\n  (bind exception). The port used was always in the TIME_WAIT state left\r\n  from previous tests.\r\n  Using a `ServerSocket`, instead of a regular socket, fixes the problem\r\n  since it actually 'uses' the port and implicitly allows for port\r\n  reuse.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

` failed in CI because it accidentally\nconnected to a locator from another test\n(`ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest`).\n\nCAUSE\n\n`ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest` attempts to restart a\nlocator on a port in the ephemeral port range.\n\nHere is the sequence of events:\n1. `ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest ` started a locator on an\n   ephemeral port. In this CI run it got port 37877.\n2. `ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest` stopped the locator on port\n   37877.\n3. `DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest` started a locator on an ephemeral\n   port. In this CI run it got 37877.\n4. `ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest ` attempted to restart the\n   locator on port 37877. That port was already in use in\n   `DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest`'s locator, and as a result the two\n   tests became entangled.\n\nCONTRIBUTING FACTORS\n\n`DistTXPersistentDebugDUnitTest` uses `DUnitLauncher` to start its\nlocator. By default, `DUnitLauncher` starts its locator on an ephemeral\nport.\n\n`ClusterConfigLocatorRestartDUnitTest` uses `ClusterStartupRule` to\nstart several locators. By default, `ClusterStartupRule` starts each\nlocator on an ephemeral port.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange `DUnitLauncher` and `ClusterStartupRule` to assign locator ports\nvia `AvailablePortHelper` if the test does not specify a particular\nport.\n\nI considered changing only `ClusterConfigLogatorRestartDUnitTest` to\nassign the port that it intends to reuse. But:\n- That would fix only this one test, though an unknown number of tests\n  similarly attempt to reuse ports assigned by framework code. Numerous\n  of those tests have already been changed to assign ports explicitly,\n  but an unknown number remain.\n- It is quite reasonable for this test and others to assume that, if the\n  test framework assigns a port on the test's behalf, then the test will\n  enjoy exclusive use of that port for the entire life of the test. I\n  think the key problem is not that tests make this assumption, but that\n  the framework code violates it.\n\nChanging the test framework classes that tacitly assign ports\n(`DUnitLauncher` and `ClusterStartupRule`) makes them behave in a way\nthat tests expect.\n","created_at":"2021-12-08T21:30:33Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T17:53:21Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T17:53:17Z","merged_at":"2021-12-09T17:53:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"68b9080e84054f059b8c3e9b4aff9034fb302353","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mhansonp","id":26558973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTU4OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26558973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp","html_url":"https://github.com/mhansonp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhansonp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2387116680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg3MTE2Njgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"4d86eb","default":false,"description":"add

OpLog files are compacted, but the .drf file is left because it contains deletes of \r\nentries in previous .crfs. The .crf file is deleted, but the orphaned .drf is not until all \r\nprevious .crf files (.crfs with smaller id) are deleted.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that compacted Oplog object representing orphaned .drf file holds\r\na structure in memory (Oplog.regionMap) that contains information that is not useful \r\nafter the compaction and it takes certain amount of memory. Besides, there is a special \r\ncase when creating .krf files that, depending on the execution order, \r\ncould make the problem more severe (it could leave pendingKrfTags structure\r\non the regionMap and this could take up a significant amount of memory). This\r\npendingKrfTags HashMap is actually empty, but consumes memory because it was used\r\npreviously and the size of the HashMap was not reduced after it is cleared.\r\nThis special case usually happens when new Oplog is rolled out and previous Oplog \r\nis immediately marked as eligible for compaction. Compaction and .krf creation start at \r\nthe similar time and compactor cancels creation of .krf file. \r\nThe pendingKrfTags structure is usually cleared when .krf file is created, but since \r\ncompaction canceled creation of .krf, the pendingKrfTags structure remain in memory \r\nuntil Oplog representing orphaned .drf file is deleted.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nClear the regionMap data structure of the Oplog when it is compacted (currently it is\r\ndeleted when the Oplog is destroyed).\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Alberto Gomez <alberto.gomez@est.tech>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`DeployedJarTest`, which intermittently throws\n`DirectoryNotEmptyException` on Windows.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n`DeployedJarTest` uses Geode's custom Java compiler to create jar files.\nWhen the compiler finishes compiling, it calls Apache commons\n`FileUtils.deleteDirectory(dir)` to delete the temporary files it\ncreated during compilation.\n\n`FileUtils.deleteDirectory(dir)` first \"cleans\" `dir` by recursively\nremoving all files from it, then deletes `dir` itself. On Windows,\ndeleting `dir` sometimes throws `DirectoryNotEmptyException` even though\n`FileUtils` has cleaned the directory. I do not know the cause of this.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange our custom Java compiler to create temporary files in memory\ninstead of on the file system.  That way there are no file system files\nto

In test JVMs, `AvailablePortHelper` initialized its next candidate\n  port by selecting a random port within the available port range. This\n  often caused the test JVM's first few candidates to overlap with the\n  first few candidates of a child VM.\n- `AvailablePortHelper` updated its next candidate port in non-atomic\n  way, making it possible for multiple threads to receive the same port\n  number.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nChange `AvailablePortHelper` to:\n- Initialize its next candidate port to `AVAILABLE_PORT_LOWER_BOUND`\n

test has a number of problems, in addition to the flakiness described in the bug report, to wit:\r\n\r\n- The comment “Demonstrate that a new UDP port is used…” is at odds with the assertion at the end of the method (which asserts that the same port is used).\r\n- Contrary to the comment, GMSMembership doesn’t “shun” members when they are shutting down, rather it keeps them in a shutdownMembers set so as to attenuate failure detection signals from them. Perhaps in the dim past these members were actually “shunned”?\r\n- I have no idea why the test disconnect()s, then re-acquires system and membership and then disconnect()s again before calling getLocalMember() on the membership acquired before the second disconnect!\r\n- The TODO at line 167 seems superfluous since we proceed to set just such a system property on the very next line\r\n- Whether the property is set or not, on line 168, the test passes! (at least in manual runs)—implying that setting that system property is superfluous.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to believe this test is worthless and the best fix for GEODE-9675 is to delete this test.\r\n\r\nThis PR deletes the test.\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
