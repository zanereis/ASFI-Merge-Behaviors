(almost).\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the task runner's `run` function to handle when an AirflowSkipException is thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Extended the task runner with the right `msg` when a AirflowSkipException is thrown\r\n2. Added a test in the `test_handle_requests` test of supervisor to show that no `client` call is made from `handle_requests` but is instead controlled by the `wait` function.\r\n3. Added an example DAG that throws AirflowSkipException and the task runner test that handles that.\r\n\r\nPostman working example:\r\n1. Create a DAG run:\r\n<img width=\"1709\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e23388fb-db2d-446b-bfa5-6da1a5710a82\">\r\n\r\n2. Login into metadata DB and get the task_id for the task you want to skip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7166c3fc-4106-441a-b682-6450a5783e9a)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Once you have the task_id, send a patch request like this:\r\n```\r\ncurl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:29091/execution/task-instances/0193ab1b-df6a-72bb-b888-04c541e6bf12/state' \\\r\n--data '{\r\n    \"state\": \"skipped\",\r\n    \"end_date\": \"2024-10-31T12:00:00Z\"\r\n}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e127f65-b7e1-48f4-a909-29d34f09f11c)\r\n\r\n4.

test_reading_from_pipes can sometimes return the logs in a different order, because the order in which messages will be read from stdout and stderr and values are put in the log are not deterministic. Unfortunately this is comparing list of dicts and dicts are not hashable, so we cannot use the usual trick of converting the list to set. Instead we are using \"pytest-unordered\" library that implements `unordered` helper to run such asserts.\r\n\r\nThe native pytest for unordered collection comparision is highly requested but apparently stalled by maintainers.

there is a test that does not allow pytest command to quit cleanly, in case of parallell commands, we have no chance to see the outputs of test command that failed, because whole CI job is cancelled and we only upload the logs on failure in the following step of the job.\r\n\r\nAdding timeout for parallel tests that is a little shorter than the job timeout will give a chance for our tests to get cancelled before the job timeout occur, and even if we will not see the logs in the output of the cancelled `breeze testing` command, the logs should be uploaded as artifacts in this case.\r\n\r\nAlso we are serving \"cancelled\" status of job, because it's likely\r\nthat will also be possible to do \"something\" in case test gets\r\ncancelled due to timeout.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache

~2.7, we moved provider config from core into the providers themselves. However, if providers that were released before that change was used on 2.7+, there could be failures because the config wouldn't be in those providers! So, we added a fallback for all of the configs that were moved.\r\n\r\nAs we move toward Airflow 3, we don't need to carry this baggage forever. This does mean provider released in earlier than mid 2023 won't work with Airflow 3 (and I'd imagine there will be other reasons they wont work as

up of #44464.\r\n\r\nIn #44464, we copied a minimal version of the Flask application in FAB provider to support Airflow 2 plugins. This Flask application required assets (like the Flask application in core).\r\n\r\nIn this PR I update the script `compile_www_assets.py` to also generate the assets for the Flash application in FAB provider. \r\n\r\nFor later: when the current UI is gone, we'll be able to stop generating the assets for the main Flask application in core (then maybe move the script to FAB provider?).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

From what I understood, it seems that the task fails when the request to get the refresh status is \"too fast\" (right after the refresh creation) and the API does not recognize the refreshId.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I suggest to add a retry decorator on the function that requests the refresh status, as well as an `api_timeout` variable (stored in a field in both the trigger and the operator). This way, if the first request fails to get the refresh status, other requests are sent (during a period of `api_timeout` seconds).\r\n\r\nFor example, here is what the logs could look like (in case of failure):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a82edae-4005-43fb-adbd-8d8f6bf26f96)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

As multiple threads where trying to get a connection through the jaydebeapi libary, we sometimes got random \"OSError: JVM is already started\" errors, due to the high concurrency/parallelism, something you won't experience if you do the same using the expand mapped task as each task instance is then run on a different Python process.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue I made the get_conn method of the JdbcHook synchronized and added a unit test which simulates the behaviour to avoid regression in the future so this is well documented through a test.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above

S3 asset import had a conditional code to import assets but\r\nit is unnecessary, because the compatibility code is added to\r\ncommon.compat provider - but only in the upcoming version so we have\r\nto make sure that common.compat is added to \"chicken-egg\" providers,\r\nso that constaraints are properly generated for PyPI packages.\r\n\r\nThis is also the case where we can bump manually provider version\r\nwithout waiting for release time - because we need to depend on the\r\nnew provider version in amazon provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

of having a separate class for condition evaluation, we can just use the main AssetAlias class directly.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses: #44359 \r\n\r\n### Why is it needed?\r\nThe change is needed so that we can support templating `rendered_fields` with the airflow tasks. We can provide jinja templated values for the fields that support templating, like `bash_command` for BashOperator or `op_kwargs` for PythonOperator. Example DAG:\r\n```\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    'simple_bash_dag',\r\n    default_args=default_args,\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    def _extract_data(current_dag_run_date):\r\n        print(\"the date is\", current_dag_run_date)\r\n\r\n\r\n    PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"extract_task\",\r\n        python_callable=_extract_data,\r\n        op_kwargs={\r\n            \"current_dag_run_date\": \"{{ds}}\"\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Brief of changes\r\n\r\n#### Execution API\r\nAdded an endpoint under task_instances route to be able to set rendered task instance fields. This will be called by the task runner (actually task directly)\r\n\r\nThe intended call flow would be like so:\r\n1. Task proc launches, waits for StartupDetails\r\n2. Supervisor sends that\r\n3. Task parses dag, gets task\r\n4. Task sends RTIF up to supervisor\r\n5. Supervisor sends start request inc. RTIF\r\n6. Task only executes task when it gets response\r\n\r\nSo the execution API need not care about what data has come in, all it cares is if the task sent the data in form of:\r\n`dict[<field>: <rendered format of the field>]`. The job of rendering is of the task itself.\r\n\r\nAdded a RootModel instead of a BaseModel to avoid an uneccesary level in the request.\r\n\r\n#### Client\r\nAdding the client endpoint for `set_rtif`. This will send an API call to the execution API to set RTIF for a task instance.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### Testing the API directly using API client like postman\r\n1. Go to your Airflow UI and run any DAG you wish with atleast one normal task. I am using this one:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0845184-b980-4c52-bde4-3b6ebe02aeee)\r\n\r\n2. Gather the dag id, run id, task id from the UI\r\n\r\n3. Go to your metadata DB and get the `id` for the task instance from the `task_instance` table.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/258a177f-84dd-4b39-a27d-3304cbe27f1c)\r\n\r\n4. Send the PUT request. I am using postman\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11e94613-472a-43fd-bf26-39e6944ad7e2)\r\n\r\n5. Check the RTIF table\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/579cd437-b154-4a94-9c7a-bc72c78e845e)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd201663-4245-4c30-9c9a-40f0f7927388)\r\n\r\n<!--

The test is legistimate (it’s for a custom operator only used on task execution), but we need to mock those db calls instead.\r\n\r\nCalls that need db are now always done lazily (when Airflow core is available), and functions all moved to `airflow.models` and tested there instead.\r\n\r\nA Pytest hook is also added to check the `db_test` marker does not exist, to ensure this does not happen

PR introduces consistent way of checking version of Airflow\r\nby Airflow providers. So far there were about 6 different ways on\r\nhow Providers checked for Airflow version - this PR aims to unify\r\nthis approach for now and in the future - at least until minimum\r\nversion of Airflow set to 2.11 where we are likely to introduce\r\na simpler check via https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44607. Until then all providers are going\r\nto have `version_references.py` module copied in their sources\r\nthat they will be importing the constants from.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds pre-commit that checks if the\r\n``version_compat.py`` module is imported from local package copy\r\nor maybe from another provider or test code - both causing\r\nunneeded dependencies from the provider - to another package or\r\nto test code respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Why\r\nWhen the user has airflow < 2.10 installed, a provider that has not yet renamed datasets as assets (e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-amazon==8.28.0`) and `apache-airflow-providers-common-compat>=1.2.1` (with asset rename backward compatibility layer.), the user will get the following `hook_lineage_collector` after calling `get_hook_lineage_collector`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    class NoOpCollector:\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        NoOpCollector is a hook lineage collector that does nothing.\r\n\r\n        It is used when you

pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the provider has not yet been updated to use asset methods, it is still called `add_input_dataset`, which causes an AttributeError as `add_input_dataset` does not exist in the returned `NoOpCollector`\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\nadd back `add_input_dataset` and `add_output_dataset` for backward compat\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n

PR adds a request-reply operator to implement the design pattern from Enterprise Integration Patterns, Hohpe, Woolf,\r\n   Addison-Wesley, 2003\r\n\r\nIn particular, this means one could:\r\na) Create a service bus queue and topic for a batch process\r\nb) set up an auto-scaling Azure Container Job listening to an Azure Service Bus queue for messages\r\nc) create a DAG using the request-reply operator to start the Azure Container Job and capture the reply when it finishes.\r\n\r\nPotential improvements:\r\n* have the operator background itself while waiting for a reply. No need to tie up a worker thread while a remote process runs\r\n* Provide more parameters to control the subscription to the reply queue. Right now it deregisters itself if not used for 6 hours and drops messages after 1 hour. This seems reasonable to me since this subscription should only exist for the life of the operator, but more configuration might help some use case I haven't thought of.\r\n\r\n\r\nA working Azure Container App Job can be built using the scripts/event-job-aca.zsh in the repo https://github.com/perry2of5/http-file-rtrvr\r\n\r\nA working DAG is provided below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import
