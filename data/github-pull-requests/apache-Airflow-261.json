Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5109\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nairflow.utils.helpers.reap_process_group() can throw uncaught OSErrors\r\nif processes exit at the wrong time in its execution. Fix this by\r\ncatching all OSErrors that can arise due to a process race, and\r\nreturning from them when the error is ESRCH (process not found).\r\n\r\nTraceback from a production system can be found in the JIRA above.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nthis functionality is already tested in `tests.utils.test_helpers`; reproducibly testing for additional cases in a process race can only be done with substantially more complicated tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nNo new functionality, so no new docs.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

is an important decision that can result in tasks mysteriously not being run. At least airflow can log this decision (debug level).\r\n\r\nThis PR skips the template ceremony - I have no expectation that it will be merged as-is. This PR is in lieu of an issue. If the project maintainers value a system that communicates **critical scheduling\r\ndecisions**, here's an example of how to improve airflow to help users troubleshoot what is often baffling behavior.\r\n\r\nFor the record, the driver for this was the *extremely* subtle behavior in trigger_dag:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if not execution_date:\r\n        execution_date = timezone.utcnow()\r\n\r\n    assert timezone.is_localized(execution_date)\r\n\r\n    if replace_microseconds:\r\n        execution_date = execution_date.replace(microsecond=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the microsecond component of `execution_date` is dropped (by default, for whatever reason) it causes that value to slip behind the current time. That can tasks cause DAGs that use the current time to be skipped - without notice of any kind. This was *time consuming* to debug. At the very least airflow can provide some information to help users solve these problems.","created_at":"2019-08-04T13:18:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-19T21:16:24Z","closed_at":"2019-12-19T21:16:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ddd410ec17ea40b81e4b9d11e4cee401a794267f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5103\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMatching the style of the [PubSubSensor|https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/airflow/contrib/sensors/pubsub_sensor.html], we should make the GoogleCloudStoragePrefixSensor return the list of matches so that downstream tasks don't have to duplicate the Sensor's logic and can instead grab matching GCS objets via XCom.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- test_gcs_sensor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAfter the scheduler has the --do_pickle option turned on, the scheduler will insert all the file pickles into the database each time it scans the file, which will cause the database to swell rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the main reason is because the hash function that determines whether the dag is the same as the pickle version uses the last_loaded field, which changes every time it is read instead of modified. Therefore, airflow inserts a large amount of unchanging data into the database.\r\n\r\nI created a commit in which the last modified time of the file was used instead of last_loaded as the hash field, which works fine on my computer. Please let me know if you have a better way.\r\n\r\nEnglish is not my native language; please excuse typing errors.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis is an enhancement to existing features, I don't think there is no need for additional testing.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4462\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change address the fact that we need to use datetime2 when using MSSQL server as a backend. pyodbc uses microseconds which datetime doesn't support. One of the sideeffects of this is that trigger dag does not work. Details in JIRA.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nPlease note that pylint fails for this since it has poor support for alembic. One way to solve this is to ignore the alembic.op module in pylintrc.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-01T13:42:40Z","updated_at":"2019-09-07T21:26:29Z","closed_at":"2019-08-23T10:36:43Z","merged_at":"2019-08-23T10:36:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"93ca8b87a05d06ea992d88046fb8fddd96d0d50c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c9e423984dc3880269ecadfa570a4b0b6d3b7364","head":{"label":"namhdp:airflow-4462","ref":"airflow-4462","sha":"c9e423984dc3880269ecadfa570a4b0b6d3b7364","user":{"login":"namhdp","id":47819144,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3ODE5MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47819144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp","html_url":"https://github.com/namhdp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195372979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTUzNzI5Nzk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"namhdp/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"namhdp","id":47819144,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3ODE5MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47819144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp","html_url":"https://github.com/namhdp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namhdp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/namhdp/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) \r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n\r\nI don't have permission to create new AIP. What shoud I do?\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. I implemented Ingress for k8s CI.\r\n1. I implemented it to be able to define Namespace for k8s CI.\r\n1. Fix a subcommand for `airflow user` in [airflow-test-env-init.sh#L28](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/airflow-test-env-init.sh#L28). `--create` doesn't work. 'create' is valid.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI tested the changes with the following 3 commands.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# use a default namespace, without Ingress\r\n$ ./scripts/ci/kubernetes/kube/deploy.sh -d persistent_mode\r\n# use a namespace named \"airflow\", without Ingress\r\n$ ./scripts/ci/kubernetes/kube/deploy.sh -d persistent_mode -n airflow\r\n# use a namespace named \"airflow\", with Ingress\r\n$ ./scripts/ci/kubernetes/kube/deploy.sh -d persistent_mode -n airflow -i {YOUR_HOSTNAME}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `kubectl get all -n {NAMESPACE}`\r\n- `kubectl get ingress -n {NAMESPACE}`\r\n- Browse WEB UI\r\n\r\nThey work for me without errors.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-01T07:13:45Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T04:20:13Z","closed_at":"2019-08-01T10:29:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9bd97afbe16f0daef2caf30d0a203c663baf480","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f10a139eacba13596fa2a1ea8630a484925a3a0b","head":{"label":"Esfahan:implement_ingress_k8s","ref":"implement_ingress_k8s","sha":"f10a139eacba13596fa2a1ea8630a484925a3a0b","user":{"login":"Esfahan","id":14991086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTkxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14991086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan","html_url":"https://github.com/Esfahan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":198747775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NDc3NzU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"Esfahan/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Esfahan","id":14991086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTkxMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14991086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan","html_url":"https://github.com/Esfahan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Esfahan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Esfahan/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5080\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen I run [scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/build.sh](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.3/scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/build.sh#L45) to build Docker Image, I encountered the following error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunning compile_assets\r\n./airflow/www_rbac/compile_assets.sh: 26: ./airflow/www_rbac/compile_assets.sh: npm: not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, http://YOUR_HOSTNAME/static didn't create. I got `500 Internal Server Error` with it on a browser(Chrome).\r\n\r\nI think it needs to install npm in [scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/compile.sh](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.3/scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/compile.sh#L30).\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git nodejs\r\n+apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git nodejs npm\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works for me.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI could see the top page without `500 Internal Server Error` by /static dir that doesn't exist.\r\nI didn't encounter any error with running [scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/build.sh](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.10.3/scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/build.sh#L45).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-31T07:33:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-24T04:42:03Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T13:51:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6836fc58b73ee49df3cfcb2aa341fb0fde2dd40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1503850370,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTAzODUwMzcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-env","name":"area:dev-env","color":"eacf35","default":false,"description":"CI,

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nLet HttpHook handle connections with empty host fields, which would throw an exception previously:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/airflow/hooks/http_hook.py\", line 63, in get_conn\r\n    if \"://\" in conn.host:\r\nTypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- `test_connection_without_host`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\nNo docs; trivial change\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\nLet HttpHook handle connections with empty host fields\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-30T17:42:55Z","updated_at":"2019-07-31T13:42:12Z","closed_at":"2019-07-31T08:17:52Z","merged_at":"2019-07-31T08:17:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"63765487bb75e056ca12700d6c97c1e622d378cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f24ff73e65833ea1c6a7e65e66ba0e94d887b0b6","head":{"label":"pgagnon:fix-http-hook-conn-wo-host","ref":"fix-http-hook-conn-wo-host","sha":"f24ff73e65833ea1c6a7e65e66ba0e94d887b0b6","user":{"login":"pgagnon","id":12717218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzE3MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12717218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon","html_url":"https://github.com/pgagnon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":129795764,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjk3OTU3NjQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"pgagnon/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgagnon","id":12717218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzE3MjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12717218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon","html_url":"https://github.com/pgagnon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgagnon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgagnon/airflow","description":"Apache

again.\n\n  The reason I am removing them is that `email_backend` of `airflow.utils.send_email_smtp` has been incorrect since 1.7.2(!) but hasn't mattered until #5379 somehow triggered it. By removing the default values it should make it easier to update in future.  \n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] No tests, but should still pass :)\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\n\n### Jira\n\n- [x]  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5050\n\n### Description\n\n- [x] Without this fix we can end up in the situation where trying to delete throws an error:\n\n    > psycopg2.IntegrityError: update or delete on table\n    > \"ab_permission_view\" violates foreign key constraint\n    > \"ab_permission_view_role_permission_view_id_fkey\" on table\n    > \"ab_permission_view_role\"\n    > DETAIL:  Key (id)=(57) is still referenced from table\n    \"ab_permission_view_role\".\n\n### Tests\n\n- [x] No unit tests added as it's hard to get the table in to this state. I _could_ add one if we think it's worth it\n\n### Commits\n\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\n\n### Documentation\n\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\n\n### Code Quality\n\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4451\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPR #4691 introduced an issue where named tuples were inadvertently converted to a list of rendered entities. This then made subsequent attribute access on what was assumed to be a named tuple fail, since the object was actually a list.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import namedtuple\r\n\r\nTest = namedtuple('Test', ['foo', 'bar'])\r\nt = Test(1, 2)\r\n\r\nt = render_template(t)  # `t` is now a list of [1, 2]\r\nprint(t.foo)  # This fails after rendering\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an additional clause in the base render function to catch named tuples, and re-instantiate them as the proper class after variable rendering.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis adds another clause to the python operator tests to ensure that rendered `op_args` that are named tuples are still preserved.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5056\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWith these changes this hook now provides a way to retrieve attachments of specific mails by exposing the `mail_filter`. This filter gets passed to the [search](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/imaplib.html#imaplib.IMAP4.search) function. For example you can now pass a filter like this: \r\n```\r\nmail_filter = '(SINCE \"{{ macros.ds_format(ds, \"%Y-%m-%d\", \"%d-%b-%Y\") }}\" ' \\\r\n              'BEFORE \"{{ macros.ds_format(macros.ds_add(ds, 3), \"%Y-%m-%d\", \"%d-%b-%Y\") }}\")'\r\n```\r\nto search only in mails that are between a specific start and end date during a dag run.\r\n\r\nThese changes also includes:\r\n- changes the order of arguments for `has_mail_attachment`, `retrieve_mail_attachments` and `download_mail_attachments`\r\n- add `get_conn` function\r\n- refactor code\r\n- fix pylint issues\r\n- add imap_mail_filter arg to ImapAttachmentToS3Operator\r\n- add mail_filter arg to ImapAttachmentSensor\r\n- remove superfluous tests\r\n- changes the order of arguments in the sensors + operators __init__\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIgnore `node_modules` that are coming from `1.10` and older where the `rbac` UI was in `www_rbac`.\r\n\r\nSo by merging this change we can switch from `1.10` to `master` and run the same docker ci pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

MySqlToHiveTransfer Operator\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5053\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/operators/mysql_to_hive.py#L125\r\n\r\nMySqlToHiveTransfer uses csv.wirter under the hood, however, when MySql table includes Json columns, it'll by default double quotes when encountering csv quotechar or special char, but it doesn't transfer it back (\"\" double quotes remains) when loading to Hive tables, causing invalid Json payload in hive columns.\r\n```\r\ne.g. '[\"true\"]' (MySql) => '[\"\"true\"\"]' (Hive, invalid json payload)\r\n```\r\nIn our case, we fixed it by creating our own customized MySqlToHiveTransfer Operator by overriding the original class's execute method, basically replacing the csv writer with our own configs.\r\n```\r\n// configure csv_writer for supporting json columns\r\ncsv_writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=self.delimiter,\r\n\t\tquoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE,\r\n\t\tquotechar='',\r\n\t\tescapechar='@',\r\n\t\tencoding=\"utf-8\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apahe.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5055) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5055\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen `AIRFLOW_KUBERNETES_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES__AIRFLOW_HOME` is set in\r\nthe scheduler, `AIRFLOW_HOME` should be set for workers, not airflow_home. This means `kubernetes_environment_variables` section's keys need to be parsed with case sensitivity.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUpdated test in `test_env_var_config` to capture the requirement.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - fix missing comment for parameter `annotations` in `KubernetesPodOperator`\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - only fixed comment\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-26T17:04:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T08:24:17Z","closed_at":"2019-07-29T08:24:17Z","merged_at":"2019-07-29T08:24:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae957e7de7289dd9f9879fa4e8feb2ff46d58f6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5fe552e79c262fac690fefa5870cd09c85ccc62c","head":{"label":"ljq0002:add-comment-for-KubernetesPodOperator-constructor","ref":"add-comment-for-KubernetesPodOperator-constructor","sha":"5fe552e79c262fac690fefa5870cd09c85ccc62c","user":{"login":"ljq0002","id":13183346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgzMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13183346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002","html_url":"https://github.com/ljq0002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":198856756,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg4NTY3NTY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ljq0002/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ljq0002","id":13183346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTgzMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13183346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002","html_url":"https://github.com/ljq0002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ljq0002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ljq0002/airflow","description":"Apache

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4981\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4788\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn certain situations, like when using fixed cron schedules such as `0\r\n12 * * *`, the `execution_date`, `prev_execution_date`, and\r\n`next_execution_date` variables in macros were native python `datetime`\r\nobjects instead of, as stated in the docs, pendulum `DateTime` objects.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests \r\n  - `tests.models.test_taskinstance:TaskInstanceTest.test_pendulum_template_dates`\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-24T14:29:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-28T18:51:06Z","closed_at":"2019-07-28T18:51:06Z","merged_at":"2019-07-28T18:51:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab63c26e9dea054225c9caca69ce6dfebcb096d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5654/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5654/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5654/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8156af3f40e17fc2f2b22011a9b8dbda7990cf18","head":{"label":"arlopurcell:jira/2/AIRFLOW-4981","ref":"jira/2/AIRFLOW-4981","sha":"8156af3f40e17fc2f2b22011a9b8dbda7990cf18","user":{"login":"arlopurcell","id":8958229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTgyMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8958229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell","html_url":"https://github.com/arlopurcell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197392092,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTczOTIwOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"arlopurcell/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arlopurcell","id":8958229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTgyMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8958229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell","html_url":"https://github.com/arlopurcell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arlopurcell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arlopurcell/airflow","description":"Apache

Currently, this is not possible for ECS tasks.\r\n\r\nThe SageMaker operator starts a job on AWS SageMaker. It already supports grabbing the CloudWatch logs of the (finished) job to the Airflow instance.\r\n\r\nThe ECS operator is very similar in that it starts a job on AWS ECS. It doesn't, however, support grabbing CloudWatch logs at the end of a job.\r\n\r\nI've separated the existing log grabbing of the SageMaker hook to a separate logs hook and both the SageMaker hook and ECS operator now call that logs hook at the end of a job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n\r\nAdded: `tests.contrib.hooks.TestAwsLogsHook`\r\nChanged: `tests.contrib.hooks.TestSageMakerHook`\r\nChanged: `tests.contrib.sensors.TestSageMakerTrainingSensor`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code

this dependency is only used in setup.py\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5021) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5021\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ngitpython is included as `install_requires` but is only used in setup.py. It's better to move it to `setup_requires` so we can reduce package size.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt only touches setup.py :)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-22T21:58:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-24T12:19:21Z","closed_at":"2019-07-24T12:19:20Z","merged_at":"2019-07-24T12:19:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"32847180b68def10422649725ce0c714119d9305","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9d97b09c93cb863b2b55ca5caa6efca2a918fb91","head":{"label":"houqp:setup","ref":"setup","sha":"9d97b09c93cb863b2b55ca5caa6efca2a918fb91","user":{"login":"houqp","id":670302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDMwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp","html_url":"https://github.com/houqp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":198306469,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTgzMDY0Njk=","name":"airflow","full_name":"houqp/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"houqp","id":670302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDMwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp","html_url":"https://github.com/houqp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/houqp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/houqp/airflow","description":"Apache

https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CCQ7EGB1P/p1559134166151100 to include 'params' as a templated_fields has to modified a bit to solve the issue.\r\n\r\nThe discussed approaches templates the params dict. However, to make in available for the other templated fields in the operators, it is also required to update the jinja_template_context with the rendered params dict.  \r\n\r\nHence, params templates

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes
