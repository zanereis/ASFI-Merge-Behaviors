SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements conditional formatting component, which is going to be added to Pivot Table v2 and Table charts.\r\nFeatures:\r\n- 10 comparator functions (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=, < x <, <= x <, < x <=, <= x <=)\r\n- 3 color schemes (green, yellow and red). Alpha channel is calculated dynamically based on a field's value compared to extreme values in data array used to construct the chart and selected comparator. For example, if we create a formatter \"if count > 10 then green\", values close to 10 will be light green (with low alpha) and values close to the largest value in table will be darker green. On the other hand, if we create a formatter \"if count < 0 then red\", values close to 0 will be light red and values close to the smallest negative value in table will be darker red.\r\n- can add multiple formatters to a single column (e.g. \"if count < 10 then red\" and \"if count > 20 then green\")\r\n- values validation for \"between\" comparators - left value must be smaller than the right value\r\n- Column, Colour scheme and Operator have preselected default values when creating a new formatter (default is the first available option)\r\n\r\nThis PR does NOT add conditional formatting to any chart - it's a prerequisite for follow up PRs to superset-ui repo, which will add conditional formatting to Table and Pivot Table v2 charts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nFixes a bug where some tabs couldn't be deleted due to native filters that point to no-longer existing charts within the tab.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the acute issue, but there's room for improvement! Whenever a chart is removed, we should\r\n1) confirm that no filter is scoped to that missing chart any longer.\r\n2) (optional) if the filter no longer has ANY charts within scope, we could ask the user if they want to delete it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125387559-5d31b580-e35b-11eb-82a7-eb54af3fa94f.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/125387575-628f0000-e35b-11eb-9f80-5a17ed4a6c87.gif)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTo repro the issue (prior to this PR):\r\n\r\n1) Make a dashboard\r\n2) Add tabs\r\n3) Add a chart to a tab (I just used a table)\r\n4) Add a native filter scoped to that chart.\r\n5) (Problem 1) Try to delete the tab containing the chart with the scoped filter. You get an ugly error.\r\n6) Remove the chart with the scoped filter, optionally saving the dash\r\n7) (Problem 2) Try to delete the tab again. Even with the chart gone, you still can't remove the tab.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, you should be able to remove the tab _with or without_ the chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWe noticed that large dashboards were repeatedly requesting the same datasource metadata regardless of whether multiple slices shared the same datasource. This PR updates the logic (though less pretty) to ensure that when building the mapping of slices by datasource [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/models/slice.py#L120-L123) query isn't called unnecessarily. \r\n\r\nThe solution was to merely create a dictionary which is _equivalently_ keyed by `(datasource_type, datasource_id)`  from which the datasource object is only fetched once.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested with `SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = True` and confirmed that the number of database queries was significantly reduced.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

SUMMARY\r\nWe've been having infinite spinners in our superset instance because static resources have been returned with an html file instead. I suspected these static resources are 404ing, but when looking at the superset pods, the resources did exist. Since doing a force refresh resolves the bug, i'm thinking we may have cached the 404 page response, perhaps when a user was loading superset during a deploy. Investigation shows that the 404 page was being returned with a 200 status code and caching headers, so at the very least we should return the proper status code here. And hopefully this will resolve our infinite spinner bugs too.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to a non existent page in superset, see the 404 page is returned with status code 404\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"786\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-09 at 9 26 45 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCreated a `styledComponent` to set hight and center numbers on the `count-badge` on `dataset-tabs`. Also added inline `css={{...align-items:center}}` to parent div - centers badge and tab-title.\r\n\r\nRemoved inline `css` from `EditDatasetModals`'s `Icon.Trash`.

this fix won't be visible because since 1.2.0 there is a bug where anonymous users receive an Unexpected Error when viewing a dashboard, however, it will be fixed in #15585\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis problem had already been fixed in #8527, however, the value of `dashboard.userId` is now being converted into a string [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/301b94f49abef8a2d8e680fcd1c636be6cd45fa4/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/actions/hydrate.js#L339), so in cases of an anonymous user, its value will be `\"undefined\"`.\r\nWith this, the fav star component will render due to [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/301b94f49abef8a2d8e680fcd1c636be6cd45fa4/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/components/Header/index.jsx#L407) condition.\r\n\r\nMy changes:\r\nSince [hydrate.js](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/301b94f49abef8a2d8e680fcd1c636be6cd45fa4/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/actions/hydrate.js#L339) says that `dashboard.userId` is legacy, I pass the value of `user.userId` as a prop to the header component, which is value is `undefined` when there is no user logged in.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add the permission mentioned in [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14912#issuecomment-876377800) comment to the public role OR set PUBLIC_ROLE_LIKE = \"Gamma\"\r\n2. Create a dashboard if don't have any\r\n3. Copy the URL for the dashboard \r\n4. Logout or enter an anonymous browser session\r\n5. Enter in the dashboard's URL\r\n6. Check if the error message doesn't appear\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nSince 1.2.0 an anonymous user is unable to see a public dashboard.\r\nThis is caused because:\r\n1. no roles are attached to an anonymous user\r\n2. on the [bootstrap_user_data](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/86a59a292725f70336e3fa7c1109fec15103fdad/superset/views/utils.py#L63) function, when the user is anonymous, the permissions fetching process is skipped.\r\n\r\nThis will lead to an empty user payload\r\n![empty_user_on_state](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23409890/122455632-85b8d080-cfa4-11eb-9a79-f1d0a8535f3e.png)\r\nleading to an Unexpected error on the dashboard page.\r\n\r\nMy changes: since an anonymous user doesn't have roles associated, on the bootstrap_user_data function, I associate the public role to it, which then on [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/86a59a292725f70336e3fa7c1109fec15103fdad/superset/views/utils.py#L77) line respective permissions can be fetched.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER\r\nBefore:\r\nScreenshots present on the three issues descriptions\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nDashboards are displayed without login\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add the permission mentioned in [this](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14912#issuecomment-876377800) comment to the public role OR set PUBLIC_ROLE_LIKE = \"Gamma\"\r\n2. Create a dashboard if don't have any\r\n3. Copy the URL for the dashboard \r\n4. Logout or enter an anonymous browser session\r\n5. Enter in the dashboard's URL\r\n6. Check if it renders properly with no Unexpected error.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd a method to the GSheets DB engine spec to validate parameters from the new DB modal. This is currently not used, since GSheets is not exposed to the new modal.\r\n\r\nThe validation takes a payload that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    parameters = {\r\n        \"catalog\": {\r\n            \"private_sheet\": \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1/edit\",\r\n            \"public_sheet\": \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1/edit#gid=1\",\r\n            \"not_a_sheet\": \"https://www.google.com/\",\r\n        },\r\n        \"credentials_info\": \"SECRET\",\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt checks each URL to see if it's accessible, using the credentials if present, and returns a SIP-40 error payload indicating any URLs not are not accessible.\r\n\r\nShoutout to @ofekisr for decoupling unit tests from integration tests! The tests I added are unit tests, though they still require an [app context](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/testing/#the-testing-skeleton). I created a small fixture to provide that, and added the `pytest-mock` plugin since it helps keeping tests cleaner.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nCurrently this method is a no-op, but I added unit tests and did manual integration test.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ pytest tests/unit_tests\r\n...\r\n3 passed, 19 warnings in 2.68s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n

SUMMARY\r\nA better best practice is to put all project dependencies into the requirements file instead of setup.py\r\nso adding a new dependency will Imply running pip-compile-multi.\r\nWhen adding a new dependency into setup.py, pip-comiple-multi verify will not detect the change. \r\nthis PR try to prevent issues like #15527 \r\n\r\nActually, I adapted the way pip-compile-multi did \r\nand you can take another reference here: [pip-compile-issue](https://github.com/peterdemin/pip-compile-multi/issues/273)\r\n\r\nanother Important issue this PR fix is the packages that were in setup.py weren't pinned versions so the client who installs superset is not guaranteed the superset's dependencies will be the same when code was merged \r\n\r\nnote - before the commit, after moving the packages from setup.py I ran `pip-compile-multi --no-upgrade` to ensure \r\nthat all requirements files are ok\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nBefore opening the pr, I ran tox to ensure superset init is running to prove superset was installed ( successful running the ci inside tox)\r\nyou can try run tox by yourself\r\nin addition, if the pr checks success, it mean nothing breaks \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

On the way fix Range filter that doesn't apply default value in next flow:\r\na. Create Select Filter\r\nb. Switch it's type to Range Filter\r\n\r\n4. Removes reset form functionality because of 2 reasons:\r\na. When form saved or closed now it destroys Ant form, so no need reset it\r\nb. It applies reset before form closed, and it can mess some form fields before it closed\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n- Separates the viz gallery code from the explore control/modal code\r\n- Tweaks to thumbnail layout: use grid to set space-between and remove strange tall thumbnail containers\r\n- Sort categories (alphabetically + \"Other\" at the end)\r\n- Instead of showing the modal on the Add Slice page, show the contents of the viz gallery directly (Explore still uses the modal)\r\n- Fixed a minor bug where after clicking the X, you'd be stuck in a category. The search box would still be focused and you could type in it but it wouldn't search.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nOn the Add Slice page\r\n<img width=\"1134\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 4 47 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/124205256-bb29e780-da95-11eb-93f1-9005a966eb85.png\">\r\n\r\nThe viz type control in Explore\r\n<img width=\"1133\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-01 at 4 48 11 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/124201157-22429e80-da8c-11eb-9651-75117d2b60bf.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Go to Add Slice\r\n2. Go to Explore and change the slice\r\n3. Search, hit the X, and type again\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nHistorically we've seen records in our database where the Dashboard JSON metadata had `\"show_native_filters\": true` even though we never enabled the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature. This was problematic as both native and legacy filters were then present resulting in incorrect behavior when filters were cleared.\r\n\r\nIt seemed prudent that the default adheres to the feature flag setting rather than being set to `true`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n###
