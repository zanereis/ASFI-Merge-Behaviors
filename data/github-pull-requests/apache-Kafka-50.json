the references to `MockStreamsMetrics` since it actually was not a mock, instead used Mockito to mock the implementations.

However, `MockStreamsMetrics` is removed from the majority of the unit tests where it is referenced.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

Motivation\r\nFirstly, let me post the exception log of the client running:\r\n\r\n_\"org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.CommitFailedException: Commit cannot be completed since the group has already rebalanced and assigned the partitions to another member. This means that the time between subsequent calls to poll() was longer than the configured max.poll.interval.ms, which typically implies that the poll loop is spending too much time message processing. You can address this either by increasing max.poll.interval.ms or by reducing the maximum size of batches returned in poll() with max.poll.records.\"_\r\n\r\nThis is the client exception log provided to us by the online business. First, we confirmed that there is no issue on the server brokers. Then according to the exception prompt information, it may be judged that the settings of \"max.poll.interval.ms\" and \"max.poll.records\" may be unreasonable, but the actual processing time of business printing is much shorter than \"max.poll.interval.ms\", so We're sure that's not the reason. In the end, it was found that there is such a case: the business uses a \"group id\" to subscribe to some partitions of \"topic1\" through the simple consumer mode, and set \"auto.offset.reset=false\". When using the same \"group id\" name to start a high level consumer on \"topic2\", the original service using simple consumer throws CommitFailedException. And I have reproduced this process.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nIn fact, this is not a bug, but a problem with the way the client is used, but I think the exception message of `CommitFailedException` may have imperfect and  misleading guidance, so I have enriched the message that there may be special situations.","created_at":"2023-06-29T09:40:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T06:44:28Z","closed_at":"2024-04-18T06:44:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbd2402ee4476dba659236cc30f802243e46dc70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c546bc77c4e132272554c6b2d83af89f9b7669e3","head":{"label":"hudeqi:fix_commitException","ref":"fix_commitException","sha":"c546bc77c4e132272554c6b2d83af89f9b7669e3","user":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271168921,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNjg5MjE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"hudeqi/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi/kafka","description":"Mirror

JVM based KafkaConsumer contains a check that rejects nested invocations from different threads (in method acquire). For programs that use an async runtime, this is an almost impossible requirement. Also, the check is more strict than is required; we only need to validate that there is no concurrent access to the consumer.\r\n\r\nExamples of affected async runtimes are Kotlin co-routines (KAFKA-7143) and Zio.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we replace the thread-id check with an access-key that allows a callback to pass on its capability to access the Kafka consumer to another thread.\r\n\r\nTo keep existing programs working without changes, the access key is stored on a thread-local variable. Developers that work in an async runtime can get the access-key via `getThreadAccessKey` and then activate it on the thread-local variable in a thread of their choosing with `setThreadAccessKey`.\r\n\r\nKafka consumer methods that need to be protected against multi-threaded access start with invoking private method `acquire` and end with invoking private method `release`. This commit changes the implementation of `acquire` and `release`.\r\n\r\nFor programs that are unaware of the access-key, the semantics remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves KAFKA-14972 and KAFKA-7143.\r\n\r\nSee also KIP-944 https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/chw0Dw for more information.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

Activation\r\nIn the “syncTopicAcls” thread of MirrorSourceConnector, full amount of \"TopicAclBindings\" related to the replicated topics of the source cluster will be regularly listed, and then fully updated to the target cluster. Therefore, a large number of repeated \"TopicAclBindings\" will be repeatedly sent  by calling \"targetAdminClient\". This action is redundant. In addition, if too many \"TopicAclBindings\" are updated at one time, it may also take a long time for the target cluster to handle processing the \"createAcls\" request, which will affect the accumulation of the request queue of the target cluster and further affect the processing delay of other type requests.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\"TopicAclBinding\" can be like the variable

follow-up to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13804. This follow-up adds the alternative fix approach mentioned in the PR above - bumping the session timeout used in the test with 1 second.\r\n\r\nReproducing the flake-out locally has been much harder than on the CI runs, as neither Gradle with Java 11 or Java 14 nor IntelliJ with Java 14 could show it, but IntelliJ with Java 11 could occasionally reproduce the failure the first time immediately after a rebuild. While I was unable to see the failure with the bumped session timeout, the testing procedure definitely didn't provide sufficient reassurance for the fix as even without it often I'd see hundreds of consecutive successful test runs when the first run didn't fail.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

PR will fix the bug reported on [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/KAFKA/issues/KAFKA-13988). There was a previous PR submitted for this but there wasn't any movement on it for an year, so filing a new one. \r\n\r\n**Testing Instructions**\r\n\r\n**Manual testing**\r\n\r\n1.  Produce 'n' messages to topic 'T1' on source cluster.\r\n2.  Setup MM2 replication with config \"consumer.auto.offset.reset\": \"latest\" to replicate from topic 'T1'\r\n3.  Produce 'n+y' messages to topic 'T1' on source cluster.\r\n4.  Consume from 'TargetCluster' from replicated topic: 'SourceCluster.T1'\r\n5.  The consumed messages should only contain latest 'y' messages but not the old ones. ✅\r\n6.  Produce 'n' messages to topic 'T2' on source cluster.\r\n7.  Setup MM2 replication with config \"consumer.auto.offset.reset\": \"earliest\" to replicate from topic 'T2'\r\n8.  Produce 'n+y' messages to topic 'T2' on source cluster.\r\n9.  Consume from 'TargetCluster' from replicated topic: 'SourceCluster.T2'\r\n10. The consumed messages should contain all the 'n+y' messages. ✅\r\n\r\n**Unit Tests**\r\n\r\nWrote a unit-test to test this behavior successfully.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

At this time, when I start the kafka process under the local bin dir, I will encounter the problem that it cannot be started because the version is running incorrectly.\r\nThe reason is that /kafka-run-class.sh transfers all jar packages to CLASSPATH by default, which is an unreasonable behavior.\r\nThe issue scene is in [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15110)\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nSelect the package to run the current code version in kafka-run-class.sh. \r\nAfter testing, this problem was solved very well. Need to see if this change will affect CI test.","created_at":"2023-06-21T09:56:40Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T02:38:14Z","closed_at":"2023-11-02T02:38:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c44e9d726569c89dc7e9054dad5125713626934a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/063abf6365674528646687fdc323a46cb655f7c3","head":{"label":"hudeqi:hdq_fix_run","ref":"hdq_fix_run","sha":"063abf6365674528646687fdc323a46cb655f7c3","user":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271168921,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNjg5MjE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"hudeqi/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi/kafka","description":"Mirror

on top of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13812, this PR aims to implement the existing JoinGroup protocol within the new group coordinator. \r\n\r\nFor reviewing, one can start with `GroupMetadataManager#genericGroupJoin()`.\r\n\r\nSome notable differences:\r\n* methods return a CoordinatorResult to the runtime framework, which includes records to append to the log as well as a future to complete after the append succeeds/fails.\r\n*  The coordinator runtime ensures that only a single thread will be processing a group at any given time, therefore there is no more locking on groups.\r\n* Instead of using on purgatories, we rely on the Timer interface to schedule/cancel delayed operations.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-16T22:00:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T07:15:13Z","closed_at":"2023-07-19T07:15:13Z","merged_at":"2023-07-19T07:15:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"a500c3ecf9a5926681eacc778f44076dc699d853","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

threads=kafka.server.ReplicaManagerTest:ReplicaFetcherThread-0-1 ==> expected: <0> but was: <1>\r\n\tat

tests, I would recommend to use the \"Hide Whitespaces\" option of GitHub while looking at the review.","created_at":"2023-06-16T17:28:06Z","updated_at":"2023-06-21T07:55:09Z","closed_at":"2023-06-21T07:55:03Z","merged_at":"2023-06-21T07:55:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd25753aa2d7d54180d46c977f46d0ed20ca3feb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

Java rewrite is kept relatively close to the Scala original to minimize potential newly introduced bugs and to make reviewing simpler. The following details might be of note:\r\n- The `Logging` trait moved to `InterBrokerSendThread` with the rewrite of `ShutdownableThread` has been similarly moved to any subclasses that currently use it. `InterBrokerSendThread`'s own logging has been made to use `ShutdownableThread`'s logger which mimics the prefix/log identifier that the trait provided.\r\n- The case `RequestAndCompletionHandler` class has been made a separate POJO class and the internal-use `UnsentRequests` class has been kept as a static nested class.\r\n- The relatively commonly used but internal (not part of the public API) clients classes that `InterBrokerSendThread` relies on have been allowlisted in the server-common import control.\r\n- The accompanying test class has also been moved and rewritten with one new test added and most of the pre-existing tests made stricter.\r\n- The main abstract method of `InterBrokerSendThread` - `generateRequests()` - now returns a Java collection so `asScala` has been used at the various call-sites in Scala classes.\r\n\r\nThe local test run after the changes ended with _7661 tests completed, 2 failed, 3 skipped_ and the failures being seemingly unrelated and not in server-common or core.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-14T22:05:36Z","updated_at":"2023-06-20T14:50:47Z","closed_at":"2023-06-20T14:50:46Z","merged_at":"2023-06-20T14:50:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"b100f1efac77bf795683ab5e68ecf87845372089","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/827af58c579c5c3fff1e32a5a4a6eec3c57c8338","head":{"label":"dimitarndimitrov:kafka-15087","ref":"kafka-15087","sha":"827af58c579c5c3fff1e32a5a4a6eec3c57c8338","user":{"login":"dimitarndimitrov","id":30328539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzI4NTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30328539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitarndimitrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":616989779,"node_id":"R_kgDOJMaEUw","name":"kafka","full_name":"dimitarndimitrov/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dimitarndimitrov","id":30328539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzI4NTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30328539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitarndimitrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dimitarndimitrov/kafka","description":"Mirror

in the AbstractHerder class, the behavior of state changes for Connectors and Tasks is handled by implementing Listener using the ConnectorStatus and TaskStatus classes, which inherit from AbstractStatus. However, the code implementing the state change behavior in ConnectorStatus refers to and uses an inappropriate State enum class.\r\n\r\nBoth ConnectorStatus and TaskStatus inherit and implement AbstractStatus, and as a result, they share the State class. However, there is a need to make modifications for clear referencing. We need to fix the implementation in ConnectorStatus to use the appropriate reference for state changes.\r\n\r\nThis bug ticket will address the task of modifying the code to use the correct reference

Activation\r\nAs the config 'segment.bytes' for topics related MM2(such as offset.storage.topic, config.storage.topic,status.storage.topic), if following the default configuration of the broker or set it larger, then when the MM cluster runs many and complicated tasks, especially the log volume of the topic 'offset.storage.topic' is very large, it will affect the restart speed of the MM workers.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, the reason is that a consumer needs to be started to read the data of ‘offset.storage.topic’ at startup. Although this topic is set to compact, if the 'segment size' is set to a large value, such as the default value of 1G, then this topic may have tens of gigabytes of data that cannot be compacted and has to be read from the earliest (because the active segment cannot be cleaned), which will consume a lot of time (in our online environment, we found that this topic stores 13G of data, it took nearly half an hour for all the data to be consumed), which caused the worker to be unable to start and execute tasks for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe detail issue and log scene is [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15086)\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe number of consumer threads can also be adjusted, but I think it may be easier to set a upper limit for the 'segment size', for example, refer to the default value of __consumer_offsets:

Problem\r\nRemoteIndexCache cache is accessed from multiple threads concurrently in the fetch from consumer code path [1]. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the RemoteIndexCache uses LinkedHashMap as the cache implementation internally. Since LinkedHashMap is not a thread safe data structure, we use coarse grained lock on the entire map/cache when writing to the cache.\r\n\r\nThis means that if a thread if fetching information from a particular segment from RemoteStorageManager, other threads who are trying to access a different segment from the cache will also wait for the former thread to complete. This is due to the usage of global lock in the cache.\r\n\r\nThis lock contentions leads to decrease in throughput for fetch from consumer for cases where RSM network call may take more time.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nWe need a data structure for the cache which satisfies the following requirements:\r\n1. Multiple threads should be able to read concurrently.\r\n2. Fetch for missing keys should not block read for available keys.\r\n3. Only one thread should fetch for a specific key.\r\n4. Should support LRU policy.\r\n\r\nIn Java, all non concurrent data structures (such as LinkedHashMap) violate condition 2. We can potentially use Concurrent data structures such as ConcurrentHashMap but we will have to implement the LRU eviction ourselves on top of this. OR we can implement a LRU cache from scratch ourselves which satisfy the above constraints.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, (approach taken in this PR), we can use [Caffeine cache](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) which satisfies all the requirements mentioned above. Caffeine performs better than Google Guava cache [2] and is used by major open source projects such as Cassandra, HBase etc. Hence, it is safe to consider this a stable dependency.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- This PR uses Caffeine as the underlying cache for RemoteIndexCache. \r\n- Old `File` API has been replaces with `Files` API introduced since JDK 7.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- A test has been added which verifies requirement 2 above. The test fails prior to the change and is successful after it.\r\n- New tests have been added to improve overall test coverage.\r\n\r\n[1]
