What is this PR for?\r\nWhen you paste text on Windows, you may inadvertedly add some Carriage Return control characters along with it. When this happens in a Livy paragraph in Zeppelin 0.6.0, execution of that paragraph will fail with a \"500 Internal Server Error\" message. This is because `LivyHelper` does not properly sanitise its input when generating a JSON payload for the Livy server. This PR takes the subset for the resolution of [ZEPPELIN-1430](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1430/) that should resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1729>\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nPaste the following code in a new paragraph, ensuring that lines are ended by CRLF rather than LF:\r\n\r\n    %livy.pyspark\r\n    import datetime\r\n    import json\r\n\r\nThis can be easily realised on Windows, by copy-pasting this code from Notepad. Then, try to execute the paragraph. Without the fix, a \"500 Internal Server Error\" message should appear. With the fix, the paragraph will successfully execute (and do nothing interesting).\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No.\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No.","created_at":"2016-11-29T23:25:35Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T00:33:52Z","closed_at":"2016-12-01T21:59:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b823ca3651c6a3ecc1d49fdf8819429df2c9f4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/3adb646bcdb6959000978f25d6ca5848448433cd","head":{"label":null,"ref":"ZEPPELIN-1729","sha":"3adb646bcdb6959000978f25d6ca5848448433cd","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-0.6","ref":"branch-0.6","sha":"7bf8cc0c210d83388a083e4cb5f0708d00bbb70f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

Don't activate shiro authentication\r\n2. Open any notes \r\n3. Click lock icon in the top of the note -> warning dialog will be shown \\w \"Only authenticated user can set the permission.\" sentence\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n - Doesn't show note permission setting page & show warning dialog if anonymous user tries to click lock icon\r\n![block](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/21317259/be509bfa-c647-11e6-960e-2f98be4ce09f.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n*

IDEA)\r\n\r\nBy fixing those issues, we can keep our code clean. It will results the number of rebase count (reduced conflict due to just style) and boost our productivity.\r\n\r\n**important note**\r\n\r\n1. This PR set an option to print all checkstyle warnings into stdout. The reason is, people should be told about invalid styles of not only errors but also warnings.\r\n2. They would fix it progressionally. (unfortunately, we can fix all warnings in this PR. too much)\r\n3. Once those warnings are all fixed, we can set `<violationSeverity>warning</violationSeverity>` to fail build even when checkstyle warning is occurred. That means we have more strict rule for our java code :)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n            <consoleOutput>true</consoleOutput>\r\n            <!-- TODO: <violationSeverity>warning</violationSeverity>

this be tested?\r\nYou need to have a valid [Zeppelinhub account](https://www.zeppelinhub.com/register).\r\nYou need to enable zeppelinhub notebook repo (only) in zeppelin-env.sh\r\n```\r\nexport ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE=\"org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.zeppelinhub.ZeppelinHubRepo\"\r\nexport ZEPPELINHUB_API_ADDRESS=\"https://www.zeppelinhub.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Enable shiro](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/security/shiroauthentication.html#1-enable-shiro) and set it to use [Zeppelinhub realm](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/security/shiroauthentication.html#zeppelinhub).\r\n\r\nStart zeppelin, login, you will see your list of notebooks, if you want to switch instance, go to NotebookRepos, and edit.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![zeppelinhub_note_repo_instance_switch](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3139557/20626992/8b518628-b360-11e6-9c73-c5af793a93c5.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n**First of all, this PR doesn't affect on runtime application behaivor and existing build processes. Just abstracting variables in pom.xml**\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this PR is bringing consistency and maintainability in all pom.xml.  I referred these 2 projects.\r\n\r\n- [apache/spark: pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/pom.xml)\r\n- [apache/storm: pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/pom.xml)\r\n\r\nCurrently, all libraries and plugins have duplicated version fields since we are not using `dependencyManagement`, `pluginManagement` efficiently in pom.xml\r\n\r\nThis results in \r\n\r\n- unmanaged plugin, library versions (someone might update only a child's library version. it happend in our pom.xml files)\r\n- so many duplicated code blocks (bad)\r\n- fragmented plugin, library versions (some project uses junit 4.11 while another uses 4.12)\r\n\r\nThese are some examples\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n// hard

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\n**First of all, this PR doesn't affect on runtime application behaivor and existing build processes. Just adding validation and styling**\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this PR is to keep consistency among multiple pom.xml files\r\n\r\n- added xml-maven-plugin to enforce valid maven conf and xml code style (included in maven verify phase)\r\n- while removing 2 invalid `combine.children` conf (they are invalid, useless. see commit messages)\r\n- apply 2 space indent according to [maven style guide](https://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html)\r\n\r\nFor reviewers, \r\n\r\nmost code modification is due to 4064057 (re-indent commit), **so skipping the commit will be helpful to review this**.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n* [x] - Add maven xml plugin\r\n* [x] - Reindent according to maven style guide\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1695)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nCI will do that. Also you can type `mvn xml:validate` usually it takes 10+- seconds.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Zeppelin ...........................................

What is this PR for?\r\n* Instead of creating fat jar for zeppelin-interpreter and add it to classpath, place zeppelin-interpreter.jar and dependencies under `lib/interpreter` directory and add this dir to classpath of zeppelin-server and interpreter. (removed maven-shade-plugin)\r\n* Exclude some transitive dependencies from `zeppelin-zengine` which cause conflicts with those of `zeppelin-interpreter`\r\n* Exclude configuration files(`credential.json`, `notebook-authorization.json`, `shiro.ini`) when create binary package.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1605](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1605)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Check if `interpreter` directory has created under `zeppelin-distribution/target/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/`\r\n2. Test `md` interpreter works as expected after running below command:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pbuild-distr\r\n$ cd zeppelin-distribution/target/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n$ ./bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh start\r\n```\r\n3. Check if md intepreter process has `zeppelin-distribution/target/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/zeppelin-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/lib/interpreter/*` in it's classpath.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-21T00:22:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T04:49:01Z","closed_at":"2016-12-11T05:44:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cbddd9ee57319855a5faef185d5d9f6426ce9c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/984195896e304f8cb5d34172fc054e7137828c9e","head":{"label":"minahlee:ZEPPELIN-1605","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1605","sha":"984195896e304f8cb5d34172fc054e7137828c9e","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33116265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzExNjI2NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"minahlee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nRecently, zeppelin added some amazing features. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1613 \r\nYou can easily access spark ui from the zeppelin web.\r\nHowever, in the implementation of the function, the Thrift interface seems to have arbitrarily modified the automatically generated code.\r\nSo if you recreate the Thift interface by calling genthrift.sh.\r\nZeppelin is not built.\r\nI modified this to get the same result with auto-generated code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n- [x] add event

tested?\r\n1. First you need to install thift 0.9.2.\r\n2. Run zeppelin-interpreter / src / main / thrift / generate_thrift.sh.\r\n3. Build full zeppelin.\r\n4. After build, please check the interpreter spark setting in our web ui.\r\n5. Try using the spark ui button.\r\n\r\nIf everything is running normally, it is a success.\r\nProblems occur in the current master 3.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently when you're trying to search some interpreters, for example \"Spark\", the page shows both \"Livy\" and \"Spark\". It's because Livy contains Spark related properties such as `livy.spark.driver.cores`, `livy.spark.driver.memory` and etc etc. As an user aspect, I felt a bit uncomfortable with this.\r\nSo I added one more condition so that it can search only based on interpreter name. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nno Jira issue for this\r\n\r\n### How

What is this PR for?\r\nTake 2 of #1618 because I had some earlier problems with rebasing. Since, then I have added some new features, namely:\r\n\r\n- Matplotlib integration tests for pyspark\r\n- `install_external_dependencies.sh` which conditionally installs the R or python dependencies based on the specified build profile in `.travis.yml`. This saves several minutes of time for a few of the build profiles since the R dependencies are compiled from source and therefore take quite a bit of time to install.\r\n- The extra python unit tests which require external dependencies (`matplotlib` and `pandas`) are now relegated to two separate build profiles. This is done primarily to efficiently test both Python 2 and 3.\r\n- Some minor bugs in the python and pyspark interpreters (mostly with respect to python 3 compatibility) were caught as a result of these tests, and are also fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement and Bugfix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1639)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCI tests should be green!\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nIn multi-user environment when users create a notebook normally they would expect that notebook be listed only in their list/workbench. Currently Zeppelin creates/imports notes as public by default. There should be at least a way to pass through configuration to make this behaviour private be default. Should discuss whether it's public or private by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - set permissions on create/import\r\n* [x] - test\r\n* [x] - review, feedback, decide whether public/private by default\r\n* [x] - pass through env. config\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1657](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1657)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. set `zeppelin.notebook.public` property as false in `zeppelin-site.xml`\r\n2. login as user1 and create noteA, note should appear in your list of notes\r\n3. logout and login as user2, shouldn't be able to see noteA\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nSo far roles have been accessible only from SecurityUtils for Rest api or from websocket message field. However sometimes it's required to access roles in websocket server even without receiving message, say for broadcasting note list per user. More details in issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix | Improvement \r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - add roles in NotebookAuthorization\r\n* [x] - assign roles on login\r\n* [x] - use roles on broadcast \r\n* [x] - test\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1647](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1647)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nlogin as user1, and user2 at same time and each user should have own workbench (based on notebook permissions)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-09T15:11:57Z","updated_at":"2016-11-17T04:46:45Z","closed_at":"2016-11-14T19:05:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19782d0abfd4b28dc5440cc117e658ec2e2b815c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/490c4d0e107f1e1deacda9239b739b191446d5db","head":{"label":"khalidhuseynov:fix/apply-correct-roles-broadcast","ref":"fix/apply-correct-roles-broadcast","sha":"490c4d0e107f1e1deacda9239b739b191446d5db","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33517255,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzUxNzI1NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"khalidhuseynov/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nDoc should deliver key features and recommended usage more simple and easy way.\r\n\r\n - docs/install/install.md has lots of duplicated section with README.md.\r\n - docs/install/install.md includes install from binary as well as build from source. I've seen that makes some beginners try download binary and then source build it again.\r\n - recommended and key usage need to be highlighted.\r\n - Be less verbose in key instructions. Move optional, additional info from in the middle of key instruction to end of the each page.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - improve doc\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1644\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nRun doc locally\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nZEPPELIN-1472 - Create new LdapRealm based on Apache Knox LdapRealm: Provides LdapRealm Functionality similar to what Apache Knox provides. This is critical as in large enterprise environments Active Directory Global Catalogs are used for lookup with samAccountName and using a DN Template is not an option as their are multiple OUs. Also searching on \"userPrincipalName\" is risky in an AD environment since the explicit UPN vs Implicit UPN can be different this is definitely the case with environments using Office 365. And the LDAP userPrincipalName attribute is the explicit UPN which can be defined by the directory administrator to any value and it can be duplicated. SamAccountName is unique per domain and Microsoft states best practice is to not allow duplicate samAccountName's across the forest. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the above changes I have adjusted and moved the LdapGroupRealm and ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm into the org.apache.zeppelin.realm package structure to make all Realm's consistent. \r\n\r\nThe LdapRealm class also works with role to group mapping for usage within Zeppelin for notebook authorization.\r\n\r\nI have adjusted SecurityUtils to use ClassName vs realmName in determining what to use as you may have companies that decide to use their own custom realmname in shiro.ini and may not realize you cannot so using className is much safer. \r\n\r\n\r\nExample - SecurityUtils\r\n        String name = realm.getClass().getName();\r\n        if (name.equals(\"org.apache.shiro.realm.text.IniRealm\")) {\r\n          allRoles = ((IniRealm) realm).getIni().get(\"roles\");\r\n          break;\r\n        } else if (name.equals(\"org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm\")) {\r\n          allRoles = ((LdapRealm) realm).getListRoles();\r\n          break;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nExample - SecurityRestApi:\r\n          String name = realm.getClass().getName();\r\n          if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\r\n            LOG.debug(\"RealmClass.getName: \" + name);\r\n          }\r\n          if (name.equals(\"org.apache.shiro.realm.text.IniRealm\")) {\r\n            usersList.addAll(getUserListObj.getUserList((IniRealm) realm));\r\n            rolesList.addAll(getUserListObj.getRolesList((IniRealm) realm));\r\n          } else if (name.equals(\"org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapGroupRealm\")) {\r\n            usersList.addAll(getUserListObj.getUserList((JndiLdapRealm) realm, searchText));\r\n          } else if (name.equals(\"org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm\")) {\r\n            usersList.addAll(getUserListObj.getUserList((LdapRealm) realm, searchText));\r\n            rolesList.addAll(getUserListObj.getRolesList((LdapRealm) realm));\r\n          } else if (name.equals(\"org.apache.zeppelin.realm.ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm\")) {\r\n            usersList.addAll(getUserListObj.getUserList((ActiveDirectoryGroupRealm) realm,\r\n                searchText));\r\n          } else if (name.equals(\"org.apache.shiro.realm.jdbc.JdbcRealm\")) {\r\n            usersList.addAll(getUserListObj.getUserList((JdbcRealm) realm));\r\n
