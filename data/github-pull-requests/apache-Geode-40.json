of DataSerializableFixedID has been extracted from InternalDataSerializer and moved to a new geode-serialization subproject.\r\n\r\nDataSerializableFixedID toData/fromData methods are enhanced to have a SerializationContext parameter that they can use to get serializer instances and the Version of the data stream they're working on.  Most of the changes in this PR are associated with this enhancement.  There are two serializers in the context - a DSFIDSerializer and a serializer plugin that is provided by Geode's InternalDataSerializer.  The latter is able to serialize/deserialize other kinds of serializables like PDX and DataSerializable.\r\n\r\nInternalDataSerializer initializes a DSFIDSerializer and registers all of the Geode DSFID serializable classes with that serializer, allowing it to serialize/deserialize instances of these classes.\r\n\r\nVersion.java has been moved to the new subproject and put in a new package.  Consequently backward-compatibility test code can no longer refer to this class and needs to get version information from the test framework's VersionManager.  All current tests have been modified to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

upgrade and similar tests that run test code in JVMs using older versions of Geode fail when changing logging classes because these tests are using org.apache.geode.test.dunit.LogWriterUtils.getLogWriter(). This PR creates a fully inlined version of LogWriterLogger in geode-dunit for use by LogWriterUtils. This is all deprecated and should be removed eventually. The removal of LogWriterUtils will keep a developer busy for a while removing the calls from many tests. This geode-dunit LogWriterLogger is temporary and unfortunate but ultimately necessary if we want to move log4j-core code to geode-log4j.\r\n\r\n@aaronlindsey please

fix is to handle a very specific race condition scenario as described here:\r\n\r\nSubscription HA is enabled and a server is providing a client queue image to a peer (serializing the queue). Meanwhile, a client is also just finished client subscription registration with that same server and is recalculating its filter info to determine if the client needs the event.

fix is to handle a very specific race condition scenario as described here:\r\n\r\nSubscription HA is enabled and a server is providing a client queue image to a peer (serializing the queue). Meanwhile, a client is also just finished client subscription registration with that same server and is recalculating its filter info to determine if the client needs the event. Recalculating the filter info results in the client message in the HAContainer to be mutated, which causes a ConcurrentModificationException to occur in the GII provider thread. The fix we landed on is to make a copy of the client update message when recalculating the filter info in the drain logic from the client registration queue. This guarantees that there will be no shared state between the GII thread and the client registration thread, and it also covers the case that multiple clients are calculating the filter info on the same event and potentially in contention.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ryan McMahon <rmcmahon@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Donal Evans <doevans@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

fix is to handle a very specific race condition scenario as described here:\r\n\r\nSubscription HA is enabled and a server is providing a client queue image to a peer (serializing the queue). Meanwhile, a client is also just finished client subscription registration with that same server and is recalculating its filter info to determine if the client needs the event.  Recalculating the filter info results in the client message in the HAContainer to be mutated, which causes a ConcurrentModificationException to occur in the GII provider thread.  The fix we landed on is to make a copy of the client update message when recalculating the filter info in the drain logic from the client registration queue.  This guarantees that there will be no shared state between the GII thread and the client registration thread, and it also covers the case that multiple clients are calculating the filter info on the same event and potentially in contention.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

passing a \"final check\" a member will be subject to suspect\r\nprocessing again but we weren't processing the suspect message locally.\r\nThis caused JoinLeave to never be notified of the suspect so that\r\nremoval could be initiated.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that a method in HealthMonitor was misnamed.  It claimed\r\nto return the set of members that had failed availability checks but\r\ninstead it was returning a set of members currently under suspicion.  Looking\r\nat the uses of this method I think it could cause members to be kicked out\r\nthat were only late in sending heartbeats.  They should go through full availability\r\nchecks before being kicked out.  The new code ensures that this happens\r\nand that RemoveMemberMessages will be processed locally after performing those\r\nchecks.\r\n\r\n@Bill \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the timeout to 30 minutes but also changes the CALL_STACK_TIMEOUT to be 1200 seconds (20 minutes).  The latter configuration parameter controls when we declare the task \"hung\" and dump stacks.  We were not dumping stacks at all before these changes because the value was 1800 seconds which is well above the timeout of 10 minutes.  With my proposed change we will dump stacks before the task times out so we will have something to look at in the test artifacts to identify the hang.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
