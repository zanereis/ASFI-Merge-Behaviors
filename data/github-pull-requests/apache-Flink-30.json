you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMigrate  executiongraph related tests under flink-runtime module to junit5\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMigrate  executiongraph related tests under flink-runtime module to junit5\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no \r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd a config to allow disabling QUERY hints - https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.17/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/hints/#query-hints\r\nConfig name: `table.optimizer.ignore-query-hints`\r\nDefault value: false\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- The query hints config is not ignored by default\r\n- If enabled/ignored, a ValidationException is thrown. This behavior is consistent when a user disables OPTIONS hint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for all kinds of Query Hints to verify a ValidationException is thrown when Query hints are disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPrevent ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector from identifying tasks in CREATED state as slow tasks.\r\n## Brief change log\r\nPrevent ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetector from identifying tasks in CREATED state as slow tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by ExecutionTimeBasedSlowTaskDetectorTest#testNoScheduledTask\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32871\r\nas issue report，we need TO_TIMESTAMP function with timezone to choose like ： TO_TIMESTAMP('2023-08-10', 'yyyy-MM-dd', 'Asia/Shanghai')\r\n\r\nas presto,trino,starrocks:\r\nSELECT timestamp '2012-10-31 01:00 UTC' AT TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles';\r\n2012-10-30 18:00:00.000 America/Los_Angeles\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T11:27:32Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:10:15Z","closed_at":"2023-10-12T09:46:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfd1956d2c48440ba724a3ad8c97f678d4f26b0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4a6efba11f072edea167bda533e574ff772b9e83","head":{"label":"xuzifu666:totimestamp_timezone","ref":"totimestamp_timezone","sha":"4a6efba11f072edea167bda533e574ff772b9e83","user":{"login":"xuzifu666","id":10645422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ1NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10645422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666","html_url":"https://github.com/xuzifu666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":394358546,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQzNTg1NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xuzifu666/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuzifu666","id":10645422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjQ1NDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10645422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666","html_url":"https://github.com/xuzifu666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuzifu666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuzifu666/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request support specifying the HDFS path when ship archives or files.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Support specifying the hdfs path when ship archives or files*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test that add HDFS file by parameter `yarn.ship-files`*\r\n  - *Added test that add HDFS archive file by parameter `yarn.ship-archives`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T10:32:10Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:10:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-30T14:52:20Z","merged_at":"2023-08-30T14:52:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c50b4e956305426f478b726d4de4a640a16b810","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a4a27302a24c22403eb967f18b944a3b10a00e3d","head":{"label":"qinf:FLINK-20681","ref":"FLINK-20681","sha":"a4a27302a24c22403eb967f18b944a3b10a00e3d","user":{"login":"qinf","id":1277293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzcyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf","html_url":"https://github.com/qinf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676507564,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFKvrA","name":"flink","full_name":"qinf/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qinf","id":1277293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzcyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf","html_url":"https://github.com/qinf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qinf/flink","description":"Apache

Migration] The state package of flink-runtime module\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] The state package of flink-runtime module\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] The state package of flink-runtime module\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-15T10:06:54Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:10:17Z","closed_at":"2023-09-11T14:58:51Z","merged_at":"2023-09-11T14:58:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"554810abbbd44a656a446d051b3dd199b0df9055","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cbe5f87cbb230f4a31e595bbca3f46c407ced04b","head":{"label":"Jiabao-Sun:FLINK-32854","ref":"FLINK-32854","sha":"cbe5f87cbb230f4a31e595bbca3f46c407ced04b","user":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362033666,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjIwMzM2NjY=","name":"flink","full_name":"Jiabao-Sun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently, runtime filter program will try to look for an Exchange as build side to avoid affecting MultiInput. It will try to push down the runtime filter builder if the original build side is not Exchange.\r\n\r\nCurrenlty, the builder-push-down does not aware the join type, which may lead to incorrect results(For example, push down the builder to the right input of left-join).\r\n\r\nWe should only support following cases:\r\n\r\n1. Inner join: builder can push to left + right input\r\n2. semi join: builder can push to left + right input\r\n3. left join: builder can only push to the left input\r\n4. right join: builder can only push to the right input\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd test `testBuildSideIsLeftJoinWithoutExchange`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**no**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**no**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**no**)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**no**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue that 4 out of 7 (MatrixVectorMul & Iteration & SessionWindowing & TopSpeedWindowing) Flink streaming examples cannot run because datagen connector is not packaged into the jars.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nPackage datagen connector into the self-contained example jars using Maven shade plugin.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Verified that these examples in a local standalone cluster.\r\n- Verified that the final jar does not contain any other classes besides connector-datagen and the target test classes.\r\n- Added integrated tests to verify if all examples can be submitted successfully and verified that the tests failed before the fix and succeeded after the fix.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMigrates JUnit4 unit tests in `org.apache.flink.runtime.accumulators` and `org.apache.flink.runtime.blob` packages to JUnit5.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Made test methods and classes package-private.\r\n  - Added `TestLoggerExtension` instead of extending JUnit4 `TestLogger` class.\r\n  - Migrated to `@TempDir` from the temp. folder class rule that does not exist in JUnit5.\r\n  - Added `BlobServer` and `BlobCache` instantiation utils to `TestingBlobUtils` to cut back code duplication.\r\n  - Moved some blob test helper utils that were used by the `HDFSTest` class from `flink-fs-tests` to a new public class `TestingBlobHelpers`, so all unit test classes can be package-private.\r\n  - Applied AssertJ for all assertion and assumption statements.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAny touched unit test should still run and verify the same thing as before.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix typo the class referenced by the logger*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFix typo the class referenced by the logger\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

Migration] Module: The taskexecutor package of flink-runtime\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] Module: The taskexecutor package of flink-runtime\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] Module: The taskexecutor package of flink-runtime\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, most of states of adaptive scheduler extends StateWithExecutionGraph, and it can reduce a lots of repeated code.\r\n\r\nWe can define the StateWithoutExecutionGraph and the corresponding Context as well, then the rest of states can extend the StateWithoutExecutionGraph, such as: Created, WaitingForResources, CreatingExecutionGraph.\r\n\r\nThis improvement can reduce a lot of code for these states, such as: cancel(), suspend(), getJob(), handleGlobalFailure() and getLogger().\r\n\r\nThese methods of Created, WaitingForResources and CreatingExecutionGraph are same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[FLINK-32859][scheduler] Introduce the StateWithoutExecutionGraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd min number of slots configuration to limit total number of slots\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce \"slotmanager.number-of-slots.min\" configuration option with default value 0\r\n- Introduce \"slotmanager.min-total-resource.cpu\" and \"slotmanager.min-total-resource.memory\" configuration option with default value derived from \"slotmanager.number-of-slots.min\"\r\n- Make DefaultResourceAllocationStrategy respect the min number of cpu and memory. DefaultResourceAllocationStrategy will alway check the min resource requirement when reconciling cluster resources or fulfilling resource requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added unit tests **SlotManagerConfigurationTest#testComputeMinTotalCpu**,  **SlotManagerConfigurationTest#testComputeMinTotalMemory**, **SlotManagerConfigurationTest#testComputeMinMaxSlotNumIsValid**, **SlotManagerConfigurationTest#testComputeMinMaxSlotNumIsInValid**, **SlotManagerConfigurationTest#testComputeMinMaxMemoryIsInValid**, **SlotManagerConfigurationTest#testComputeMinMaxCpuIsInValid** to test new added options\r\n  - Added unit tests **DefaultResourceAllocationStrategyTest#testMinRequiredCPULimitInTryReconcile**, **DefaultResourceAllocationStrategyTest#testMinRequiredMemoryLimitInTryReconcile**, **DefaultResourceAllocationStrategyTest#testMinRequiredCPULimitInTryFulfill** and **DefaultResourceAllocationStrategyTest#testMinRequiredMemoryLimitInTryFulfill**  to test the function in DefaultResourceAllocationStrategy\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) yes\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) yes, it will affect the behavior of SlotManager in  JobManager\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Migration] Module: The io package of flink-runtime\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] Module: The io package of flink-runtime\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] Module: The io package of flink-runtime\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMigrate flink-runtime/utils tests to JUnit5.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe change itself is for migrating UT.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nParameterTool and AbstractParameterTool in pacakge flink-java is mistakenly marked as deprecated in [FLINK-32558](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32558). They are widely used for handling application parameters and is also listed in the Flink user doc: [https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/datastream/application_parameters/.](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/datastream/application_parameters/). \r\n\r\nParameterTool is currently in the flink-java module, which is likely removed together with DataSet API in future. However, moving it to another module may introduce breaking changes to DataSet users, thus should only happen in the major version bump. Therefore, we'll revert the ParameterTool related changes for now.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRevert the ParameterTool related changes from FLINK-32558.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nStarted a local cluster and submitted Flink streaming examples, Iteration & SessionWindowing & TopSpeedWindowing still cannot run, but that's a separete issues to be solved in [FLINK-32821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32821).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-10T12:12:09Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:10:40Z","closed_at":"2023-08-13T03:12:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b23c092e046b9599101bb8cc2a7e075dec55fc94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273024685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI0Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataSet","name":"component=API/DataSet","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/399ee4b1fd9824a23b3b221a3d2cc5521cbdb61b","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-32820","ref":"FLINK-32820","sha":"399ee4b1fd9824a23b3b221a3d2cc5521cbdb61b","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

dose not work as expected\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Fixed YarnClusterDescriptor#isArchiveonlyincludedinShipArchiveFiles dose not work as expected*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test that validates that `YarnConfigOptions.SHIP_ARCHIVES` only support archive files *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-10T07:18:44Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:10:41Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T04:51:31Z","merged_at":"2023-08-11T04:51:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"ac85945947e11b2278c9fcdb24a6a6d695621ac4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23191/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23191/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23191/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b9c43dd74809fa36a29cd73490a8b86258f8b519","head":{"label":"qinf:FLINK-32809","ref":"FLINK-32809","sha":"b9c43dd74809fa36a29cd73490a8b86258f8b519","user":{"login":"qinf","id":1277293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzcyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf","html_url":"https://github.com/qinf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676507564,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFKvrA","name":"flink","full_name":"qinf/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qinf","id":1277293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzcyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf","html_url":"https://github.com/qinf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qinf/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis is an implementation of GENERATE_SERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nConstructs an array of values between start and end, inclusive.\r\nParameters start and end can be an INT or BIGINT.\r\nstep, if supplied, specifies the step size. The step can be positive or negative. If not supplied, step defaults to 1. Parameter step must be an INT.\r\n\r\n- Syntax\r\n```\r\nGENERATE_SERIES(start, end)\r\nGENERATE_SERIES(start, end, step)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Arguments\r\nstart: the beginning element of return array\r\nend: the ending element of return array\r\nstep: the size of step\r\n\r\n- Returns\r\nreturn an array of values between start and end, inclusive.\r\nif any input arguments equal to null, return null.\r\n\r\n- Examples\r\n```\r\nSELECT GENERATE_SERISE(1, 5);\r\nResult: [1,2,3,4,5]\r\n\r\nSELECT GENERATE_SERISE(0, 10, 2); \r\nResult: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10] \r\n```\r\n\r\n- See also\r\n\r\n1.PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL offers a function called generate_series which generates a set of contiguous integers from a start to an end value.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe hashcode function generates a hash code for a given input value, including support for computing hash values of binary data types. It creates a unique integer that represents the value passed to the function.

If the input argument is NULL, the function returns NULL.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nBecause it is an internal function now, so we cannot use select hashcode(value) to test it, so we use ArrayInterect function test case to test our hashcode function\r\nCollectionFunctionsITCase\r\n\r\n\r\n## see also:\r\nJava: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode--\r\n\r\nPython: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hash\r\n\r\nC#: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.gethashcode\r\n\r\nSQL Server: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/checksum-transact-sql\r\n\r\nMySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/encryption-functions.html#function_md5\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgcrypto-hash.html\r\n\r\nOracle: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ORA-HASH.html\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#farm_fingerprint\r\n\r\nAWS Redshift: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/MD5.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdds port range support for `taskmanager.data.bind-port`, which can be helpful in a restrictive network setup.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changed `taskmanager.data.bind-port` opion type from `Integer` to `String`.\r\n- Introduced `PortRange` utility to be able to carry the port range string and its generated iterator together.\r\n- Updated `NettyConfig` to handle a `PortRange` instead of a `port` as the port of the server.\r\n- Updated `NettyServer` to be able to initialize itself from a `PortRange`.\r\n- Adapted relevant code pieces and documentation.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added `NettyServerFromPortRangeTest` to test Netty server init from a port range.\r\n- Manually verified by setting `taskmanager.data.bind-port` to a port range (e.g. 55000-55100) while `taskmanager.data.port` is set to `0`, then TM should bind to the first available port from the given range both locally and externally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMaking the close procedure of `CollectSinkOperatorCoordinator` more explicit and added log messages.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Refactored the concurrent processing of requests to allow cancelling the case-specific logging\r\n* Use `shutdownNow` instead of `shutdown` to trigger the cancellation of any on-goring tasks\r\n\r\nI migrated `RestClientTest` as well because a first iteration of this PR required me to touch that test. I thought that it's still worth it to keep the migration commit.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Existing tests should still succeed\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis is an implementation of SPLIT\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nSplits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter. If the delimiter is not found, then the original string is returned as the only element in the array. If the delimiter is empty, then all characters in the string are split. If either, string or delimiter, are NULL, then a NULL value is returned.\r\nIf the delimiter is found at the beginning or end of the string, or there are contiguous delimiters, then an empty space is added to the array.\r\n\r\n- Syntax\r\n`SPLIT(string, delimiter)`\r\n\r\n- Arguments\r\nstring: The string need to be split\r\ndelimiter: Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter\r\n\r\n- Returns\r\nIf the delimiter is not found, then the original string is returned as the only element in the array. If the delimiter is empty, then all characters in the string are split. If either, string or delimiter, are NULL, then a NULL value is returned.\r\n\r\n- Examples\r\n```\r\nSELECT SPLIT('abcdefg', 'c');\r\nResult: ['ab', 'defg']\r\n```\r\n\r\n- See also\r\n1. ksqlDB Split function\r\nksqlDB provides a scalar function named SPLIT which splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.\r\nSyntax: SPLIT(string, delimiter)\r\nFor example: SPLIT('a,b,c', ',') will return ['a', 'b', 'c'].\r\nhttps://docs.ksqldb.io/en/0.8.1-ksqldb/developer-guide/ksqldb-reference/scalar-functions/#split\r\n\r\n2. Apache Hive Split function\r\nHive offers a function named split which splits a string around a specified delimiter and returns an array of strings.\r\nSyntax: array<string> split(string str, string pat)\r\nFor example: split('a,b,c', ',') will return [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF\r\n\r\n3. Spark SQL Split function\r\nSpark SQL also offers a function named split, similar to the one in Hive.\r\nSyntax: split(str, pattern[, limit])\r\nHere, limit is an optional parameter to specify the maximum length of the returned array.\r\nFor example: split('oneAtwoBthreeC', '[ABC]', 2) will return [\"one\", \"twoBthreeC\"].\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#split\r\n\r\n4. Presto Split function\r\nPresto offers a function named split which splits a string around a regular expression and returns an array of strings.\r\nSyntax: array<varchar> split(string str, string regex)\r\nFor example: split('a.b.c', '\\.') will return [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].\r\nhttps://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/string.html\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests in CollectionFunctionsITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:  \r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement the elt function to extract the n-th input value from a row of inputs.\r\nThe elt function in the ETL pipeline extracts the value at the n-th position from a input row. It is similar to array indexing, where the first element is at position 1. This function provides a convenient way to retrieve specific elements from a row of inputs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nELT for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n`ELT(row, n)`\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\nrow: input row, it can contain mixed type data.\r\nn: The index of the input value to extract. It should be a positive integer.\r\n\r\nReturns: Returns the element at the n-th position from a row of input values. If 'n' is less than 1 or greater than the number of inputs, or if any of the inputs is null, the function will return null.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSELECT ELT(('scala', 'java'), 2)\r\nOutput: 'java'\r\n\r\nSELECT ELT((2, 'a'), 1)\r\nOutput: 2  \r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also: \r\nspark:https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#elt\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe pull request solved HBaseRowDataLookupFunction HTable thread safety problem, the source code is open () method to initialize a in the class, because in the actual development process in the close basic won't execute () method, result in Ttable cannot be released, Subsequent programs use the same Ttable object, which has serious thread-safety issues. The current workaround is to place the Ttable initialization in the lookup () method and provide a close method for the Ttable to solve the thread-safe problem\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nplace the Ttable initialization in the lookup () method and provide a close method for the Ttable \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: ( no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: ( no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhotfix in AvroExternalJarprogram without unused testmethod\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport the handling of allocation errors when SpeculativeScheduler schedule speculative tasks by trigger fatal error.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSupport the handling of allocation errors when SpeculativeScheduler schedule speculative tasks by trigger fatal error.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by SpeculativeSchedulerTest#testNotifySlowTaskWithAllocateSlotException\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no)**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo fix thrift dependency conflict when ```flink-sql-connector-hive``` and ```flink-parquet``` both exist in the path.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nReshade dependencies that are already shaded in parquet. For naming I referred to [this](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/fa61dd439ece9e2b9ef710ce2f7eed54c4d4403a/flink-connectors/flink-connector-hive/pom.xml#L1270C10-L1270C10)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is about dependency without code change, so I believe it should be covered by existing tests\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes, shade dependency\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange ExecutionSlotAllocator#allocateSlotsFor return type to allow the order of execution and assignments to be inconsistent.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange ExecutionSlotAllocator#allocateSlotsFor return type to allow the order of execution and assignments to be inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no)**\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change aims to enhance the handling of classpath configuration when using the `yarn.provided.lib.dirs` property in a YARN environment. Currently, the `yarn.ship-files` property is used to add specific files to the classpath by including their parent directories. This is particularly useful for cases where resources like `hive-site.xml` need to be accessible to the application. In the specific context of this situation, an issue arises due to the fact that [HiveConf](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/common/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/conf/HiveConf.java#L197C19-L197C33) attempts to load `hive-site.xml` using `Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource(\"hive-site.xml\")`, which isn't feasible because the parent directory of hive-site.xml is not included within Flink's classpath.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change is to extend this approach to include the parent directory of files specified in `yarn.provided.lib.dirs` to the classpath and not the resources itself other than jar files. This will ensure that resources in these directories are available for the application's classpath enabling access to required configuration files.\r\n\r\nGist reference to show classpath before and after code change : [Link](https://gist.github.com/architgyl/e7dc901b86b019aa1513268e89d3e745)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdding parent directory of all the resources given in the `yarn.provided.lib.dirs`to the classpath and not adding resources itself except jar files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nVerified the change by adding hive-site.xml file full path to the classpath and was able to submit Flink job successfully and interact with Hive.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement the array_slice function to extract a subset of elements from an array.\r\n\r\nReturns a subarray of the input array between 'start_offset' and 'end_offset' inclusive. \r\nThe offsets are 1-based however 0 is also treated as the beginning of the array. \r\nPositive values are counted from the beginning of the array while negative from the end. \r\nIf 'end_offset' is omitted then this offset is treated as the length of the array. \r\nIf 'start_offset' is after 'end_offset' or both are out of array bounds an empty array will be returned. \r\nReturns null if any input is null.\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nARRAY_SLICE for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n\r\n`ARRAY_SLICE(array, start_offset[, end_offset])`\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\narray: The array that contains the elements you want to slice.\r\nstart_offset: The inclusive starting offset.\r\nend_offset: The inclusive ending offset, this is an optional argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns:  \r\nIf 'start_offset' is after 'end_offset' or both are out of array bounds an empty array will be returned. \r\nReturns null if any input is null.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SLICE(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], 1, 3)\r\nOutput: [a, b, c]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SLICE(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], -1, -3)\r\nOutput:

the elements' data type in the given array is string. The delimiter is a string that separates each pair of consecutive elements of the array. The optional nullReplacement is a string that replaces null elements in the array. If nullReplacement is not specified, null elements in the array will be omitted from the resulting string. Returns null if the input array and delimiter are null.\r\n \r\n- Syntax:\r\n`array_join(array, delimiter, [, null_replacement])`\r\n\r\n- Arguments:\r\narray: An ARRAY to be handled.\r\ndelimiter: A STRING used to separate the concatenated array elements.\r\nnull_replacement: A STRING used to express a NULL value in the result. It is a optional\r\n\r\n- Return:\r\nreturns a string that represents the concatenation of the elements in the given array and the elements' data type in the given array is string.\r\nReturns null if input array or delimiter or nullReplacement are null.\r\n\r\n- Examples:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT array_join(array('hello', 'world'), ' ');\r\nhello world\r\n\r\n> SELECT array_join(array('hello', NULL ,'world'), ' ');\r\nhello world\r\n\r\n> SELECT array_join(array('hello', NULL ,'world'), ' ', ',');\r\nhello , world\r\n```\r\n- See also:\r\nspark - https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#array_join\r\npresto - https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/array.html\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- This change added tests in CollectionFunctionsITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

the elements' data type in the given array is string. The delimiter is a string that separates each pair of consecutive elements of the array. The optional nullReplacement is a string that replaces null elements in the array. If nullReplacement is not specified, null elements in the array will be omitted from the resulting string. Returns null if the input array and delimiter are null.\r\n \r\n- Syntax:\r\n`array_join(array, delimiter, [, null_replacement])`\r\n\r\n- Arguments:\r\narray: An ARRAY to be handled.\r\ndelimiter: A STRING used to separate the concatenated array elements.\r\nnull_replacement: A STRING used to express a NULL value in the result. It is a optional\r\n\r\n- Return:\r\nreturns a string that represents the concatenation of the elements in the given array and the elements' data type in the given array is string.\r\nReturns null if input array or delimiter or nullReplacement are null.\r\n\r\n- Examples:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT array_join(array('hello', 'world'), ' ');\r\nhello world\r\n\r\n> SELECT array_join(array('hello', NULL ,'world'), ' ');\r\nhello world\r\n\r\n> SELECT array_join(array('hello', NULL ,'world'), ' ', ',');\r\nhello , world\r\n```\r\n- See also:\r\nspark - https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#array_join\r\npresto - https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/array.html\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- This change added tests in CollectionFunctionsITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement the array_sort function to extract a subset of elements from an array.\r\n\r\nReturns the array in sorted order. Sorts the input array in ascending or descending order according to the natural ordering of the array elements. NULL elements are placed at the beginning of the returned array in ascending order or at the end of the returned array in descending order. If the array itself is null, the function will return null. The optional ascendingOrder argument defaults to true if not specified.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nARRAY_SORT for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n\r\n`ARRAY_SORT(array, [ascendingOrder])`\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\narray: The array we want to sort.\r\nascendingOrder: this is an option, default and true stand for ascending order, false stand for descending order.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns:  \r\nif the array is null or ascendingOrder is null return null. if array is empty return empty.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT([5, 3, 2, 1, 0, null])\r\nOutput: [null, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT([5, 3, 2, 1, 0, null], true)\r\nOutput: [null, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT([null, 1, 2, 3, 5], false)\r\nOutput: [5, 3, 2, 1, null]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SORT(null)\r\nnull\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ARRAY_SLICE(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], null)\r\nnull\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee also:\r\nspark: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#array_sort\r\ndatabrick:https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/functions/array_sort.html\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- This change added tests in CollectionFunctionsITCase.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nApache Avro 1.11.2 contains an important fix: [AVRO-3536](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-3536)\r\nJust want to make sure it makes it into the next Flink release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nBumped up Apache Avro version to 1.11.2\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **yes**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T19:49:02Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T16:34:48Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T02:37:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5499479df5758a9a1bc28814b7cde91ccd3753c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8643ddd2e8f55ecbc15bd8b49c73cd97648a8b28","head":{"label":"m8719-github:avro-bump","ref":"avro-bump","sha":"8643ddd2e8f55ecbc15bd8b49c73cd97648a8b28","user":{"login":"m8719-github","id":94992805,"node_id":"U_kgDOBal5pQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94992805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github","html_url":"https://github.com/m8719-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":540861791,"node_id":"R_kgDOIDzlXw","name":"flink","full_name":"m8719-github/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"m8719-github","id":94992805,"node_id":"U_kgDOBal5pQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94992805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github","html_url":"https://github.com/m8719-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m8719-github/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/m8719-github/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSeems that we have not replaced the `flink-rpc-akka` module with `flink-rpc-pekko`, but the hint message has pointed to it. When we execute the command following the hint, the exception raises.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Could not find the selected project in the reactor: flink-rpc/flink-rpc-pekko\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Replace the \"flink-rpc-pekko\" in hint message with \"flink-rpc-akka\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T15:56:46Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T07:52:51Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T10:15:05Z","merged_at":"2023-08-08T10:15:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"28d94e826e4c2a0444fda8103641eb1c64a2223f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/177adbdbcd3a66caad03f3438ef836ceced1f689","head":{"label":"jiangxin369:hotfix-for-pekko","ref":"hotfix-for-pekko","sha":"177adbdbcd3a66caad03f3438ef836ceced1f689","user":{"login":"jiangxin369","id":21049075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21049075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333335437,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzMzMzU0Mzc=","name":"flink","full_name":"jiangxin369/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxin369","id":21049075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21049075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369/flink","description":"Apache

logs\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Back up the logs.*\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T13:52:03Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T08:18:00Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T07:46:07Z","merged_at":"2023-08-09T07:46:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"5654eb798c744c924aff93d68ec3c4e413e75232","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/68af0595b7ee6e253845640457b1b793d443d2c0","head":{"label":"fsk119:fix-e2e","ref":"fix-e2e","sha":"68af0595b7ee6e253845640457b1b793d443d2c0","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis is an implementation of ARRAY_CONCAT\r\n\r\nThe array_concat() function concatenates at least one array, creating an array that contains all the elements in the first array followed by all the elements in the second array ... followed by all the elements in the n array.\r\n\r\n### Brief change log\r\nARRAY_CONCAT for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\nSyntax:\r\n`ARRAY_CONCAT(arr1, tail...)\r\n`\r\nArguments:\r\narray: at least one ARRAY to be handled.\r\n\r\nReturns:\r\nThe function returns NULL if any input argument is NULL.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n`Flink SQL> SELECT array_concat(array[1, 2, 3, null, 3], array[3], array[5]);\r\n[1, 2, 3, null, 3, 3, 5]`\r\n\r\nsee also:\r\nGoogle Cloud BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/array_functions#array_concat\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- This change added tests in CollectionFunctionsITCase.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n- Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n- The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): (yes)\r\n- The serializers: (no)\r\n- The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n- Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n- The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

These maps should have a common map type. If there are overlapping keys, the value from 'map2' will overwrite the value from 'map1',  the value from 'map3' will overwrite the value from 'map2',  the value from 'mapn' will overwrite the value from 'map(n-1)'. If any of maps is null, return null.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nMAP_UNION for Table API and SQL\r\n\r\n- Syntax:\r\n`MAP_UNION(map1, ...)`\r\n- Arguments:\r\nmap1:The first map to be merged.\r\nmap2:The second map to be merged.\r\nmapn: the n map to be merged\r\n- Returns: If there are overlapping keys, the value from 'map2' will overwrite the value from 'map1',  the value from 'map3' will overwrite the value from 'map2',  the value from 'mapn' will overwrite the value from 'map(n-1)'. If any of maps is null, return null.\r\n- Examples:\r\n\r\nMerging maps with unique keys:\r\n```\r\nmap1 = ['a': 1, 'b': 2] map2 = ['c': 3, 'd': 4] \r\nmap_union(map1, map2)  \r\nOutput: ['a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMerging maps with overlapping keys:\r\n```\r\nmap1 = ['a': 1, 'b': 2] map2 = ['b': 3, 'c': 4] \r\nmap_union(map1, map2) \r\nOutput: ['a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- This change added tests in MapFunctionITCase.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request loosens PyFlink dependencies to make the library compatible with a wider range of other Python data libraries, including more recent releases of major libraries like pandas, Ibis, etc.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Relax or remove the upper bounds for a lot of PyFlink dependencies\r\n  - Replace deprecated `pd.DataFrame.iteritems()` with `pd.DataFrame.items()`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: don't know\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\nthe pr is to improve file object manage\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently `CatalogManager` can load catalog from `CatalogStore`, but we cannot perform ddl for the loaded catalog. This pr aims to support these operations.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add catalog loaded from `CatalogStore` to `catalogs` in `CatalogManager`\r\n  - Get catalog from method `getCatalog` instead of `catalogs.get` for operations such as ddl and list tables/views\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test case `CatalogManagerTest.testExistingCatalogInStore`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

of Asynchronous Problem in Querying Data from HBase\r\n\r\nWhen sync is not enabled, the HBaseRowDataLookupFunction object will be created. When entering this method, you notice that an HTable table is declared, but it is not immediately assigned. Instead, it is assigned in the open method. In actual development, a connection object is created in the open method, which is secure. If used, it will be closed. If it is a Table object, it is not safe. It is recommended to turn it off after using it. However, in the code, it can be seen that it is created in the open method and closed in the close method. If the data source continues to come, the close method will not execute. If it is a connected object, it is not a problem. If it is a table object, using the same object when processing each piece of data will cause problems. In the lookup method, if you want to query data in HBase, you must first create an object called the table get (get) method. When querying data, you use the same data, which may result in inaccurate data. If it is multithreaded, it will be unsafe\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-03T16:50:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T12:08:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/30618a118c1bc19d4fb9b1a6495bd41ac869350f","head":{"label":"GududeDog:master","ref":"master","sha":"30618a118c1bc19d4fb9b1a6495bd41ac869350f","user":{"login":"GududeDog","id":98301148,"node_id":"U_kgDOBdv03A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98301148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog","html_url":"https://github.com/GududeDog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":674241943,"node_id":"R_kgDOKDAdlw","name":"flink","full_name":"GududeDog/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GududeDog","id":98301148,"node_id":"U_kgDOBdv03A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98301148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog","html_url":"https://github.com/GududeDog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GududeDog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GududeDog/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo add the doc for call procedures\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Add the doc for how to develop a procedure\r\n- Add the doc for how to call the procedure\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- N/A\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-03T11:25:28Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:11:31Z","closed_at":"2023-08-18T02:20:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5b33f4dd80baea970d1e8aec1ea951b60028607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fad9e39b1d8aa491cc63146f04651ecd9d3b54b2","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-32356-doc-procedures","ref":"FLINK-32356-doc-procedures","sha":"fad9e39b1d8aa491cc63146f04651ecd9d3b54b2","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache
