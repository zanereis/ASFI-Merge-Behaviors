pr is part of #5883 , consists of 2 small improvements.\r\n\r\n1. Add `kMaxRegistersPerBlock` to device api, mainly used for CUDA api to get the local memory limitation;\r\n\r\n2. Add vectorize check to VerifyGPUCode pass depending on the vectorized block data size, nvcc has more strict limitations than llvm\r\n\r\nThe rest 2 bug fix will be in seperate PRs.\r\n~~~\r\n3. Update RewriteSimplify to fix a bug occurred in vectorized GPU shared memory cooperative fetching.\r\nTest cases are in `tests/python/unittest/test_te_schedule_gpu_advanced.py`, see `test_vectorized_cooperative_fetching_x()` and `test_vectorized_cooperative_fetching_xy()` for more information.\r\n\r\nCode generated with bug is shown like this:\r\n```\r\nA.shared[ramp(((ax0.ax1.fused.outer.outer*256) + (threadIdx.x_1*4)), 1, 4)] =\r\n(float32x4*)A_2[(((broadcast(((floordiv(blockIdx.x, 4)*32768) + (ax0.ax1.fused.outer.outer*2048)), 4) + (floordiv(ramp((threadIdx.x_1*4), 1, 4), broadcast(64, 4))*broadcast(512, 4))) + broadcast((k.outer.outer*64), 4)) + floormod(ramp((threadIdx.x_1*4), 1, 4), broadcast(64, 4)))])\r\n```\r\nWhich will finally lower to wrong CUDA C instructions.\r\nThis should be simplified to generate the correct RampNode:\r\n```\r\nA.shared[ramp(((ax0.ax1.fused.outer.outer*256) + (threadIdx.x_1*4)), 1, 4)] =\r\n(float32x4*)A_2[ramp((((((floordiv(blockIdx.x, 4)*32768) + (ax0.ax1.fused.outer.outer*2048)) + (floordiv(threadIdx.x_1, 16)*512)) + (k.outer.outer*64)) + (floormod(threadIdx.x_1, 16)*4)), 1, 4)])\r\n```\r\n4. Add LegalizeInvalidAttach in `schedule_dataflow_rewrite.cc`\r\nThis function legalizes the compute_at location if the target iterator of compute_at was split or fused. The following two cases will crash if we don't use this function.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import te\r\n\r\nA = te.compute((10, 10), lambda i, j: 1.0, name='A')\r\nB = te.compute((10, 10), lambda i, j: A[i][j], name='B')\r\n\r\n# Case 1: Split an axis which is the target of a compute_at\r\ns = te.create_schedule([B.op])\r\ns[A].compute_at(s[B], B.op.axis[1])\r\ns[B].split(B.op.axis[1], 2)\r\n\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))\r\n\r\n# Case 2: Fuse an axis which is the target of a compute_at\r\ns = te.create_schedule([B.op])\r\ns[A].compute_at(s[B], B.op.axis[1])\r\ns[B].fuse(B.op.axis[0], B.op.axis[1])\r\n\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, [A, B], simple_mode=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe rebuild the attach relation in`Schedule::normalize()` to fix this.\r\n~~~","created_at":"2020-06-23T11:22:41Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T05:56:59Z","closed_at":"2020-06-25T05:44:40Z","merged_at":"2020-06-25T05:44:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"074a07ede031762afb755f8b9273c0afb55c8b4a","assignee":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5898/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5898/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5898/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ca60784c17a55dbf95dcf7601270c6f1d465e7b1","head":{"label":"jcf94:jcf_github_tvm/gpu_related_bug_fix","ref":"jcf_github_tvm/gpu_related_bug_fix","sha":"ca60784c17a55dbf95dcf7601270c6f1d465e7b1","user":{"login":"jcf94","id":12119698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE5Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12119698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94","html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":218702844,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg3MDI4NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jcf94/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jcf94","id":12119698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTE5Njk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12119698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94","html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcf94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jcf94/tvm","description":"Open

Background\r\nAs demonstrated in TVM runtime [tutorials](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/relay_quick_start.html), TVM already supports WASM as the optional hardware backend, so we can leverage the features of WebAssembly (portability, security) and TVM runtime (domain-specific, optimization) to build a flexible and auto-optimized operator backend for all deep learning frameworks.\r\n\r\n## Proposal Summary\r\nThis PR is mainly proposed to add new TVM application extension that provides WASM operator backend for deep learning frameworks with TVM runtime. We believe it would bring some new ideas by combining WASM runtime with TVM compiler stack.\r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing this proposal, considering it's at the **experimental** stage to incubation, so any suggestions or questions are welcomed.

all,\r\n\r\nIn [[RFC] Ansor: An Auto-scheduler for TVM (AutoTVM v2.0)](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-ansor-an-auto-scheduler-for-tvm-autotvm-v2-0/7005), we've introduced the auto-scheduler **Ansor**.  In the RFC, we reached an agreement that we should replace AutoTVM with Ansor.\r\nFor most existing templates, current Ansor can directly replace them with better performance and less tuning time.\r\nFor other special templates (low-precision, sparse), the plan is to introduce search space customization and gradually rewrite them with Ansor's new API.\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR according to the integration plan mentioned in the RFC.\r\nThis PR contains the infrastructure for search (the definition of state and actions) and small modifications outside the Ansor folder.\r\n\r\n# Infrastructure for search: A lightweight IR\r\nAutomatic scheduling is a search problem. For a search problem, we need to define the states and actions.\r\nThe state of schedule search is the loop structure defined by the schedule (i.e., the TVM IR created by `tvm.lower`). The actions are schedule primitives to manipulate the loop structures (e.g., split, reorder, fuse).\r\n\r\nTo enable flexible manipulation of the loop structures, we implemented a lightweight loop structure IR (Intermediate Representation) specifically for search. We also implemented all schedule primitives for this IR. Basically, it is a simplified TVM IR. We don't use the existing TVM IR because: \r\n1. We want fast incremental change to the loop structures\r\n2. We want serializable transform history for replay, backtracking, and mutation\r\n3. We may create some macro schedule primitives\r\n\r\nAfter the search is done, we will lower this IR to TVM IR with TVM schedule primitives.\r\n\r\n## Key data structures\r\n\r\n- `ComputeDAG`: Compute declaration graph and its related analysis tools\r\nRelated files: `src/ansor/compute_dag.*`, `python/tvm/ansor/compute_dag.py`\r\nThis is the entrance data structure of Ansor. Ansor takes a compute declaration described by `tvm.compute` as input and converts it to this data structure for analysis.\r\n- `TransformStep`: This defines the \"action\" for the search problem, i.e., the schedule primitives for our IR.\r\nRelated files: `src/ansor/transform_step.*`, `python/tvm/ansor/loop_state.py`\r\nEach step has its corresponding `tvm.te` schedule primitives. We record all `TransformStep` for every state as its transform history. After the search is done, these transform steps will be lowered with their corresponding TVM's schedule primitives.\r\n- `State`:  This defines the \"state\" for the search problem, i.e., the current loop structure and history transform steps to reach this state.\r\nRelated files: `src/ansor/loop_state.*`, `python/tvm/ansor/loop_state.py`\r\nA state consists of a current loop structure and the transform history to reach its current loop structure.\r\nThe loop structure keeps a preview of how the schedule will finally look like after lowering (how many iterators, the extent of each iter, the location of some iterators if they have been done compute_at...), which can help the search policy to make decisions during the search.\r\nThe history is a sequence of `TransformStep` which will finally be mapped to schedule primitives.\r\n\r\n## Example Walkthrough\r\nWhile the search policy is implemented in C++, we also provide a python API for the new IR.\r\nThis is intended to be used by users for space customization. They look very similar to existing schedule primitives, as shown in `python/tvm/ansor/loop_state.py`. The API design is ongoing and may get updated later.\r\n\r\nTake `tests/python/unittest/test_ansor_loop_state.py:test_split_fuse_reorder_annotation()` for example, we can print out the test state `s1` as:\r\n```python\r\n>>> print(s1)\r\n\r\nPlaceholder: A, B\r\ngpu.blockIdx.x i.0 (0,32)\r\n  vthread i.1 (0,8)\r\n    gpu.threadIdx.y i.2 (0,2)\r\n      parallel j.0 (0,32)\r\n        unroll j.1 (0,8)\r\n          vectorize j.2 (0,2)\r\n            for k (0,512)\r\n              C = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe state stores all history transform steps required to reach this state. We can print the history transform steps as TVM's python API.\r\n```python\r\n>>> print(dag.print_python_code_from_state(s1))\r\n\r\ni, j, k = tuple(C.op.axis) + tuple(C.op.reduce_axis)\r\ni_o_i, i_i = s[C].split(i, factor=2)\r\ni_o_o, i_o_i = s[C].split(i_o_i, factor=8)\r\nj_o, j_i_o = s[C].split(j, nparts=32)\r\nj_i_o, j_i_i = s[C].split(j_i_o, nparts=8)\r\ns[C].parallel(j_o)\r\ns[C].unroll(j_i_o)\r\ns[C].vectorize(j_i_i)\r\ns[C].bind(i_o_o, tvm.thread_axis(\"blockIdx.x\"))\r\ns[C].bind(i_o_i, tvm.thread_axis(\"vthread\"))\r\ns[C].bind(i_i, tvm.thread_axis(\"threadIdx.y\"))\r\n```\r\nOr replay these steps to get a schedule for `tvm.lower` and `tvm.build`.\r\n```python\r\ns, args = dag.apply_steps_from_state(s1)\r\nprint(tvm.lower(s, args, simple_mode=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe steps of this state can be serialized into the log file as:\r\n```json\r\n[[\"SP\", 2, 0, 512, [8, 2], 1], [\"SP\", 2, 3, 512, [32, 8], 0], [\"AN\", 2, 3, 3], [\"AN\", 2, 4, 1], [\"AN\", 2, 5, 2], [\"AN\", 2, 0, 5], [\"AN\", 2, 1, 4], [\"AN\", 2, 2, 8]]\r\n```\r\nAnsor serializes all transform steps to the log file. This is different from AutoTVM which only serializes parameters.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn the next few PRs, we'll introduce search policy and tutorials for single op/ subgraph schedule search, relay integration and tutorials for end-to-end network schedule search, custom rules to support customized search space. When Ansor is able to fully support AutoTVM's features, we can gradually deprecate AutotVM.\r\n\r\nThis is a joint work by @merrymercy @jcf94 @minminsun  @FrozenGene  @comaniac  @yangjunpro @yidawang

PR brings a major refactor to the tir::Call structure.\r\nThe current Call structure uses a string field(name) to identify the\r\nfunction/intrinsic being called. This approach is limited as we start\r\nto expand TIR to be more structured. In particular, we are interested in\r\nthe following aspects:\r\n\r\n- Type a function and perform better compile time type checking so that we\r\n  can find errors early.\r\n- Register additional properties about an operator, such as:\r\n  - Whether an intrinsic can be vectorized\r\n  - What is the adjoint function of the intrinsic(for tensor expression AD)\r\n  - Whether the operator has side effect.\r\n- Perform specific codegen about an intrinsic if necessary.\r\n- Call into another function in the same module.\r\n\r\nThe refactor changes the Call.name field to Call.op.\r\nThe Call.op field has a RelayExpr type, and we can pass:\r\n\r\n- A tvm::Op which represents the corresponding intrinsic.\r\n- A tvm::GlobalVar for calling into another function in the IRModule.\r\n\r\nAll the current intrinsics are migrated by registering an tvm::Op.\r\nBecause the unified IR shares a single Op registry. We use the \"tir\"\r\nnamespace for tir related intrinsics, for example bitwise and is now registered\r\nunder `tir.bitwise_and`.\r\n\r\nTo simplify upgrade, we introduce `tir.call_extern` intrinsic\r\nthat allows us to call into arbitary external function without type checking.\r\nHowever, we should move towards more type checked variants in the system.\r\n\r\nUnder the new op design. We should no longer try to pattern match all the\r\nspecific intrincis. Instead, we should rely on attr of each Op to do transformation.\r\nFor example, the vectorization pass depends on the TVectorizable property of the op,\r\nwhich can be registered independently.\r\n\r\nIn this way, we can still grow the number of intrinsics when necessary\r\nwithout having to change all the passes.\r\n\r\nThe same rule applies for tensor expression AD. Currently we are performing\r\nAD by pattern match on operators like exp, sin, cos. We should instead\r\nchange to the ajoint registeration mechanism like those in relay.\r\n\r\nFollowup refactors need to be performed, including:\r\n- Fold the Call.call_type into operator's attribute.\r\n- Enrich the operator registry information\r\n- Refactor passes(e.g. AD, intrin lowering) to use the attribute based transformation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Note\r\n\r\nIf you are using an raw intrinsic API, likely we need to add the `tir.` prefix to it. \r\n- `call_pure_intrin(x.dtype, 'tir.exp', [x])`\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-21T02:20:25Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T23:00:47Z","closed_at":"2020-06-23T00:47:02Z","merged_at":"2020-06-23T00:47:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"82d157f0b83ae17fde7bbfca14110aa2f2b80b61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/112f3b71e6fdd5ad0ca8c1b8099a6864c665830c","head":{"label":"tqchen:call-op-refactor","ref":"call-op-refactor","sha":"112f3b71e6fdd5ad0ca8c1b8099a6864c665830c","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.git

discussion: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/latest-tvm-failed-to-build-on-mac-osx-with-llvm10/6993\r\n\r\nThe issue is found to be caused by LLVM's CMake returning nothing: `llvm_map_components_to_libnames(LLVM_LIBS \"all\")`. To fix this, this patch checks if \"LLVM_LIBS\" is empty, and if so, it falls back to use \"llvm-config\" to configure the project.\r\n\r\nCould you confirm on your side?

fixes a few months ago to the `get_valid_counts` CUDA implementation broke OpenCL  because of the atomic add intrinsic which was added.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `get_valid_counts` for OpenCL with the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Register intrinsic atomic add for OpenCL. \r\n2. Override `intrinsic::tvm_address_of` to include storage scope (e.g.` __global`).\r\n3. Enable `cl_khr_global_int32_base_atomics`. This isn't required for [OpenCL 1.1+ because atomic_add became a core feature](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/2.2/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_int32_atomics). I'm happy to remove this if we don't care about OpenCL 1.0. Alternatively we can override `op->call_type == CallNode::PureExtern` and set a flag to enable this only when `atomic_add` is actually used.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal error messages before this fix:\r\n\r\n1. During compilation:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  Unresolved intrinsic atomic_add with return type int32\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n2. During runtime:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  <source>:6922:43: error: casting '__global void *' to type 'int *' changes address space of pointer\r\n        atomic_add_return[(0)] = atomic_add(((int *)get_valid_counts_v0 + 0), 1);\r\n

In a \"fail early\" philosphy, This PR adds an earlier check for dynamic shapes and throws with a hopefully more useful error message. Once we have heterogenous execution working on the VM, we can relax the check on the VM

PR, coupled with [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm-vta/pull/9) on tvm-vta repo, is the basic implementation of RFC #5840 \r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n- this is just a basic version without much performance optimization. We've done some optimization, and achieved significant improvement (but this part of code is not ready; has to be organized and cleaned up further).\r\n- there are some experimental features, which are also included in this PR, including\r\n    - sync all the instructions per model (instead of per layer)\r\n    - static auto-tune using profiling results\r\n  \r\n  These codes are not well styled (using some environmental variables), and we have to think about how to format/implement nicely. But we think these features are useful so we also commit. We can discuss if we should include these codes in this PR, or leave it for other PRs.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-18T14:59:49Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T01:59:16Z","closed_at":"2020-10-11T18:38:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee3c42851ae25b8049e5c04ea082d676b33b65aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/348fb91b6ba34b2df771d73d588370e612b5cd1e","head":{"label":"4paradigm:feature/opencl","ref":"feature/opencl","sha":"348fb91b6ba34b2df771d73d588370e612b5cd1e","user":{"login":"4paradigm","id":24433472,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0NDMzNDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24433472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm","html_url":"https://github.com/4paradigm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224627385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQ2MjczODU=","name":"canopy","full_name":"4paradigm/canopy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"4paradigm","id":24433472,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0NDMzNDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24433472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm","html_url":"https://github.com/4paradigm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/4paradigm/canopy","description":"Canopy is a machine learning learning compiler stack with the capability of adopting high-end FPGAs.

is a workaround for the issue reported in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/39690\r\n\r\nIn short, if a quantized PyTorch model is serialized and loaded back, dtypes of output tensors are dropped and the loaded model doesn't have  `QUInt8` types at all.\r\n\r\nThis becomes a problem when converting some Torch ops. For example,  below the output dtype of `quantize_per_tensor` becomes float (`Tensor` means float tensor, wrong), so `aten::adaptive_avg_pool2d` thinks this is a float operation. But obviously the output of `aten::quantize_per_tensor` should be a quantized tensor, so `aten::adaptive_avg_pool2d` has to be converted to the quantized version.\r\n\r\n The quantized resnet in torchvision uses `aten::adaptive_avg_pool2d`. So right now if we save and load back the qresnet, we get garbage result.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  %input.1 : Tensor = aten::quantize_per_tensor(%X.1, %7, %8, %9) # /home/masa/anaconda3\r\n  ...\r\n  %Xq.1 : Tensor = aten::adaptive_avg_pool2d(%input.1, %12)\r\n```  \r\n\r\nplease review @siju-samuel @anijain2305 \r\ncc @jjohnson-arm

Also add code comments.\r\n  - More thorough: Have a more principled way of testing a bunch of different Relay programs. Cover all ops, combinations of ops, etc etc. Maybe error out if a Relay construct is not tested, so that the test keeps getting updated in the future.\r\n  - More extensible: Make it easy to add more tests in the future.\r\n- [x] (@gussmith23) Go through TODOs in code, put them in this list\r\n- [x] Settle on a design for exactly how bitwidths work\r\n  + Lowering by custom datatype currently works only based on the result type. That is, an add with type result `custom[posit]16` and an add with type `custom[posit]32` will actually use the same lowering function.\r\n    This is alright if the user's lowering function is aware of it, and lowers differently based on bitwidth. However, the lowering function generated by `create_lower_func()` is *not* aware of this, and does *not* lower to different functions based on bitwidth. This means that the easiest way to dispatch at the moment is to use different datatype names for each datatype you'd like to implement, e.g. `custom[posit16]16` and `custom[posit32]32`. This is unnatural and clunky, though.\r\n    There are many potential ways to fix this.\r\n      - A solution that makes deeper changes to the framework could register different lowering functions for different bitwidths. Effectively, this would mean changing the format of the strings under which lowering functions are registered in the registry, adding in fields for bitwidth. This would change the `register_op` API -- not only would it include datatype, target, and op, but also bitwidth (at the very least -- potentially vector lanes too?)\r\n      - A simpler (but I'm not necessarily sure better) solution would be to change `create_lower_func()` so that it can create a lowering function that lowers to different function calls based on bitwidth. This could work fine -- the user would just have to provide all function names for all supported bitwidths all at once. \r\n    \r\n- [ ] Rebase and package up follow-on work\r\n  + [ ] Branch which
