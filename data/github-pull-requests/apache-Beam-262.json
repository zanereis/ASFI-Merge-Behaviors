@dhalperi @tgroh \n\nThe PubsubUnboundendSource implementation has an assertion to confirm the checkpoint from which a fresh reader is instantiated has come via deserialization from an earlier finalized checkpoint. The in-process runner was reusing the checkpoint object directly, so the assertion failed.

is a cleanup version of #328, this time for real.\n\nThe interesting things are in `FlinkPartialReduceFunction`/`FlinkReduceFunction`, `FlinkMergingPartialReduceFunction`/`FlinkMergingReduceFunction` and `FlinkMergingNonShuffleReduceFunction`. The handle all windowing. What the `ReduceFnRunner` would do is implemented here but without any regard for triggers. All of these implement special cases of windowing: the first two are for general, non-merging windows, the second set is for doing a `GroupByKey`, the last one is for merging windows. In the last case we cannot do a pre-shuffle combine step because elements are not necessarily in the correct windows prior to the shuffle and merging of windows. We need to have the correct window for side-input access.\n\nR: @kennknowles and @mxm for

change sits on top of #291 \n\nWith this we can run all of the `RunnableOnService` tests on the Flink batch runner. Almost all of our own Flink-specific IT cases fail now because they verified the older, non-complete support for the Beam model. I did not remove them, since we should discuss whether we want to keep them, or keep only those that test a specific integration with Beam. If we want to keep them they have to be fixed.\n\nFor now `CombineTest.testSessionsCombineWithContext` fails. I'm inserting a pre-shuffle combine phase but with merging windows the correct, final window in which an element will reside is not yet know in the pre-shuffle combine. This means that we don't get the correct side input for those values in the `CombineFnWithContext`. To fix the failing test I can get rid of the pre-shuffle combine, this means that we have more network traffic but are correct. What are the thought on this?\n\nFor GroupByKey/Combine.PerKey I'm doing a shuffle by key and then an in-memory pass over the windows. For non-merging windows this could also be changed to do a shuffle by key-and-window but then we would have to explode all windows on the send side.\n\n**This is the text from the commit in question:**\n\n   [BEAM-270] Support Timestamps/Windows in Flink Batch\n\n```\nWith this change we always use WindowedValue<T> for the underlying Flink\nDataSets instead of just T. This allows us to support windowing as well.\n\nThis changes also a lot of other stuff enabled by the above:\n\n - Use WindowedValue throughout\n - Add proper translation for Window.into()\n - Make side inputs window aware\n - Make GroupByKey and Combine transformations window aware, this\n   includes support for merging windows. GroupByKey is implemented as a\n   Combine with a concatenating CombineFn, for simplicity\n\nThis removes Flink specific transformations for things that are handled\nby builtin sources/sinks, among other things this:\n\n - Removes special translation for AvroIO.Read/Write and\n   TextIO.Read/Write\n - Removes special support for Write.Bound, this was not working properly\n   and is now handled by the Beam machinery that uses DoFns for this\n - Removes special translation for binary Co-Group, the code was still\n   in there but was never used\n\nWith this change all RunnableOnService tests run on Flink Batch.\n```\n\nR: @mxm for Flink review\nR: @kennknowles, you are probably interested in how the shuffle/reduce works\n","created_at":"2016-05-12T15:41:25Z","updated_at":"2016-06-19T09:39:11Z","closed_at":"2016-05-19T19:33:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a2c988cfd9d6f80f06b60777c1a2e6a494233410","head":{"label":"aljoscha:flink-windowed-value-batch","ref":"flink-windowed-value-batch","sha":"a2c988cfd9d6f80f06b60777c1a2e6a494233410","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55508677,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTUwODY3Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"aljoscha/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha/beam","description":"Mirror

However, I'd like to have the community to get a feel of what Gearpump is like, whether Beam and Gearpump go well, and gather ideas for improvements.

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis fixes a TOCTOU race in the contents updating logic, where the\ndetermination that the current pane should replace the contents of the\nside input and the replacement is not a single atomic operation. Using\nAtomicReference allows the use of compareAndSet to ensure that the\nreplacement can only occur on the pane that the decision to replace was\nmade with.\n\nFixes a race where a pane could be the latest, and replace a\npane, but would be lost due to an earlier pane being written between the\ninvalidation and loading of contents.\n\nFixes a race where a reader can incorrectly read an empty iterable as\nthe contents of a PCollectionView, due to occuring between the\ninvalidate and reload steps.\n","created_at":"2016-05-10T20:29:12Z","updated_at":"2016-05-11T17:43:08Z","closed_at":"2016-05-11T17:43:08Z","merged_at":"2016-05-11T17:43:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"7747599233aee96c8077c46db5ce093a856b6139","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/7747599233aee96c8077c46db5ce093a856b6139","head":{"label":"tgroh:atomic_reference_side_input_container","ref":"atomic_reference_side_input_container","sha":"7747599233aee96c8077c46db5ce093a856b6139","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror
