href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.6.0</h2>\n<p>Hey, gophers! Do you know what time it is? It is that time of the year again! That time when we all gather together to share our time with friends and family to celebrate <strong>ANOTHER AWESOME WAZERO RELEASE</strong>!</p>\n<p>Notably, this release includes the first public experimental release of the <strong>long-awaited, highly-requested multi-pass optimizing compiler</strong>! Keep reading for more details!</p>\n<p>A huge thanks to all the contributors, old and new, and always remember that all the developers hang out at the [Gophers Slack][gophers] in the #wazero channel; and if you haven’t already you can <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/stargazers\">star</a> our repo. You know, Santa is making a list, and checking it twice.</p>\n<p>It’s been a while since v1.5.0, but we promise <strong>v1.6.0</strong> was <strong>worth the wait</strong>! Fun facts about v1.6.0:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is the best release since the last one.</li>\n<li>This release is 100% richer in holiday cheer.  ❄️🎄</li>\n<li>Mulled wine is a fantastic developer productivity boost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Optimizing Compiler</h2>\n<p>Jokes aside, we have a lot to cheer about! The <strong>lion share</strong> of this release is obviously our <strong>brand new optimizing compiler</strong> (codename “wazevo”) now available as an <strong>experimental feature for arm64</strong> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/1496\">#1496</a>)!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> led the design and implementation. Work started this summer, and it has evolved in a few iterations over the last months. Initial focus has been on general abstract infrastructure and support to the <strong>arm64</strong> instruction set as our first compilation target. <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> contributed to the arm64 backend with special focus on the SIMD instructions, and <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> helped improve the initial register allocator (this was then further evolved and eventually overhauled again by <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a>). <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> contributed with suggestions and testing.</p>\n<p>We held off a few releases to polish this new compiler and gain more confidence in the implementation. In this first public release, the optimizing compiler is only available for <strong>arm64</strong>. The journey to supporting <strong><em>amd64</em></strong> is set to begin soon with <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> leading the effort.</p>\n<p>The new compiler has been, as usual, <strong>extensively tested against</strong> the Wasm spec, our own unit tests, and against the standard libraries of TinyGo, Go and Zig; and of course it has also been hardened through hours-long fuzzing.</p>\n<p>You can enable the optimizing compiler by replacing <code>wazero.NewRuntimeConfigCompiler()</code> or <code>wazero.NewRuntimeConfig()</code> with the new experimental API as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code>-   \tc := wazero.NewRuntimeConfigCompiler()\n+   \tc := opt.NewRuntimeConfigOptimizingCompiler()\n-   \tc := wazero.NewRuntimeConfig()\n+   \tc := opt.NewRuntimeConfigOptimizingCompiler()\n</code></pre>\n<p>The CLI is now also exposing an experimental flag <code>-optimizing-compiler</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>wazero run -optimizing-compiler myapp.wasm\n</code></pre>\n<p>The optimizing compiler is an <strong>experimental feature</strong> so <strong>we welcome your input</strong>. It is also a <strong>work in progress</strong>: we implemented only a few optimization passes, guiding our choices through testing and benchmarking.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that <strong>WebAssembly is an interesting beast</strong>: since it is a compilation target, most compilers generate pre-optimized output; therefore, some traditional optimization passes may surprisingly only add build-time overhead and produce no observable improvement. However, our work there is far from being done: <strong>more optimization passes can be added</strong>; we invite you to do your experiments and bring your own suggestions. For instance, among others, we currently implement forms of <strong>dead-code elimination</strong>, and <strong>bounds-checking eliminations</strong>.</p>\n<p>In your experiments, you should also expect the <strong><code>CompileModule</code> phase to take a while longer than the old compiler</strong>: the difference may be noticeable with large modules; but you can still <strong>cache the result</strong>, so you can pay this cost only once. The <strong>good news</strong> is that, in our tests, the <strong>run-time should always visibly improve.</strong> Interestingly enough, there are also <strong>some cases where <em>both</em> compile-time and run-time have improved</strong>: this might be the case when the input module is not pre-optimized, and the dead-code elimination procedures kick in.</p>\n<p>For instance, the <strong>Zig standard library</strong> is about <strong>2x quicker</strong> to compile and <strong>4x faster</strong> to run than the old compiler. However, a pre-optimized test binary (<em>e.g.</em> pre-processed [using Binaryen’s <code>wasm-opt</code>][wasm-opt]) will be much faster to build on the old compiler, but the new compiler will still produce <em>2x</em> faster code. This is fully expected because <strong>the old compiler does a straightforward translation from input Wasm to native code</strong>: therefore, processing time tends to be low; but if the input is large, the generated output will be large. The new compiler is smarter, in that it is able to drop all the irrelevant code sections; in fact, processing time is about the same on both an optimized and unoptimized binary.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is: if you control the Wasm binary, run it through [<code>wasm-opt</code>][wasm-opt] and compare the result for your workload!</p>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

to fix - #30054\r\n\r\n# The issue identified\r\n\r\nThere were two issues in the JmsIO read checkpoint implementation\r\n\r\n1. checkpoint was a mutable member of the reader, returned to the runner each time getCheckpointMark is called:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/27f1c0774fd93e846de9a8b668e6effc5a41eb10/sdks/java/io/jms/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/jms/JmsIO.java#L600\r\n\r\nThis is not correct as the checkpoint by definition should not change after made. Here, record after the checkpoint made still add to the same checkpoint:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/27f1c0774fd93e846de9a8b668e6effc5a41eb10/sdks/java/io/jms/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/jms/JmsIO.java#L566\r\n\r\nWhen checkpoint is finalized (by finalizeCheckpoint call from runner), messages read between the checkpoint made and finalizing the checkpoint incorrectly gets acknowledged\r\n\r\n2. Jms specification of message acknowledgement\r\n\r\nIt is surprising, Jms message acknowledge isn't per message, but per session. The [spec](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19798-01/821-1841/bncfw/index.html) states\r\n\r\n> acknowledgment takes place on the session level: Acknowledging a consumed message automatically acknowledges the receipt of all messages that have been consumed by its session.\r\n\r\nEven if 1 is fixed, the symptom would remain the same as messages between checkpoint being made and the checkpoint finalized would get acknowledged.\r\n\r\n# The fix\r\n\r\nCorresponding to these two issues, two fixes are made\r\n\r\n1. Introduce `Checkpoint.Preparer` class pretty much the same as the original the mutable \"checkpoint\". Instead, when getCheckpointMark is called, it create an actual checkpoint for later use, and the Preparer is reset.\r\n\r\n2. Recreate session at the time checkpoint is made. In this way, the current session won't consume more data before that checkpoint is finalized.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Caveat\r\n\r\n1. Since the message is acknowledged by `finalizeCheckpoint` called anytime later, the current session needs to be alive otherwise the acknowledge will fail (see [diff](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/30218/files#diff-a63812b51f93708cc60430f314b496ae1110425c6a8ae4c85e59573cfb8f0938R207)). Therefore, the owner of current session is transferred from the Reader to the checkpoint. However, checkpoint finalization is best effort. If it does not happen, duplicate message may seen downstream.\r\n\r\n2. reader calls `consumer.receiveNoWait` to get a message. However, the Jms specification does not guarantee a  message will be returned (otherwise null) when there are unacknowledged messages on the server side. From the test, I find `receiveNoWait` of one consumer can return null when there is other consumer active (not closed). This leads to the integration test failing the original assert that all messages received by the sink when streaming pipeline timeout. There are always ~1-9 outstanding messages. Checking unacknowledged messages, there are ~10 unacknowledged. So there is no data loss here, but we have to adjust the test assertion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if close the consumer immediately after the checkpoint is made (but keep the session active), data gets consumed, not acknowledged, and even the associate session was still open, will get redelivered  into other sessions' consumers, causing a surge of duplication. So we still need to defer closing the consumer after acknowledge messages, along with closing the session\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Portals™!&quot;</h2>\n<p>This is the twelfth patch release in the 1.1.z release branch of runc.\nIt fixes a high-severity container breakout vulnerability involving\nleaked file descriptors, and users are strongly encouraged to update as\nsoon as possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv\">CVE-2024-21626</a>, a container breakout attack that took advantage of\na file descriptor that was leaked internally within runc (but never\nleaked to the container process).</p>\n<p>In addition to fixing the leak, several strict hardening measures were\nadded to ensure that future internal leaks could not be used to break\nout in this manner again.</p>\n<p>Based on our research, while no other container runtime had a similar\nleak, none had any of the hardening steps we've introduced (and some\nruntimes would not check for any file descriptors that a calling\nprocess may have leaked to them, allowing for container breakouts due\nto basic user error).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Static Linking Notices</h3>\n<p>The <code>runc</code> binary distributed with this release are <em>statically linked</em> with\nthe

of fixing #30169\r\n\r\nI have not completed debugging of the massive change at #29924 that would complete the issue. Instead, I am starting to break off pieces that are easier to complete, to shrink the final change.\r\n\r\nThis takes just the code from `sdks-java-fn-execution` and merges it into the core SDK. The dependencies look like this:\r\n\r\n`sdks-java-core` <--  `sdks-java-fn-execution` <-- `runners-core-construction-java`\r\n\r\nSo the merge must necessarily flatten all of those. This smaller merge is easier to accomplish first. I suspect it may also be easier to move all the code from one module to another and separate the gradle build changes.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR attempts to remove CoGBK from MLTransform's TFTProcessHandler. \r\n\r\nInstead of using CoGBK, encode the dict of columns not specified by the user into bytes and pass them in the original dict with a temporary key specified in the schema for TFT. In the TFT `AnalyzeDataset` or `TransformDataset`, this temp column would be a no-op. Once TFT is done processing data, decode the bytes into their actual format.\r\n\r\nThis only affects the data processing operations specified at `apache_beam/ml/transforms/tft.py`. The operations support float and string data. We have tests for them already. \r\n\r\nFor encoding and decoding purposes, I used `apache_beam/pickler` for now. \r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/29593\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is currently using go 1.20, but was accidentally depending on the go 1.21 standard libary versions of \"maps\" and \"slices\". This changes them to be the compatibility packages.\r\n\r\nWhile beam advocates using the latest release (go 1.21) of Go when using it (which avoids problems when compiling those targets), the occasionally subtle dependency semantics allowed for that mismatch, leading to the compiler error. (IIRC this is not a problem past 1.21, which has better tooling awareness, but won't cause regressions for packages authored before those semantics...)\r\n\r\nGoing to cherry pick this into the 2.54.0 release to restore the compatibility with go 1.20.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a memory leak as a result of the Data Manager read cache not evicting data streams for which it had not known it had seen all the data streams. \r\n\r\nSee the new comment in the code for details.\r\n\r\nWe don't take the alternative approach of checking the DataChannel's endedInstruction cache because it's possible that cache of instruction references might have a gap, with more than the current cache cap of ended instructions cycling through before the data channel is triggered to observe it. Best to check the cache's contents directly.\r\n\r\nFixes #28142.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to test for this unfortunately without significantly changing the code, as it's a goroutine local cache, and adding additional synchronization is undesirable.\r\n\r\nWhile this regression has been in the SDK for a while (since around February 2023) I'd like to cherry pick it into the 2.54.0 release so the ever patient user can finally upgrade to a newer SDK version.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

support labelled metrics by concatenating a base metric name with the metric labels. The characaters `-`, `:` and `;` are used as delimiters in this process. Using `-` as a delimiter causes issues since `-` can also be used a BQ table name. This PR replaces the `-` delimiter with `*` which cannot be used in table ids. (All other metric labels are generated from known enums so we do not need to worry about them).\r\n\r\nAdditionally changes:\r\n- In `BigQuerySinkMetrics::ParsedMetricName::parsemetricname` create string splitters with `limit(2)` when we split the base metric name from labels, and when we split a metric labels keys and values. This makes parsing more resilient incase delimiters are added to metric labels. \r\n- modify `BigQuerySinkMetrics::ParsedMetricName::parsemetricname` to return an empty `Optional` instead of null when parsing fails.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds support for defining **python** `callable` parameters for the built-in `Combine` transform as well as any transform defined using `PyTransform` or `ExternalProvider` registered with `python` or `pythonPackage`.\r\n\r\nExternal transforms defined using a `python` registered `ExternalProvider` use the `InlineProvider` when no python packages are defined. In this case, a special flag is passed to `InlineProvider` to tell it to allow `callable` parameters. This is to avoid interfering with built-in transform behavior, while allowing a user to expose the functionality within their own custom transform provider.\r\n\r\nThis will allow for more complex pipelines to be defined such as the one below:\r\n```\r\npipeline:\r\n  type: chain\r\n  transforms:\r\n    - type: Create\r\n      config:\r\n        elements:\r\n          - {'season': spring, 'produce': '🥕 Carrot'}\r\n          - {'season': spring, 'produce': '🍓 Strawberry'}\r\n          - {'season': summer, 'produce': '🥕 Carrot'}\r\n          - {'season': summer, 'produce': '🌽 Corn'}\r\n          - {'season': summer, 'produce': '🍏 Green apple'}\r\n          - {'season': fall, 'produce': '🥕 Carrot'}\r\n          - {'season': fall, 'produce': '🍏 Green apple'}\r\n          - {'season': winter, 'produce': '🍆 Eggplant'}\r\n    - type: ToCase\r\n      config:\r\n        fn_map:\r\n          upper:\r\n            __callable__: str.upper\r\n          lower:\r\n            __callable__: str.lower\r\n        suffix: 'x'\r\n    - type: Combine\r\n      config:\r\n        language: python\r\n        group_by: season\r\n        combine:\r\n          shortest:\r\n            value: produce\r\n            fn:\r\n              type: apache_beam.transforms.combiners.TopCombineFn\r\n              config:\r\n                n: 2\r\n                key:\r\n                  __callable__: 'lambda x: len(x)'\r\n                reverse: true\r\n    - type: Explode\r\n      config:\r\n        fields: [ shortest ]\r\n    - type: Filter\r\n      config:\r\n        language: python\r\n        keep:\r\n          callable: \"lambda x: x.season == 'SPRINGx'\"\r\n    - type: PyTransform\r\n      config:\r\n        constructor: apache_beam.transforms.core.Map\r\n        kwargs:\r\n          fn:\r\n            __callable__: print\r\noptions:\r\n  yaml_experimental_features: Combine\r\n\r\nproviders:\r\n  - type: python\r\n    config: {}\r\n    transforms:\r\n      'ToCase': |\r\n        @beam.ptransform_fn\r\n        def ToCase(pcoll, fn_map, suffix=''):\r\n          return pcoll | beam.Map(lambda x: beam.Row(season=fn_map['upper'](x.season) + suffix, produce=x.produce))\r\n```\r\nRunning the above pipeline prints the following output:\r\n```\r\nRow(season='SPRINGx', shortest='🥕 Carrot')\r\nRow(season='SPRINGx', shortest='🍓 Strawberry')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR proposes a new PTransform API, `setDisplayData`, for adding DisplayData items to the transform.\r\n\r\nMotivation: Adding DisplayData is easy to do via the `HasDisplayData#populateDisplayData` method that most transform-like types inherit. However, as a user and library owner, I don't always have access to the construction of the PTransform or DoFn and can't override `populateDisplayData`. For example, it would be difficult to add custom displayData labels to any of these transforms unless I wrapped them into new PTransforms:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    pipeline\r\n        .apply(Create.of(1, 2, 3))\r\n        .apply(\"Map Elements\", MapElements.via(...))\r\n        .apply(\"GBK\", GroupByKey.create())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a method `setDisplayData` that can be invoked on any PTransform instance.\r\n\r\nNote: I followed the convention of other setter methods in the PTransform class, i.e. [setResourceHints](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/v2.53.0/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/PTransform.java#L210), but it might be more intuitive to make it a `withDisplayData` method that returns the PTransform instance, so that users can use it like `pipeline.apply(Create.of(1, 2, 3).withDisplayData(...))` ?\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think! :)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
