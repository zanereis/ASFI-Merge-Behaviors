What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn InternalThreadLocalTest, testSize fails when run after testSetAndGet, testRemove, or testRemoveAll in the same test class. I found that running InternalThreadLocalMap.remove() before testSize ensures the starting state is correct such that testSize can pass even when run after those three tests. I introduced the setup method to ensure this resetting logic is run before each test. Please let me know if there is a more preferred way to address this issue.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nIncluding a setup method that sets the state through InternalThreadLocalMap.remove().\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-13T07:20:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-28T15:12:26Z","closed_at":"2021-11-28T15:12:26Z","merged_at":"2021-11-28T15:12:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"14a1d2e47d478b52e0541d940010f47fbe39778e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/439aa00c67caa6c6400f99fe10cb561d15cee9a7","head":{"label":"odrepa:fix-InternalThreadLocalTest","ref":"fix-InternalThreadLocalTest","sha":"439aa00c67caa6c6400f99fe10cb561d15cee9a7","user":{"login":"odrepa","id":94214029,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZ2XjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94214029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa","html_url":"https://github.com/odrepa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":427583798,"node_id":"R_kgDOGXxpNg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"odrepa/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"odrepa","id":94214029,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZ2XjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94214029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa","html_url":"https://github.com/odrepa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/odrepa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/odrepa/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-12T05:36:03Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T01:17:17Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T12:30:34Z","merged_at":"2021-11-18T12:30:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"f69c2f3c24793d809c71496f8517d13732364671","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5d4113d719dd0eb5237c31a8d7d83175bf422524","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/nacos_registry_memory_leak","ref":"fix/nacos_registry_memory_leak","sha":"5d4113d719dd0eb5237c31a8d7d83175bf422524","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-11T23:07:22Z","updated_at":"2021-12-05T13:49:11Z","closed_at":"2021-11-13T08:23:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4252be3a4bb2654a79f7520c29b403277b10357","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-11T08:02:07Z","updated_at":"2021-11-11T08:04:19Z","closed_at":"2021-11-11T08:04:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e2dc4000f98a12633ecfd6d5feeb0efc53e7140","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3f97eff1324df5ad70476ddc96bda778807543f1","head":{"label":"sunquanchao:master","ref":"master","sha":"3f97eff1324df5ad70476ddc96bda778807543f1","user":{"login":"sunquanchao","id":7067056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjcwNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunquanchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78493739,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODQ5MzczOQ==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sunquanchao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunquanchao","id":7067056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjcwNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunquanchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunquanchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunquanchao/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-09T15:06:59Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T05:40:38Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T05:40:37Z","merged_at":"2021-11-10T05:40:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae6c6a9a9ab1aa0b3d911243097a12ed4d00009d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ce6d3676d3ba97ca0dc63aef6bc0528ddd4d9707","head":{"label":"haoyann:fix-server-ssl","ref":"fix-server-ssl","sha":"ce6d3676d3ba97ca0dc63aef6bc0528ddd4d9707","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-09T14:50:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T05:35:29Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T05:35:29Z","merged_at":"2021-11-10T05:35:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"838493c4c4eaa09fe7291ef6e6963bf816475219","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/345b91a766af307a71c6669ff39f1eb27e83d179","head":{"label":"haoyann:fix-ssl-leak","ref":"fix-ssl-leak","sha":"345b91a766af307a71c6669ff39f1eb27e83d179","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe purpose of this change is to **fix 2 flaky tests** in the 3.0 version. \r\nThe following tests are flaky:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest.testGetAllMetaAnnotations\r\norg.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest.testGetMetaAnnotations\r\n```\r\nThe tests passes when run regular test command line:\r\n```\r\nmvn -pl dubbo-common test -Dtest=org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetAllMetaAnnotations\r\nmvn -pl dubbo-common test -Dtest=org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetMetaAnnotations\r\n```\r\nBut it fails when running the NonDex Tools:\r\n```\r\nmvn -pl dubbo-common edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetAllMetaAnnotations\r\nmvn -pl dubbo-common edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetMetaAnnotations\r\n```\r\nAfter checking the testlogs https://github.com/alany9552/flakyreport/blob/master/testgetmetaAnnotations.log, The tests fail due to the **non-deterministic results** produced by `getDeclaredAnnotations()` method. In this method, it calls the `getDeclaredAnnotations()` method imported form the `java.lang.annotation.Annotation` library, which produces a **non-deterministic** results for each run, which fails the original tests testing the order.  It seems that it starts to be non-deterministic already when getting the annotations, so it would be better to change the test files, to test if the returned list from `getDeclaredAnnotations()` contains the annotations that we want. After changing it, both tests pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nIn `testGetAllMetaAnnotations()` and `testGetMetaAnnotations()`, change the testing logic using `HashSet` to see if the results contains the desired value.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [X] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [X] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-09T03:06:42Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T12:18:57Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T12:18:57Z","merged_at":"2021-11-18T12:18:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"837fb4ad2a665c3c0ed8ace04fd931f57c943531","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c375ab15287fd4d324d85f145803e6ace06133a5","head":{"label":"alany9552:fixthreeflakytests","ref":"fixthreeflakytests","sha":"c375ab15287fd4d324d85f145803e6ace06133a5","user":{"login":"alany9552","id":71161910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTYxOTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71161910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552","html_url":"https://github.com/alany9552","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":423046448,"node_id":"R_kgDOGTctMA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"alany9552/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alany9552","id":71161910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTYxOTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71161910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552","html_url":"https://github.com/alany9552","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alany9552/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alany9552/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-06T06:18:22Z","updated_at":"2021-11-06T07:09:56Z","closed_at":"2021-11-06T07:09:56Z","merged_at":"2021-11-06T07:09:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"942ba9f4ffc1b1ee11552717d230dfdcd953a475","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/552fcc4f6ec52a3a6989240c868fdd847da57aca","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1106_pre_allocate","ref":"1106_pre_allocate","sha":"552fcc4f6ec52a3a6989240c868fdd847da57aca","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-06T06:14:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-06T07:35:17Z","closed_at":"2021-11-06T07:35:17Z","merged_at":"2021-11-06T07:35:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"335bf5ae52ce08d89582b703c0e64a83778d4d4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/218892ed7aa109b7b71dbf402ec550f04452a215","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1106_cache_extension","ref":"1106_cache_extension","sha":"218892ed7aa109b7b71dbf402ec550f04452a215","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-04T07:45:35Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T07:45:40Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T07:45:40Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T07:45:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5fc78fc9ff2b7a71c6a3e0387b84db3b94792f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9205/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9205/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9205/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/44b77199614c89bb55fc43f1b1a712ebe0ccad48","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1104_add_get_invokers_support","ref":"1104_add_get_invokers_support","sha":"44b77199614c89bb55fc43f1b1a712ebe0ccad48","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-03T13:17:28Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T07:48:38Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T07:48:38Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T07:48:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba173fdc5fe7ca6b8bd17809776e76d5b74324a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9201/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9201/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9201/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4eb19c5de6524bf9351521e5c18a1369bae3b30e","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1103_lazy_init_attributes","ref":"1103_lazy_init_attributes","sha":"4eb19c5de6524bf9351521e5c18a1369bae3b30e","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-03T08:24:44Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T01:42:48Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T01:42:48Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T01:42:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"eaf2b3d9fe44ad2966caad3dbe1dc5a3406700d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9198/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9198/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9198/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5beeb37b3fa5993299d0f875771cf162e51ececa","head":{"label":"guohao:fix-triple-state","ref":"fix-triple-state","sha":"5beeb37b3fa5993299d0f875771cf162e51ececa","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

#9150\r\nFix ExtensionLoader can not inject by type properly\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nLet ExtensionLoader support inject by type.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. To add @Inject annotation replaces with the less generic and convenient @DisableInject annotation.\r\n2. The method injectExtension of ExtensionLoader can inject by type now.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nExtensionLoader can inject by type,  for instance, custom filter has setter method and inject \r\ndependencies by type via annotation it with @Inject(type = ByType).\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nSupport upper-case method for native grpc client\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-02T03:05:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-02T03:50:34Z","closed_at":"2021-11-02T03:50:34Z","merged_at":"2021-11-02T03:50:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c7ee6296095dd043548e7660b8a362a327bf8c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8ac85fa7b19d96db31bcdbe0a95847baa5c9d44e","head":{"label":"guohao:add-upper-method","ref":"add-upper-method","sha":"8ac85fa7b19d96db31bcdbe0a95847baa5c9d44e","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-01T11:01:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T08:57:53Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T08:57:53Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T08:57:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"5dcf5754390bcb9a74e6c9be20b7bd7d63cb28c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/076011f94020fe6447cb0190becb23a724a286fe","head":{"label":"gkorland:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"076011f94020fe6447cb0190becb23a724a286fe","user":{"login":"gkorland","id":753206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland","html_url":"https://github.com/gkorland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":368453891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjg0NTM4OTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gkorland/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gkorland","id":753206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzIwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland","html_url":"https://github.com/gkorland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gkorland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gkorland/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6207\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-01T08:41:21Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T06:42:27Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T06:39:14Z","merged_at":"2021-12-16T06:39:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"dee5181645036f3bbaca9cc9492e9ccd3c2b700e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/48","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/48","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/48/labels","id":7475174,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Acg_m","number":48,"title":"3.0.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-10T07:41:35Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T02:51:43Z","due_on":"2022-01-31T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T02:51:43Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ceb8667f11cdb54f59f97e3ae256694df7aec044","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/setBytes","ref":"fix/setBytes","sha":"ceb8667f11cdb54f59f97e3ae256694df7aec044","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-31T16:10:11Z","updated_at":"2021-11-03T03:00:47Z","closed_at":"2021-11-03T02:59:39Z","merged_at":"2021-11-03T02:59:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa245c7a1a9bd68fa76e7033a7ae8595b269fdaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/47","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47/labels","id":7266430,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbuB-","number":47,"title":"3.0.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":62,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T06:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z","due_on":"2021-12-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9170/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9170/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9170/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d6fd56fff41a30f0418a5af5f50cda21a16dea82","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/authority","ref":"fix/authority","sha":"d6fd56fff41a30f0418a5af5f50cda21a16dea82","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-30T00:10:50Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T03:44:19Z","closed_at":"2021-10-30T02:28:50Z","merged_at":"2021-10-30T02:28:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"2841c9d6d17252a426f07daeff5a468946f897c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/47","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47/labels","id":7266430,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbuB-","number":47,"title":"3.0.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":62,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T06:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z","due_on":"2021-12-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1b650a6f7168bad93245555203126689e90c02b9","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/staItem_concurrency","ref":"fix/staItem_concurrency","sha":"1b650a6f7168bad93245555203126689e90c02b9","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-29T13:31:53Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T13:32:14Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T13:32:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d52dd47682a19b7d644c5be1a9b17e0a16f621e5","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d52dd47682a19b7d644c5be1a9b17e0a16f621e5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-29T08:01:12Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T03:45:09Z","closed_at":"2021-10-30T02:23:43Z","merged_at":"2021-10-30T02:23:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"db0f9b9a21cee65404bce35a871d94c2d0fb03e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/47","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47/labels","id":7266430,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbuB-","number":47,"title":"3.0.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":62,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T06:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z","due_on":"2021-12-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2c96f93a123bc4963f77cf4ae95d37210622f725","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feature/support_tps_method_level","ref":"feature/support_tps_method_level","sha":"2c96f93a123bc4963f77cf4ae95d37210622f725","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/9139\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-27T07:05:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-28T04:29:14Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T08:19:31Z","merged_at":"2021-10-27T08:19:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"65882a0f914033c3d2481bb76597a2b691dd05de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/47","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/47/labels","id":7266430,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AbuB-","number":47,"title":"3.0.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":62,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-19T06:11:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z","due_on":"2021-12-01T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-27T02:18:23Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/10f87b326922a350ad122a4090ea0c777641cb6d","head":{"label":"EarthChen:bugfix/9139","ref":"bugfix/9139","sha":"10f87b326922a350ad122a4090ea0c777641cb6d","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"448da6ea8696d8c73cc2b83dfd5401bd83cc3b06","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsee #9137 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nSupport the global registry center in unit tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. Remove all imported zookeeper instances\r\n2. Implementation the started and finished event to manange zookeeper instance when run unit tests\r\n3. Filter unnecessary package name to avoid to start and stop zookeeper instances in unit tests\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe test `org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetAllDeclaredAnnotations` is flaky. If run with different random seeds it will fail occasionally.\r\nThe root cause of it is due to an ordering bug in `java.lang.reflect` package. The function `getDeclaredAnnotation` does not have persistent order when calling each time.\r\nThis fix is mainly to mute the acknowledge the existence of the ordering issue and mute the bug in test case.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nRewrite the testcase in a different manner.\r\nThe new testcase is not assuming a fixed order of `annotations`. Instead it dynamically tries to match the types.\r\nThe previous test fails here because the wrong order of `annotations` may lead to an impossible conversion.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n`mvn -pl dubbo-common edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetAllDeclaredAnnotations`\r\n\r\n`mvn -pl dubbo-common edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -DnondexRuns=NUMBER -Dtest=org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.AnnotationUtilsTest#testGetAllDeclaredAnnotations`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-25T07:20:53Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T09:03:21Z","closed_at":"2021-11-04T09:03:21Z","merged_at":"2021-11-04T09:03:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"295f2a767f1a2dd812e955bff8c5efb0eb97fd3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/848db5b9212c05f4f7a80e54172e3f4e4ef0ef15","head":{"label":"HildoYe:fix-flaky","ref":"fix-flaky","sha":"848db5b9212c05f4f7a80e54172e3f4e4ef0ef15","user":{"login":"HildoYe","id":75227781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjI3Nzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75227781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe","html_url":"https://github.com/HildoYe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":420888117,"node_id":"R_kgDOGRY-NQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"HildoYe/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HildoYe","id":75227781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjI3Nzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75227781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe","html_url":"https://github.com/HildoYe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HildoYe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HildoYe/dubbo","description":"Apache

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-25T04:09:12Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T05:03:09Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T05:03:09Z","merged_at":"2021-10-25T05:03:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"0321a8fa41ed37d895595d9d627eefa1e22b74fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/372ace4a29d71917a9c8f0fc04fd3e508edbbe60","head":{"label":"haoyann:fix-multiple-registry","ref":"fix-multiple-registry","sha":"372ace4a29d71917a9c8f0fc04fd3e508edbbe60","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-24T13:28:08Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T14:39:16Z","closed_at":"2021-10-24T13:56:39Z","merged_at":"2021-10-24T13:56:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9b50dbcdad5bd424a7132af5023fdbd8f646e84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5a5e3f3fd7d0482b6124bd5b52b10f4900856438","head":{"label":"apache:3.0.4-release","ref":"3.0.4-release","sha":"5a5e3f3fd7d0482b6124bd5b52b10f4900856438","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-24T00:56:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T07:37:24Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T04:38:33Z","merged_at":"2021-10-25T04:38:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"18e8645d8301f110b2ab33f9fef1a0289578c567","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9108/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9108/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9108/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/142417d928dda1ae0a59f0f65d862b8211260403","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/monitor_npe","ref":"fix/monitor_npe","sha":"142417d928dda1ae0a59f0f65d862b8211260403","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.
