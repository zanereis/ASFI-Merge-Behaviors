for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis switches Spark to use shaded Hadoop clients, namely hadoop-client-api and hadoop-client-runtime, for Hadoop 3.x. For Hadoop 2.7, we'll still use the same modules such as hadoop-client.\r\n\r\nIn order to still keep default Hadoop profile to be hadoop-3.2, this defines the following Maven properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhadoop-client-api.artifact\r\nhadoop-client-runtime.artifact\r\nhadoop-client-minicluster.artifact\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich default to:\r\n```\r\nhadoop-client-api\r\nhadoop-client-runtime\r\nhadoop-client-minicluster\r\n```\r\nbut all switch to `hadoop-client` when the Hadoop profile is hadoop-2.7. A side affect from this is we'll import the same dependency multiple times. For this I have to disable Maven enforcer `banDuplicatePomDependencyVersions`.\r\n\r\nBesides above, there are the following changes:\r\n- explicitly add a few dependencies which are imported via transitive dependencies from Hadoop jars, but are removed from the shaded client jars.\r\n- removed the use of `ProxyUriUtils.getPath` from `ApplicationMaster` which is a server-side/private API.\r\n- modified `IsolatedClientLoader` to exclude `hadoop-auth` jars when Hadoop version is 3.x. This change should only matter when we're not sharing Hadoop classes with Spark (which is _mostly_ used in tests).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis serves two purposes:\r\n- to unblock Spark from upgrading to Hadoop 3.2.2/3.3.0+. Latest Hadoop versions have upgraded to use Guava 27+ and in order to adopt the latest Hadoop versions in Spark, we'll need to resolve the Guava conflicts. This takes the approach by switching to shaded client jars provided by Hadoop.\r\n- avoid pulling 3rd party dependencies from Hadoop and avoid potential future conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen people use Spark with `hadoop-provided` option, they should make sure class path contains `hadoop-client-api` and `hadoop-client-runtime` jars. In addition, they may need to make sure these jars appear before other Hadoop jars in the order. Otherwise, classes may be loaded from the other non-shaded Hadoop jars and cause potential conflicts.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe UT for SPARK-32019 (#28853) tries to write about 16GB of data do the disk. We must change the value of `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` to a smaller value do check the correct behavior with less data. By default it is `128MB`.\r\nThe other parameters in this UT are also changed to smaller values to keep the behavior the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe runtime of this one UT can be over 7 minutes on Jenkins. After the change it is few seconds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace current examples for `percentile_approx()` with **only one** input value by example **with multiple values** in the input column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent examples are pretty trivial, and don't demonstrate function's behaviour on a sequence of values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- by running `ExpressionInfoSuite`\r\n-

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29475.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the code to broadcast the Array instead of Set, which was the behavior before #29475\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe size of Set can be much bigger than Array. It's safer to keep the behavior the same as before and build the set at the executor side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29475.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the code to broadcast the Array instead of Set, which was the behavior before #29475\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe size of Set can be much bigger than Array. It's safer to keep the behavior the same as before and build the set at the executor side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is only one failed case of `streaming` module in Scala 2.13: `start with non-serializable DStream checkpoint ` in `StreamingContextSuite`. \r\n\r\n`StackOverflowError` is thrown here when `SerializationDebugger#visit` method is called. \r\n\r\nI found that `inputStreams` and `outputStreams` in `DStreamGraph` can not be matched in `SerializationDebugger#visit` method because `ArrayBuffer` in not `Array` in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr is use `mutable.ArraySeq` instead of `ArrayBuffer` to store `inputStreams` and `outputStreams` in `DStreamGraph`, then it can be matched in `SerializationDebugger#visit` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix [SPARK-32886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-32886) in branch-2.4. i cherry-pick [29757](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29757) and partial [28690](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28690)(test part is ignored as conflict), which PR `29757` has dependency on PR `28690`. This change fixes two below issues in branch-2.4. \r\n[SPARK-31882: DAG-viz is not rendered correctly with pagination.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-31882)\r\n[SPARK-32886: '.../jobs/undefined' link from \"Event Timeline\" in jobs page](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-32886)\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n@sarutak found `29757` has dependency on `28690`. If we only merge `29757` to 2.4 branch, it would cause UI break. And I verified both issues mentioned in [SPARK-32886](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-32886) and [SPARK-31882](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-31882)  exist in branch-2.4. So i cherry pick them to branch 2.4 in same PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested.\r\n![dag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/93854440-9c770480-fc6a-11ea-9009-0ee68ef090e1.JPG)\r\n![eventTLJPG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/93854447-a13bb880-fc6a-11ea-9b34-73623fa59def.JPG)\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-22T07:33:46Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T13:35:18Z","closed_at":"2020-09-25T13:35:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72a03c7b59bafd9258d76bb76cba5a748d253509","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOnly calculate the executorRunTime when taskStartTime > 0. Otherwise, set executorRunTime to 0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbug fix.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that a task be killed (e.g., by another successful attempt) before it reaches \"taskStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\". In this case, taskStartTime is still 0 since it hasn't been really initialized. And we will get the wrong executorRunTime by calculating System.currentTimeMillis() - taskStartTime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users will see the correct executorRunTime.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.","created_at":"2020-09-22T06:04:03Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T06:20:38Z","closed_at":"2020-09-22T06:20:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9a16a4f36ba356d7d2fdeed11e37cded3778bf7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29832/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29832/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29832/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0fda02d8a9e7f3fbb7bc7e2c5331478cf144193","head":{"label":"Ngone51:backport-spark-3289","ref":"backport-spark-3289","sha":"c0fda02d8a9e7f3fbb7bc7e2c5331478cf144193","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, actual non-dynamic partition pruning is executed in the optimizer phase (PruneFileSourcePartitions) if an input relation has a catalog file index. The current code assumes the same partition filters are generated again in FileSourceStrategy and passed into FileSourceScanExec. FileSourceScanExec uses the partition filters when listing files, but these non-dynamic partition filters do nothing because unnecessary partitions are already pruned in advance, so the filters are mainly used for explain output in this case. If a WHERE clause has DNF-ed predicates, FileSourceStrategy cannot extract the same filters with PruneFileSourcePartitions and then PartitionFilters is not shown in explain output.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to extract partition filters in FileSourceStrategy and HiveStrategy with `extractPredicatesWithinOutputSet` added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29101/files#diff-6be42cfa3c62a7536b1eb1d6447c073c again, then It will show the partially pushed down partition filter in explain().\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nwithout the patch, the explained plan is inconsistent with what is actually executed \r\n\r\n<b>without the change </b> the explained plan of `\"SELECT * FROM t WHERE p = '1' OR (p = '2' AND i = 1)\"` for datasource and hive tables are like the following respectively (missing pushed down partition filters)\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Filter ((p#21 = 1) OR ((p#21 = 2)

Physical Plan ==\r\n   *(1) Filter ((p#33 = 1) OR ((p#33 = 2) AND (i#32 = 1)))\r\n   +- Scan hive default.t [i#32, p#33], HiveTableRelation [`default`.`t`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, Data Cols: [i#32], Partition Cols: [p#33], Pruned Partitions: [(p=1), (p=2)]] \r\n```\r\n\r\n<b> with change </b> the  plan looks like (the actually executed partition filters are exhibited)\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Filter ((p#21 = 1) OR ((p#21 = 2) AND (i#20 = 1)))\r\n+- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n   +- FileScan parquet

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds additional check on temp view in prior to loadTable in DataFrameWriterV2, and fail-fast with better exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR would provide better exception and its message - see below section.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes - previously using temp view in DataFrameWriterV2 throws NoSuchTableException without any information on temp view. Now it throws AnalysisException with exception message that it's a temporary view which doesn't support write operations in DataFrameWriterV2.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to verify that the `resource-managers/yarn` module passed all UTs in Scala 2.13 , I found that there is a \r\nissue related to classpath order maybe blocked the UTs because there are more than one `servlet-api` dependency in spark now:\r\n\r\n- One is `javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.10:compile` config in core/pom.xml,\r\n\r\n- The other is `jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:4.0.3:test`  cascaded by `org.glassfish.jersey.test-framework.providers`\r\n\r\nwe can use `mvn dependency:tree` to check it .\r\n\r\nSo when we execute `resource-managers/yarn` module test use\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean test -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn \r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\nmvn clean test -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Pscala-2.13\r\n```\r\n\r\nand if the position of `javax.servlet-api` in the  in classpath is before `jakarta.servlet-api`, there are some cases failed in `YarnClusterSuite`, `YarnShuffleIntegrationSuite`  and `YarnShuffleAuthSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe failed reason as follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/09/18 19:14:07.486 launcher-proc-1 INFO YarnClusterDriver: Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\r\n...\r\n20/09/18 19:14:07.486 launcher-proc-1 INFO YarnClusterDriver: Caused by: java.lang.SecurityException: class \"javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionIdListener\"'s signer information does not match signer information of other classes in the same package\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid UTs error caused by classpath order .\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: Pass 2.13 Build GitHub Action and do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Pscala-2.13 -am\r\nmvn clean test -pl resource-managers/yarn -Pyarn -Pscala-2.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTests: succeeded 136, failed 0, canceled 1, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAllow to run the Spark web UI behind a reverse proxy with URLs prefixed by a context root, like www.mydomain.com/spark. In particular, this allows to access multiple Spark clusters through the same virtual host, only distinguishing them by context root, like www.mydomain.com/cluster1, www.mydomain.com/cluster2, and it allows to run the Spark UI in a common cookie domain (for SSO) with other services.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to take over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17455.\r\nAfter changes, Spark allows showing customized prefix URL in all the `href` links of the HTML pages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, all the links of UI pages will be contains the value of `spark.ui.reverseProxyUrl` if it is configurated.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew HTML Unit tests in MasterSuite\r\nManual UI testing for master, worker and app UI with an nginx proxy\r\nSpark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncrease size of socket receive buffer in these tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe socket receive buffer size set in this test was too small for\r\nthe StatsdSinkSuite tests to run reliably on some systems. For a\r\ntest in this suite to run reliably the buffer needs to be large\r\nenough to hold all the data in the packets being sent in a test\r\nalong with any additional kernel or protocol overhead. The amount\r\nof kernel overhead per packet can vary from system to system but is\r\ntypically far higher than the protocol overhead.\r\n\r\nIf the receive buffer is too small and fills up then packets are\r\nsilently dropped. This leads to the test failing with a timeout.\r\n\r\nIf the socket defaults to a larger receive buffer (normally true)\r\nthen we should keep that size.\r\n\r\nAs well as increasing the minimum buffer size I've also decoupled\r\nthe datagram packet buffer size from the receive buffer size. The\r\nreceive buffer should in general be far larger to account for the\r\nfact that multiple packets might be buffered, as well as the\r\naforementioned overhead. Any truncated data in individual packets\r\nwill be picked up by the tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this only affects the tests.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests on IBM Z and x86.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-21T14:25:37Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T12:45:17Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T13:31:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f9dc001d911489475256ee0561a2cd1ee0c56f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9181c18aa05d50f784ffb9025d65f46561e9db42","head":{"label":"linux-on-ibm-z:fix-statsd","ref":"fix-statsd","sha":"9181c18aa05d50f784ffb9025d65f46561e9db42","user":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42882114,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjg4MjExNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"linux-on-ibm-z/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/spark","description":"Mirror

Arrow has a \"self-destruct\" mode now (Arrow >= 0.16) to avoid this, by freeing each column after conversion. This PR integrates support for this in toPandas, handling a couple of edge cases: \r\n\r\nself_destruct has no effect unless the memory is allocated appropriately, which is handled in the Arrow serializer here. Essentially, the issue is that self_destruct frees memory column-wise, but Arrow record batches are oriented row-wise:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRecord batch 0: allocation 0: column 0 chunk 0, column 1 chunk 0, ...\r\nRecord batch 1: allocation 1: column 0 chunk 1, column 1 chunk 1, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, Arrow will drop references to all of column 0's chunks, but no memory will actually be freed, as the chunks were just slices of an underlying allocation. The PR copies each column into its own allocation so that memory is instead arranged as so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRecord batch 0: allocation 0 column 0 chunk 0, allocation 1 column 1 chunk 0, ...\r\nRecord batch 1: allocation 2 column 0 chunk 1, allocation 3 column 1 chunk 1, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe optimization is disabled by default, and can be enabled with the Spark SQL conf \"spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.selfDestruct.enabled\" set to \"true\". We can't always apply this optimization because it's more likely to generate a dataframe with immutable buffers, which Pandas doesn't always handle well, and because it is slower overall (since it only converts one column at a time instead of in parallel).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis lets us load larger datasets - in particular, with N bytes of memory, before we could never load a dataset bigger than N/2 bytes; now the overhead is more like N/1.25 or so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes - it adds a new SQL conf \"spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.selfDestruct.enabled\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSee the [mailing list](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Reducing-memory-usage-of-toPandas-with-Arrow-quot-self-destruct-quot-option-td30149.html) - it was tested with Python memory_profiler. Unit tests added to check memory within certain bounds and correctness with the option enabled.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-21T13:30:13Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T18:01:38Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T17:59:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8394ddcf028f2d81bd7d0d15689a7648b6d1400","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/64d03012616c9bc56b97693d1fdf8132493deb0e","head":{"label":"lidavidm:spark-32953","ref":"spark-32953","sha":"64d03012616c9bc56b97693d1fdf8132493deb0e","user":{"login":"lidavidm","id":327919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/327919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm","html_url":"https://github.com/lidavidm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297345247,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTczNDUyNDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"lidavidm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lidavidm","id":327919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/327919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm","html_url":"https://github.com/lidavidm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lidavidm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lidavidm/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the RPC message flow among the multiple decommission use cases, it includes changes:\r\n\r\n* Keep `Worker`'s decommission status be consistent between the case where decommission starts from `Worker` and the case where decommission starts from the `MasterWebUI`: sending `DecommissionWorker` from `Master` to `Worker` in the latter case.\r\n\r\n* Change from two-way communication to one-way communication when notifying decommission between driver and executor: it's obviously unnecessary for the executor to acknowledge the decommission status to the driver since the decommission request is from the driver. And it's same in reverse.\r\n\r\n* Only send one message instead of two(`DecommissionSelf`/`DecommissionBlockManager`) when decommission the executor: executor and `BlockManager` are in the same JVM.\r\n\r\n* Clean up codes around here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1948\" alt=\"WeChat56c00cc34d9785a67a544dca036d49da\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/92850308-dc461c80-f41e-11ea-8ac0-287825f4e0c4.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1968\" alt=\"WeChat05f7afb017e3f0132394c5e54245e49e\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/93189571-de88dd80-f774-11ea-9300-1943920aa27d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Note the diagrams only counts those RPC calls that needed to go through the network.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add more optimization to `UpdateFields` expression chain. And optimize `UpdateFields` early in analysis phase.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this optimization includes:\r\n\r\n* Deduplicates `WithField` at `UpdateFields`\r\n* In `SimplifyExtractValueOps`, respect nullability in input struct at `GetStructField(UpdateFields(struct, ...))`, and unwrap if-else.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`UpdateFields` can manipulate complex nested data, but using `UpdateFields` can easily create inefficient expression chain. We should optimize it further.\r\n\r\nBecause when manipulating deeply nested schema, the `UpdateFields` expression tree could be too complex to analyze, this change optimizes `UpdateFields` early in analysis phase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR addresses two issues related to the `Relation: view text` test in `DataSourceV2SQLSuite`.\r\n\r\n1. The test has the following block:\r\n```scala\r\nwithView(\"view1\") { v1: String =>\r\n  sql(...)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSince `withView`'s signature is `withView(v: String*)(f: => Unit): Unit`, the `f` that will be executed is ` v1: String => sql(..)`, which is just defining the anonymous function, and _not_ executing it.\r\n\r\n2. Once the test is fixed to run, it actually fails. The reason is that the v2 session catalog implementation used in tests does not correctly handle `V1Table` for views in `loadTable`. And this results in views resolved to `ResolvedTable` instead of `ResolvedView`, causing the test failure: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f1dc479d39a6f05df7155008d8ec26dff42bb06c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L1007-L1011\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFixing a bug in test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCollect, first and last have mistakenly been marked as non-deterministic. They are actually deterministic iff their child expression is deterministic.\r\n\r\nFor example collect was marked as non-deterministic in #14749. The reasoning was that its output depends on the actual order of input rows. Although it is correct that these aggregators depend on the order of input rows, it does not make them non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nIn `EliminateSorts` optimizer rule, there is a method `isOrderIrrelevantAggs`, that lists all aggregators that do not depend on their input row order. Collect, first and last are correctly not listed there. \r\nAn aggregator would be non-deterministic if its output for a group would depend on previous groups it has aggregated - I can't think of any practical examples of this kind of aggregator in Spark.\r\n\r\nAn analogous aggregator to these would be sum on float and double datatype  - its result does depend on the order of its inputs, but is deterministic. Another similar aggregates are the `max_by` and `min_by` - deterministic functions, that can return different results when the order of rows changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe optimizer rule `PushPredicateThroughNonJoin` can work in more cases. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

the worker registration after Spark failover the following race condition may occur:\r\n\r\n(1) Master A fails and Worker attempts to reconnect to all masters\r\n(2) Master B takes over and notifies Worker\r\n(3) Worker responds by registering with Master B\r\n(4) Meanwhile, Worker's previous reconnection attempt reaches Master B, causing the same Worker to register with Master B twice\r\n\r\nThis race condition was already once fixed in [SPARK-4592](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4592), but the very first connection retry was forgotten: right after the worker was losing connection to the master it was first trying to connect to both masters (usually this first request times out, because in general failover takes 10-15 seconds and many people almost never notice this problem). After the first try worker was continuing to try to reregister only with the last known master.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIf there was an active master before, never try to reregister with both masters.\r\n`reregisterWithMaster` function is smart to understand if it is a failover scenario and worker was already registered with some\r\nmaster or if it is the very first try and registration should be tried with both masters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf failover happens relatively fast, then `Duplicate worker ID` error may happen and worker gets killed. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThis bug has a lot of concurrency and timing issues, but can be stably reproduced with the following steps:\r\n1. To make failover really fast changes from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26598 can be used\r\n2. Start several contexts\r\n3. Without the patch during failover some workers will always get

PR is created just for reference which will not be merged. There will be smaller PRs for all the subtasks under [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is for Push-based shuffle. \r\n- [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602)\r\n- [SPIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mYzKVZllA5Flw8AtoX7JUcXBOnNIDADWRbJ7GI6Y71Q/)\r\n- [VLDB paper](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13010327/vldb_magnet_final.pdf)\r\n- [Mailing List Discussion](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Enabling-push-based-shuffle-in-Spark-td28732.html)\r\n\r\nA summary of push-based shuffle:\r\n- Shuffle Map Tasks push small shuffle blocks to remote shuffle services.\r\n- Remote shuffle services merge the small shuffle blocks into larger merged blocks.\r\n- Driver coordinates the merge finalization and collects merge statuses from the shuffle services.\r\n- Reducers read/fetch the merged blocks in chunks. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPush-based shuffle aims to improve the overall efficiency, reliability, and scalability of the shuffle operation. More details are in the VLDB paper and the SPIP document.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This introduces a new push-merge shuffle mechanism. Push-based shuffle can be turned on by a configuration `spark.shuffle.push.based.enabled`. There are additional configurations added. We will describe these configurations in the PRs for the individual sub-tasks.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested by running different shuffle intensive workloads as well as TPCH queries. The results are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q5m7YAp0HyG_TNFL4p_bjQgzzw33ik5i49Vr86UNZgg/edit#).\r\n\r\n### Pending tasks\r\nThese are the tasks that are not yet covered by this change. As and when these changes are handled with the subtasks, we will update this PR.\r\n- [ ] Move the merge finalize timeouts behind an interface. The default implementation will use a static timeout.\r\n- [ ] Minimize/eliminate changes to DAGScheduler and TaskSetManager.\r\n- [ ] Move selecting merger nodes behind an interface.\r\n- [ ] Minimize changes to MapOutputTracker. \r\n- [ ] Minimize changes to ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.\r\n\r\n### Gaps\r\nThese are the tasks that will not be covered by this change. \r\n- Node Manager work preserving restarts.\r\n- Metrics related to push-based

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add support to decide bucketed table scan dynamically based on actual query plan. Currently bucketing is enabled by default (`spark.sql.sources.bucketing.enabled`=true), so for all bucketed tables in the query plan, we will use bucket table scan (all input files per the bucket will be read by same task). This has the drawback that if the bucket table scan is not benefitting at all (no join/groupby/etc in the query), we don't need to use bucket table scan as it would restrict the # of tasks to be # of buckets and might hurt parallelism.\r\n\r\nThe feature is to add a physical plan rule right after `EnsureRequirements`:\r\n\r\nThe rule goes through plan nodes. For all operators which has \"interesting partition\" (i.e., require `ClusteredDistribution` or `HashClusteredDistribution`), check if the sub-plan for operator has `Exchange` and bucketed table scan (and only allow certain operators in plan (i.e. `Scan/Filter/Project/Sort/PartialAgg/etc`.), see details in `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScan.disableBucketWithInterestingPartition`). If yes, disable the bucketed table scan in the sub-plan. In addition, disabling bucketed table scan if there's operator with interesting partition along the sub-plan.\r\n\r\nWhy the algorithm works is that if there's a shuffle between the bucketed table scan and operator with interesting partition, then bucketed table scan partitioning will be destroyed by the shuffle operator in the middle, and we don't need bucketed table scan for sure.\r\n\r\nThe idea of \"interesting partition\" is inspired from \"interesting order\" in \"Access Path Selection in a Relational Database Management System\"(http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/adbs/AccessPath.pdf), after discussion with @cloud-fan .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid unnecessary bucketed scan in the query, and this is prerequisite for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29625 (decide bucketed sorted scan dynamically will be added later in that PR).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nA new config `spark.sql.sources.bucketing.autoBucketedScan.enabled` is introduced which set to false by default (the rule is disabled by default as it can regress cached bucketed table query, see discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29804#issuecomment-701151447). User can opt-in/opt-out by enabling/disabling the config, as we found in prod, some users rely on assumption of # of tasks == # of buckets when reading bucket table to precisely control # of tasks. This is a bad assumption but it does happen on our side, so leave a config here to allow them opt-out for the feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr fix all 14 failed cases in `external/avro` module in Scala 2.13, the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Manual call `toSeq` in `AvroDeserializer#newWriter` and `SchemaConverters#toSqlTypeHelper` method because the object  type for case match is `ArrayBuffer` not `Seq` in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n- Specified `Seq` to `s.c.Seq` when we call `Row.get(i).asInstanceOf[Seq]` because the data maybe `mutable.ArraySeq` but `Seq` is `immutable.Seq` in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: Pass 2.13

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark SQL supports some window function like `NTH_VALUE`.\r\nIf we specify window frame like `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` or `UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`, we can elimate some calculations.\r\nFor example: if we execute the SQL show below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT NTH_VALUE(col,\r\n         2) OVER(ORDER BY rank UNBOUNDED PRECEDING\r\n        AND CURRENT ROW)\r\nFROM tab;\r\n```\r\nThe output for row number greater than 1, return the fixed value. otherwise, return null. So we just calculate the value once and notice whether the row number less than 2.\r\n`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` is simpler.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the performance for `NTH_VALUE`, `FIRST_VALUE` and `LAST_VALUE`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n 'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-18T07:50:47Z","updated_at":"2020-10-28T07:13:03Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T06:40:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f589ffdb86f4c9fde57ec111dd94cd3fd3078b01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c0e82ba0ab95af7871b4b16f8be1e0662d49c78","head":{"label":"beliefer:optimize-nth_value","ref":"optimize-nth_value","sha":"1c0e82ba0ab95af7871b4b16f8be1e0662d49c78","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

For justification see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29591#discussion_r489402579\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now it is not clear that `keyword_only` methods are indeed keyword only. This proposal addresses that.\r\n\r\nIn practice we could probably capture `locals` and drop `keyword_only` completel, i.e:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@keyword_only\r\ndef __init__(self, *, featuresCol=\"features\"):\r\n    ...\r\n    kwargs = self._input_kwargs\r\n    self.setParams(**kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould be replaced with\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef __init__(self, *, featuresCol=\"features\"):\r\n    kwargs = locals()\r\n    del kwargs[\"self\"]\r\n    ...\r\n    self.setParams(**kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDocstrings and inspect tools will now indicate that `keyword_only` methods expect only keyword arguments.\r\n\r\nFor example with ` LinearSVC` will change from\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.ml.classification import LinearSVC                                                                                                                                                                \r\n>>> ?LinearSVC.__init__                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\nSignature:\r\nLinearSVC.__init__(\r\n    self,\r\n    featuresCol='features',\r\n    labelCol='label',\r\n    predictionCol='prediction',\r\n    maxIter=100,\r\n    regParam=0.0,\r\n    tol=1e-06,\r\n    rawPredictionCol='rawPrediction',\r\n    fitIntercept=True,\r\n    standardization=True,\r\n    threshold=0.0,\r\n    weightCol=None,\r\n    aggregationDepth=2,\r\n)\r\nDocstring: __init__(self, featuresCol=\"features\", labelCol=\"label\", predictionCol=\"prediction\",                  maxIter=100, regParam=0.0, tol=1e-6, rawPredictionCol=\"rawPrediction\",                  fitIntercept=True, standardization=True, threshold=0.0, weightCol=None,                  aggregationDepth=2):\r\nFile:      /path/to/python/pyspark/ml/classification.py\r\nType:      function\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from pyspark.ml.classification import LinearSVC                                                                                                                                     \r\n>>> ?LinearSVC.__init__                                                                                                                                                                 \r\nSignature:\r\nLinearSVC.__init__   (\r\n    self,\r\n    *,\r\n    featuresCol='features',\r\n    labelCol='label',\r\n    predictionCol='prediction',\r\n    maxIter=100,\r\n    regParam=0.0,\r\n    tol=1e-06,\r\n    rawPredictionCol='rawPrediction',\r\n    fitIntercept=True,\r\n    standardization=True,\r\n    threshold=0.0,\r\n    weightCol=None,\r\n    aggregationDepth=2,\r\n    blockSize=1,\r\n)\r\nDocstring: __init__(self, \\*, featuresCol=\"features\", labelCol=\"label\", predictionCol=\"prediction\",                  maxIter=100, regParam=0.0, tol=1e-6, rawPredictionCol=\"rawPrediction\",                  fitIntercept=True, standardization=True, threshold=0.0, weightCol=None,                  aggregationDepth=2, blockSize=1):\r\nFile:      ~/Workspace/spark/python/pyspark/ml/classification.py\r\nType:      function\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

repartition with partition column on dynamic partition overwrite. AQE could break it by removing physical shuffle with local shuffle reader.

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Refactored `WithFields` Expression to make it more extensible (now `UpdateFields`). \r\n2. Added a new `dropFields` method to the `Column` class. This method should allow users to drop a `StructField` in a `StructType` column (with similar semantics to the `drop` method on `Dataset`). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOften Spark users have to work with deeply nested data e.g. to fix a data quality issue with an existing `StructField`. To do this with the existing Spark APIs, users have to rebuild the entire struct column. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have the following deeply nested data structure which has a data quality issue (`5` is missing): \r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n\r\nval data = spark.createDataFrame(sc.parallelize(\r\n      Seq(Row(Row(Row(1, 2, 3), Row(Row(4, null, 6), Row(7, 8, 9), Row(10, 11, 12)), Row(13, 14, 15))))),\r\n      StructType(Seq(\r\n        StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n          StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n          StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))), \r\n            StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n          ))), \r\n          StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n        )))))).cache\r\n\r\ndata.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------+                                             \r\n|a                                |\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4,, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]|\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nCurrently, to drop the missing value users would have to do something like this: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", \r\n  struct(\r\n    $\"a.a\", \r\n    struct(\r\n      struct(\r\n        $\"a.b.a.a\", \r\n        $\"a.b.a.c\"\r\n      ).as(\"a\"), \r\n      $\"a.b.b\", \r\n      $\"a.b.c\"\r\n    ).as(\"b\"), \r\n    $\"a.c\"\r\n  ))\r\n\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nAs you can see above, with the existing methods users must call the `struct` function and list all fields, including fields they don't want to change. This is not ideal as: \r\n>this leads to complex, fragile code that cannot survive schema evolution. \r\n[SPARK-16483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16483)\r\n\r\nIn contrast, with the method added in this PR, a user could simply do something like this to get the same result: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", 'a.dropFields(\"b.a.b\"))\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the second of maybe 3 methods that could be added to the `Column` class to make it easier to manipulate nested data. \r\nOther methods under discussion in [SPARK-22231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22231) include `withFieldRenamed`. \r\nHowever, this should be added in a separate PR. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe documentation for `Column.withField` method has changed to include an additional note about how to write optimized queries when adding multiple nested Column directly. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests were added. Jenkins must pass them. \r\n\r\n### Related JIRAs: \r\nMore discussion on this topic can be found here: \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22231\r\n-

This extends it to support **numeric types** such as float/double/decimal, so that filters involving these types can be better pushed down to data sources.\r\n\r\nUnlike the cases of integral types, conversions between numeric types can result to rounding up or downs. Consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncast(e as double) < 1.9\r\n```\r\n\r\nassume type of `e` is short, since 1.9 is not representable in the type, the casting will either truncate or round. Now suppose the literal is truncated, we cannot convert the expression to:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ne < cast(1.9 as short)\r\n```\r\n\r\nas in the previous implementation, since if `e` is 1, the original expression evaluates to true, but converted expression will evaluate to false.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the above, this PR first finds out whether casting from the wider type to the narrower type will result to truncate or round, by comparing a _roundtrip value_ derived from **converting the literal first to the narrower type, and then to the wider type**, versus the original literal value. For instance, in the above, we'll first obtain a roundtrip value via the conversion (double) 1.9 -> (short) 1 -> (double) 1.0, and then compare it against 1.9. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1153\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-28 at 3 30 27 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506679/94492719-bd29e780-019f-11eb-9111-71d6e3d157f7.png\">\r\n                                   \r\nNow in the case of truncate, we'd convert the original expression to:\r\n```sql\r\ne <= cast(1.9 as short)\r\n```\r\ninstead, so that the conversion also is valid when `e` is 1.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please check [this blog post](https://prestosql.io/blog/2019/05/21/optimizing-the-casts-away.html) by Presto which offers a very good explanation on how it works.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor queries such as:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM tbl WHERE short_col < 100.5\r\n```\r\nThe predicate `short_col < 100.5` can't be pushed down to data sources because it involves casts. This eliminates the cast so these queries can run more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSome expression's data type not a static value. It needs to be constructed a new object when calling `dataType` function. E.g.: `CaseWhen`.\r\nWe should avoid constructing dataType multiple times because it may be used many times. E.g.: [`HyperLogLogPlusPlus.update`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/10edeafc69250afef8c71ed7b3c77992f67aa4ff/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/aggregate/HyperLogLogPlusPlus.scala#L122).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance. for example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(100000000L).selectExpr(\"approx_count_distinct(case when id % 400 > 20 then id else 0 end)\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\nProfiling result:\r\n```\r\n-- Execution profile ---\r\nTotal samples       : 18365\r\n\r\nFrame buffer usage  : 2.6688%\r\n\r\n--- 58443254327 ns (31.82%), 5844

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOnly calculate the executorRunTime when taskStartTimeNs > 0. Otherwise, set executorRunTime to 0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbug fix.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that a task be killed (e.g., by another successful attempt) before it reaches \"taskStartTimeNs = System.nanoTime()\". In this case, taskStartTimeNs is still 0 since it hasn't been really initialized. And we will get the wrong executorRunTime by calculating System.nanoTime() - taskStartTimeNs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users will see the correct executorRunTime.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.","created_at":"2020-09-17T15:33:00Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T05:49:56Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T21:02:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3d803139e427031ba502eba1670c04b06fc963b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1ef396289d7a952843a5ae5f246a1bee60ac056","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-SPARK-32898","ref":"fix-SPARK-32898","sha":"d1ef396289d7a952843a5ae5f246a1bee60ac056","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSplit `ExecutorDecommissionInfo` into 5 classes for different use cases:\r\n\r\n* `DynamicAllocationDecommission`: for the case where decommission is triggered at executor dynamic allocation\r\n\r\n* `StandaloneDecommission(workerHost)`: for the Standalone case\r\n\r\n* `K8SDecommission`: for the Kubernetes case, it extends `ExecutorTriggeredDecommission`.\r\n\r\n* `ExecutorTriggeredDecommission`: for the case where decommission is triggered at executor\r\n\r\n* `TestExecutorDecommission(host)`: test only.\r\n\r\nAnd all of them extend `ExecutorDecommissionReason` with a specific decommission reason.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `ExecutorDecommissionState` would accept the `ExecutorDecommissionReason` as an attribute and exposes common information by functions, e.g., `isHostDecommissioned()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have various decommission uses cases now. And `ExecutorDecommissionInfo` becomes not enough to distinguish the case where decommission is triggered at executor after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29722. That's also the reason why we added `triggeredByExecutor`. But things like `triggeredByExecutor` can be annoying and not easy to extend. So we need to improve the current way to work better with different cases.\r\n\r\nThere are a few benefits with this PR:\r\n\r\n* Get rid of the parameter `triggeredByExecutor`\r\n\r\n* No longer need to save the redundant `workerHost` info\r\n\r\n* The decommission handling logic is more clear than before\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWIP: I need to check whether k8s has an existing test covered by my change.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-17T15:01:53Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T01:10:27Z","closed_at":"2021-01-08T01:10:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f8308b9507a15f1b5409a6479a21d6bf3a7b9c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29788/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29788/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29788/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bebdd4f2846f12f8ab13279c8cece151e8edfd0","head":{"label":"Ngone51:impr-decom-info","ref":"impr-decom-info","sha":"9bebdd4f2846f12f8ab13279c8cece151e8edfd0","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator` to free its memory (except for the page holding the last record) if it is forced to spill after all of its records have been read. It also makes sure that `lastPage` is freed if `loadNext` is never called the again. The latter was necessary to get my test case to succeed (otherwise it would complain about a leak).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo memory is freed after calling `UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator.spill()` when all records have been read, even though it is still holding onto some memory. This may cause a `SparkOutOfMemoryError` to be thrown, even though we could have just freed the memory instead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test was added to `UnsafeExternalSorterSuite`.","created_at":"2020-09-17T14:57:25Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T11:50:12Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T11:50:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ac8e6ccbdc2e1511914bfd546146a1c8b50b8bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1728eb32621ee9fcf1c05fd4825f5bf2623bf2f0","head":{"label":"tomvanbussel:SPARK-32911","ref":"SPARK-32911","sha":"1728eb32621ee9fcf1c05fd4825f5bf2623bf2f0","user":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174318680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMTg2ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"tomvanbussel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Change the target error calculation according to the paper [Space-Efficient Online Computation of Quantile Summaries](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~datar/courses/cs361a/papers/quantiles.pdf). It says that the error `e = max(gi, deltai)/2` (see the page 59). Also this has clear explanation [ε-approximate quantiles](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/584/Syllabus/08-Quantile/Greenwald.html#proofprop1).\r\n2. Added a test to check different accuracies.\r\n3. Added an input CSV file `percentile_approx-input.csv.bz2` to the resource folder `sql/catalyst/src/main/resources` for the test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix incorrect percentile calculation, see an example in SPARK-32908.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By running existing tests in `QuantileSummariesSuite` and in `ApproximatePercentileQuerySuite`.\r\n- Added new test `SPARK-32908: maximum target error in percentile_approx` to `ApproximatePercentileQuerySuite`.","created_at":"2020-09-17T14:45:05Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:06Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T02:56:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad50789d04876a241591559711efea2da50a485f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06b44a99e809ff27aac5db2b77219b00cef0437c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-percentile_approx-2.4","ref":"fix-percentile_approx-2.4","sha":"06b44a99e809ff27aac5db2b77219b00cef0437c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `UnsafeExternalSorter` to no longer allocate any memory while spilling. In particular it removes the allocation of a new pointer array in `UnsafeInMemorySorter`. Instead the new pointer array is allocated whenever the next record is inserted into the sorter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change the `UnsafeExternalSorter` could throw an OOM while spilling. The following sequence of events would have triggered an OOM:\r\n\r\n1. `UnsafeExternalSorter` runs out of space in its pointer array and attempts to allocate a new large array to replace the old one.\r\n2. `TaskMemoryManager` tries to allocate the memory backing the new large array using `MemoryManager`, but `MemoryManager` is only willing to return most but not all of the memory requested.\r\n3. `TaskMemoryManager` asks `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill, which causes `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill the current run to disk, to free its record pages and to reset its `UnsafeInMemorySorter`.\r\n4. `UnsafeInMemorySorter` frees the old pointer array, and tries to allocate a new small pointer array.\r\n5. `TaskMemoryManager` tries to allocate the memory backing the small array using `MemoryManager`, but `MemoryManager` is unwilling to give it any memory, as the `TaskMemoryManager` is still holding on to the memory it got for the new large array.\r\n6. `TaskMemoryManager` again asks `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill, but this time there is nothing to spill.\r\n7. `UnsafeInMemorySorter` receives less memory than it requested, and causes a `SparkOutOfMemoryError` to be thrown, which causes the current task to fail.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in the PR the following will happen instead:\r\n\r\n1. `UnsafeExternalSorter` runs out of space in its pointer array and attempts to allocate a new large array to replace the old one.\r\n2. `TaskMemoryManager` tries to allocate the memory backing the new large array using `MemoryManager`, but `MemoryManager` is only willing to return most but not all of the memory requested.\r\n3. `TaskMemoryManager` asks `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill, which causes `UnsafeExternalSorter` to spill the current run to disk, to free its record pages and to reset its `UnsafeInMemorySorter`.\r\n4. `UnsafeInMemorySorter` frees the old pointer array.\r\n5. `TaskMemoryManager` returns control to `UnsafeExternalSorter.growPointerArrayIfNecessary` (either by returning the the new large array or by throwing a `SparkOutOfMemoryError`).\r\n6. `UnsafeExternalSorter` either frees the new large array or it ignores the `SparkOutOfMemoryError` depending on what happened in the previous step.\r\n7. `UnsafeExternalSorter` successfully allocates a new small pointer array and operation continues as normal.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests were added in `UnsafeExternalSorterSuite` and `UnsafeInMemorySorterSuite`.","created_at":"2020-09-17T11:39:49Z","updated_at":"2020-09-29T11:08:20Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T11:06:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"633672ad5b57f547dafa0c75ed2b45e6c0ee9a41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29785/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29785/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29785/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc510ebb94ea54228dc004d63b79b898b8203dde","head":{"label":"tomvanbussel:SPARK-32901","ref":"SPARK-32901","sha":"fc510ebb94ea54228dc004d63b79b898b8203dde","user":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174318680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMTg2ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"tomvanbussel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Change the target error calculation according to the paper [Space-Efficient Online Computation of Quantile Summaries](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~datar/courses/cs361a/papers/quantiles.pdf). It says that the error `e = max(gi, deltai)/2` (see the page 59). Also this has clear explanation [ε-approximate quantiles](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/584/Syllabus/08-Quantile/Greenwald.html#proofprop1).\r\n2. Added a test to check different accuracies.\r\n3. Added an input CSV file `percentile_approx-input.csv.bz2` to the resource folder `sql/catalyst/src/main/resources` for the test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix incorrect percentile calculation, see an example in SPARK-32908.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By running existing tests in `QuantileSummariesSuite` and in `ApproximatePercentileQuerySuite`.\r\n- Added new test `SPARK-32908: maximum target error in percentile_approx` to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr fix failed and aborted cases in sql hive-thriftserver module in Scala 2.13, the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Use `s.c.Seq` instead of `Seq` in `HiveResult` because the input type maybe `mutable.ArraySeq`, but `Seq` represent `immutable.Seq` in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n- Reset classLoader after `HiveMetastoreLazyInitializationSuite` completed because context class loader is `NonClosableMutableURLClassLoader`  in `HiveMetastoreLazyInitializationSuite` running process, and it propagate to `HiveThriftServer2ListenerSuite` trigger following problems in Scala 2.13:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHiveThriftServer2ListenerSuite:\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.LinkageError: loader constraint

tested?\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: All tests passed.\r\n\r\nDo the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nrevert blockify gmm\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n@WeichenXu123  and I thought we should use memory size instead of number of rows to blockify instance; then if a buffer's size is large and determined by number of rows, we should discard it.\r\nIn GMM, we found that the pre-allocated memory maybe too large and should be discarded:\r\n```\r\n@transient private lazy val auxiliaryPDFMat = DenseMatrix.zeros(blockSize, numFeatures)\r\n```\r\nWe had some offline discuss and thought it is better to revert blockify

why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbugfix, without a proper token refresher, the long-running apps are going to fail potentially in kerberized cluster\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

clean package -pl :kyuubi-spark-sql-engine\r\n```\r\n#### 2. config the spark with Kerberos settings towards your secured cluster\r\n\r\n#### 3. start it in the background\r\n```\r\nnohup

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to make GeneratePredicate eliminate common sub-expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBoth GenerateMutableProjection and GenerateUnsafeProjection, such codegen objects can eliminate common sub-expressions. But GeneratePredicate currently doesn't do it.\r\n\r\nWe encounter a customer issue that a Filter pushed down through a Project causes performance issue, compared with not pushed down case. The issue is one expression used in Filter predicates are run many times. Due to the complex schema, the query nodes are not wholestage codegen, so it runs Filter.doExecute and then call GeneratePredicate. The common expression was run many time and became performance bottleneck. GeneratePredicate should be able to eliminate common sub-expressions for such case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2020-09-16T20:34:08Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:13Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T05:40:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a55ba130c89a36c0a562e73a761e53e11303edd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29776/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29776/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29776/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0dc312e3499d76d5c827e21b698aeff48db57001","head":{"label":"viirya:filter-pushdown","ref":"filter-pushdown","sha":"0dc312e3499d76d5c827e21b698aeff48db57001","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fix the flaky `ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite`: Avoid first `schedule()` invocation after `ExecutorAllocationManager` started.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite` is still flaky, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29722/checks?check_run_id=1117979237\r\n\r\nBy checking the below logs, we can see that there's a race condition between thread `pool-1-thread-1-ScalaTest-running` and thread `spark-dynamic-executor-allocation`.  The only possibility of thread `spark-dynamic-executor-allocation` becoming active is the first time invocation of `schedule()`(since the `TEST_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL`(30s) is really long, so it's impossible the second invocation would happen).  Thus, I think we shall avoid the first invocation too.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n20/09/15 12:41:20.831 pool-1-thread-1-ScalaTest-running-ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite INFO ExecutorAllocationManager: Requesting 1 new executor because tasks are backlogged (new desired total will be 2 for resource profile id: 0)\r\n20/09/15 12:41:20.832 spark-dynamic-executor-allocation INFO ExecutorAllocationManager: Requesting 2 new executors because tasks are backlogged (new desired total will be 4 for resource profile id: 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe flaky can't be reproduced locally so it's hard to say it has been completely fixed by now. We need time to see the result.","created_at":"2020-09-16T13:29:17Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T13:21:56Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T11:20:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cae86c0a05feee83fb313aa4777d851209be7388","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7861b904d83dc05b3eaa753b742b759787f5a11","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-SPARK-32287","ref":"fix-SPARK-32287","sha":"a7861b904d83dc05b3eaa753b742b759787f5a11","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the way `UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator` checks whether it has spilled already, by checking whether `inMemSorter` is null. It also allows it to spill other `UnsafeSorterIterator`s than `UnsafeInMemorySorter.SortedIterator`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR `UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator` could not spill when there are NULLs in the input and radix sorting is used. Currently, Spark determines whether UnsafeExternalSorter.SpillableIterator has not spilled yet by checking whether `upstream` is an instance of `UnsafeInMemorySorter.SortedIterator`. When radix sorting is used and there are NULLs in the input however, `upstream` will be an instance of `UnsafeExternalSorter.ChainedIterator` instead, and Spark will assume that the `SpillableIterator` iterator has spilled already, and therefore cannot spill again when it's supposed to spill.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test was added to `UnsafeExternalSorterSuite` (and therefore also to `UnsafeExternalSorterRadixSortSuite`). I manually confirmed that the test failed in `UnsafeExternalSorterRadixSortSuite` without this patch.","created_at":"2020-09-16T11:58:50Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T13:10:36Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T10:35:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a44c24b4e693a45dd4cbd6dba2154d1f933c17d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e514327b4e071f0e4c8e3402cbf03d54c83ab8a4","head":{"label":"tomvanbussel:SPARK-32900","ref":"SPARK-32900","sha":"e514327b4e071f0e4c8e3402cbf03d54c83ab8a4","user":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174318680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMTg2ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"tomvanbussel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `DataStreamWriter.saveAsTable` to specify the output \"table\" to write from the streaming query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor now, there's no way to write to the table (especially catalog table) even the table is capable to handle streaming write, so even with Spark 3, writing to the catalog table via SS should go through the `DataStreamWriter.format(provider)` and wish the provider can handle it as same as we do with catalog table.\r\n\r\nWith the new API, we can directly point to the catalog table which supports streaming write. Some of usages are covered with tests - simply saying, end users can do the following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// assuming `testcat` is a custom catalog, and `ns` is a namespace in the catalog\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns.table1 (id bigint, data string) USING foo\")\r\n\r\nval query = inputDF\r\n      .writeStream\r\n      .option(...)\r\n      .saveAsTable(\"testcat.ns.table1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, as this adds a new public API in DataStreamWriter. This doesn't bring backward incompatible change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2020-09-16T03:13:22Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T22:08:16Z","closed_at":"2020-10-09T10:02:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d901f378663451933a827e119cab4a24f5d97455","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR only checks if there's any physical rule runs instead of a specific rule. This is rather just a trivial fix to make the tests more robust.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I faced a test failure from a in-house fork that applies a different physical rule that makes `CollapseCodegenStages` ineffective.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the test more robust by unrelated changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. Jenkins tests should pass.","created_at":"2020-09-16T01:11:52Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:39Z","closed_at":"2020-09-16T03:07:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd1525e4431f3b743a1568cd6269bf648b969324","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29766/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29766/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29766/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80ac7d25edd7a8570e9b666791aa7215256fb6d0","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32704","ref":"SPARK-32704","sha":"80ac7d25edd7a8570e9b666791aa7215256fb6d0","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a backport for [pr#29580](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29580) to branch 2.4.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nProcessing for `ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` is controlled by  `numActiveThreads` in `Inbox`. Now if any fatal error happens during `Inbox.process`, `numActiveThreads` is not reduced. Then other threads can not process messages in that inbox, which causes the endpoint to \"hang\". For other type of endpoints, we also should keep  `numActiveThreads` correct.\r\n\r\nThis problem is more serious in previous Spark 2.x versions since the driver, executor and block manager endpoints are all thread safe endpoints.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we should reduce the number of active threads if fatal error happens in `Inbox.process`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`numActiveThreads` is not correct when fatal error happens and will cause the described problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a backport for [pr#29580](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29580) to branch 3.0.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nProcessing for `ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` is controlled by  `numActiveThreads` in `Inbox`. Now if any fatal error happens during `Inbox.process`, `numActiveThreads` is not reduced. Then other threads can not process messages in that inbox, which causes the endpoint to \"hang\". For other type of endpoints, we also should keep  `numActiveThreads` correct.\r\n\r\nThis problem is more serious in previous Spark 2.x versions since the driver, executor and block manager endpoints are all thread safe endpoints.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we should reduce the number of active threads if fatal error happens in `Inbox.process`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`numActiveThreads` is not correct when fatal error happens and will cause the described problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new test.","created_at":"2020-09-15T17:01:53Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T18:43:42Z","closed_at":"2020-09-18T01:01:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ccdbaa5c1e19a888f4341b42908b7a0e97d60184","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/589061c6b7432a26e1a7d7c1ab9eef2e97472483","head":{"label":"wzhfy:deal_with_fatal_error_3.0","ref":"deal_with_fatal_error_3.0","sha":"589061c6b7432a26e1a7d7c1ab9eef2e97472483","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

and xxHash64 interpret sequences of bytes as integers\r\nencoded in little-endian byte order. This requires a byte reversal\r\non big endian platforms.\r\n\r\nI've left the hashInt and hashLong functions as-is for now. My\r\ninterpretation of these functions is that they perform the hash on\r\nthe integer value as if it were serialized in little-endian byte\r\norder. Therefore no byte reversal is necessary.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify hash functions to produce correct results on big-endian platforms.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHash functions produce incorrect results on big-endian platforms which, amongst other potential issues, causes test failures.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests run on the IBM Z (s390x) platform which uses a big-endian byte order.","created_at":"2020-09-15T13:56:43Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T17:36:58Z","closed_at":"2020-09-23T17:36:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29c721049e1e27b55cff63a9e5c2dde3a9859705","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cbfa4d63efba01fd06747260e252bac466d99853","head":{"label":"linux-on-ibm-z:fix-hashes","ref":"fix-hashes","sha":"cbfa4d63efba01fd06747260e252bac466d99853","user":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42882114,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjg4MjExNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"linux-on-ibm-z/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linux-on-ibm-z","id":11740175,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExNzQwMTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11740175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z","html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linux-on-ibm-z/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/spark","description":"Mirror

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

Job page link in \"Event Timeline\" view is constructed by fetching job page link defined in job list below. when job count exceeds page size of job table, only links of jobs in job table can be fetched from page. Other jobs' link would be 'undefined', and links of them in \"Event Timeline\" are broken, they are redirected to some wired URL like \".../jobs/undefined\". This PR is fixing this wrong link issue. With this PR, job link in \"Event Timeline\" view would always redirect to correct job page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWrong link (\".../jobs/undefined\") in \"Event Timeline\" of jobs page. for example, the first job in below page is not in table below, as job count(116) exceeds page size(100). When clicking it's item in \"Event Timeline\", page is redirected to \".../jobs/undefined\", which is wrong. Links in \"Event Timeline\" should always be correct.\r\n![undefinedlink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/93184779-83fa6d80-f6f1-11ea-8a80-1a304ca9cbb2.JPG)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to add a new `table` API in DataStreamReader, which is similar to the table API in DataFrameReader. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers can directly use this API to get a Streaming DataFrame on a table. Below is a simple example:\r\n\r\nApplication 1 for initializing and starting the streaming job:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval path = \"/home/yuanjian.li/runtime/to_be_deleted\"\r\nval tblName = \"my_table\"\r\n\r\n// Write some data to `my_table`\r\nspark.range(3).write.format(\"parquet\").option(\"path\", path).saveAsTable(tblName)\r\n\r\n// Read the table as a streaming source, write result to destination directory\r\nval table = spark.readStream.table(tblName)\r\ntable.writeStream.format(\"parquet\").option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"/home/yuanjian.li/runtime/to_be_deleted_ck\").start(\"/home/yuanjian.li/runtime/to_be_deleted_2\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nApplication 2 for appending new data:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Append new data into the path\r\nspark.range(5).write.format(\"parquet\").option(\"path\", \"/home/yuanjian.li/runtime/to_be_deleted\").mode(\"append\").save()\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck result:\r\n```\r\n// The desitination directory should contains all written data\r\nspark.read.parquet(\"/home/yuanjian.li/runtime/to_be_deleted_2\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new API added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT added and integrated testing.","created_at":"2020-09-15T06:25:36Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T10:36:50Z","closed_at":"2020-09-25T06:50:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ad2472dc39701cdc7a9c4f17e03f5a15b30dc14","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to mark the following suite as `ExtendedSQLTest` to reduce GitHub Action test time.\r\n- TPCDSQuerySuite\r\n- TPCDSQueryANSISuite\r\n- TPCDSQueryWithStatsSuite\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the longest GitHub Action task is `Build and test / Build modules: sql - other tests` with `1h 57m 10s` while `Build and test / Build modules: sql - slow tests` takes `42m 20s`. With this PR, we can move the workload from `other tests` to `slow tests` task and reduce the total waiting time about 7 ~ 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the GitHub Action with the reduced running time.","created_at":"2020-09-15T04:21:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T08:08:48Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T05:38:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e66fff6bfa898d4ce99909f9fe316e5ab12e59de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0b2483d37c8f74ab76d2bad2deb2ac992ee1d1a3","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-SLOWTEST","ref":"SPARK-SLOWTEST","sha":"0b2483d37c8f74ab76d2bad2deb2ac992ee1d1a3","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0811666ab104b41cf189233439f4158b18bc8282","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen BytesToBytesMap is at `MAX_CAPACITY` and reaches its growth threshold, `numKeys >= growthThreshold` is true but `longArray.size() / 2 < MAX_CAPACITY` is false. This correctly prevents the map from growing, but `canGrowArray` incorrectly remains true. Therefore the map keeps accepting new keys and exceeds its growth threshold. If we attempt to spill the map in this state, the UnsafeKVExternalSorter will not be able to reuse the long array for sorting. By this point the task has typically consumed all available memory, so the allocation of the new pointer array is likely to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by setting `canGrowArray` to false in this case. This prevents the map from accepting new elements when it cannot grow to accommodate them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, hash aggregations will fail when the number of groups per task is greater than `MAX_CAPACITY / 2 = 2^28` (approximately 268 million), and when the grouping aggregation is the only memory-consuming operator in its stage.\r\n\r\nFor example, the final aggregation in `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM tbl` fails when `tbl` contains 1 billion distinct values and when `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReproducing this issue requires building a very large BytesToBytesMap. Because this is infeasible to do in a unit test, this PR was tested manually by adding the following test to AbstractBytesToBytesMapSuite. Before this PR, the test fails in 8.5 minutes. With this PR, the test passes in 1.5 minutes.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class AbstractBytesToBytesMapSuite {\r\n  // ...\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void respectGrowthThresholdAtMaxCapacity() {\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR refactors the way we propagate the options from the `SparkSession.Builder` to the` SessionState`. This currently done via a mutable map inside the SparkSession. These setting settings are then applied **after** the Session. This is a bit confusing when you expect something to be set when constructing the `SessionState`. This PR passes the options as a constructor parameter to the `SessionStateBuilder` and this will set the options when the configuration is created.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt makes it easier to reason about the configurations set in a SessionState than before. We recently had an incident where someone was using `SparkSessionExtensions` to create a planner rule that relied on a conf to be set. While this is in itself probably incorrect usage, it still illustrated this somewhat funky behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid scheduling the (non-zombie) TaskSetManager which has no pending tasks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark always tries to schedule a (non-zombie) TaskSetManager even if it has no pending tasks. This causes notable problems for the barrier TaskSetManager: 1. `calculateAvailableSlots` can be called for multiple times for a launched barrier TaskSetManager; 2. user would see \"Skip current round of resource offers for barrier stage\" log message for  \r\na launched barrier TaskSetManager all the time until the barrier TaskSetManager finishes, which is quite confused.\r\n\r\nBesides, scheduling a TaskSetManager always involves many function invocations even if there're no pending tasks.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think we can skip those un-schedulable TasksetManagers to avoid the potential overhead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.","created_at":"2020-09-14T15:32:32Z","updated_at":"2020-09-15T05:19:08Z","closed_at":"2020-09-15T04:15:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a596cddbdf841c763e3ea42823585ec84527818b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29750/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29750/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29750/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/718590dc2beafcafd570ff13b9a09d06b7cc3326","head":{"label":"Ngone51:filter-out-unschedulable-stage","ref":"filter-out-unschedulable-stage","sha":"718590dc2beafcafd570ff13b9a09d06b7cc3326","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr aims to support Hive UDF when input type is not expected. We make `HiveSimpleUDF` extends `ImplicitCastInputTypes` then using `Analyzer` to implicit cast input data type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a compatible issue. In normal case, data type is converted by Hive ObjectInspector at running time. But Hive not support input decimal type when method required double type. Unfortunately the default type of 1.1 is different between Spark and Hive, which are decimal and double. Then caused this issue.\r\n\r\nBefore this pr, we failed in this code.\r\n```\r\nclass ArraySumUDF extends UDF {\r\n  import scala.collection.JavaConverters._\r\n  def evaluate(values: java.util.List[java.lang.Double]): java.lang.Double = {\r\n    var r = 0d\r\n    for (v <- values.asScala) {\r\n      r += v\r\n    }\r\n    r\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nsql(s\"CREATE FUNCTION testArraySum AS '${classOf[ArraySumUDF].getName}'\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT testArraySum(array(1, 1.1, 1.2))\")\r\n\r\n-- error msg\r\nError in query: No handler for UDF/UDAF/UDTF 'ArraySumUDF': org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.NoMatchingMethodException: No matching method for class ArraySumUDF with (array<decimal(11,1)>). Possible choices: _FUNC_(array<double>)  ; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, user can get correct result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe Jenkins job fails to get the versions. This was fixed by adding temporary fallbacks at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28536.\r\nThis still doesn't work without the temporary fallbacks. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29694\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new fallbacks since 2.3 is EOL and Spark 3.0.1 and 2.4.7 are released.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo test correctly in Jenkins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins and GitHub Actions builds should test.","created_at":"2020-09-14T10:39:34Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:40Z","closed_at":"2020-09-14T20:54:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"551110266b9c00b0ec39ca3a978b549ca96744f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29748/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29748/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29748/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec8e7c07914ef00be9cdc15575e28f5cd2c4f8a3","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32876","ref":"SPARK-32876","sha":"ec8e7c07914ef00be9cdc15575e28f5cd2c4f8a3","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
