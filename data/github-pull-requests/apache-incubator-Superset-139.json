Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn #4833, we tried to introduce a feature that setting old async query status to be timed_out, when the query status stuck at pending or running after 6 hours. This status update will help front-end (browser) not fetching very old query status. But i found that backend actually didn't commit transaction, so the whole query/update logic seems no use.\r\n\r\nIn #7429 I was trying to fix this issue by adding db commit.  But I also found in front-end javascript, we have logic that don't poll query status after `SQLLAB_ASYNC_TIME_LIMIT_SEC` reached. I feel the additional query/update in backend every second, seems expensive and not necessary. So I propose to remove this query/update logic from every polling request.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and watch query

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPresto supports using the optional cluster when specifying the table name, i.e., `[[cluster.]schema].table` however the currently SQL parse logic only returns at most the first two components, i.e., `cluster.schema` if a cluster was defined.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the logic to support the `[[cluster.]schema].table` construct as well as:\r\n\r\n- Ensures the table construct is valid in terms of length and structure. \r\n- Ensures that the quotes are removed from each token. Previously this was only the case when only the table was specified which were removed via `get_real_name()`. \r\n- The `get_real_name()` logic wasn't overly apparent though it's used when a table alias is present. I felt this logic wasn't overly clear and in the case of a `TokenList` representing `schema.table AS foo` the `get_real_name()` only returns `table` (though this wasn't invoked because there was the `.` token). From a table construct validity perspective it seems more prudent to strip the alias and then extract the full table name if valid.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe have a large table where not all combinations of values are applicable and we need to have a step that calls an endpoint to verify the dimensions and metrics included in the groupby, filter, and metrics controls. This creates a withVerification HOC that verifies options before passing them to the resulting control. \r\n\r\nThese controls aren't currently being used in the app, but we'll use them through control overrides in our deployment. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nUse controlOverrides to set this control for certain chart types\r\nAlso in controlOverrides: \r\n\r\n- Pass it a getEndpoint function that builds an endpoint from the controlValues\r\n- Set controlValues in a customized mapStateToProps \r\n\r\nCheck to make sure validation is working\r\nCheck to make sure normal options are present (no validation) when there's no getEndpoint\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSuperset provides endpoints for storing and retrieving key-value pairs from database storage. For example, /explore/kv/store takes a data POST parameter for an arbitrary string to store and returns the corresponding key, which is a simple integer counter. To retrieve the saved data, users issue a GET request to /explore/kv/<key>. The application returns the associated value with the response Content-Type set to text/html, meaning it is possible for users to construct arbitrary HTML pages.\r\nThe attacker can simply create another key-value pair with JavaScript source code in the value and include it from the constructed HTML page. Since the script source comes from the same origin as the HTML page, the CSP permits the browser to execute it\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThere were issues executing long queries because we saved the strings to text columns in the query table. The queries would be truncated based on the storage size of the text column (i.e. Text in mysql can hold 65k characters - 64 KB). I have added a migration script to update the columns to hold longer strings.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested that the columns were long text columns in a mysql table after migration.\r\n\r\n###

This closes #6707 too.\r\n\r\nThis adds a (debounced) call to the `validate_sql_json` API endpoint with the querytext. If no validator is configured for the selected database, per the feature flag from #7422, no validation requests will be sent from the UI. On Lyft's infra the presto validator is able to return feedback to the user (end to end) in about 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nAt present feedback is provided only through the \"annotations\" mechanism build in to ACE, although I'd be open to adding full text elsewhere on the page if there's interest.\r\n\r\nThis diff does not include new cypress tests covering this interaction.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n![validation-med](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/596042/57239173-60e18900-6fe8-11e9-99fe-086968204e70.gif)\r\n\r\nServer error reporting:\r\n<img width=\"921\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-05 at 7 19 38 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/596042/57239184-663ed380-6fe8-11e9-93e0-c00883f3579b.png\">\r\n\r\nQuery error reporting:\r\n<img width=\"543\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-05 at 7 21 08 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/596042/57239186-68089700-6fe8-11e9-8845-6dbbd6e3a810.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1. Start a development instance\r\n2. Follow the instructions in INSTALLING to enable the presto validator\r\n3. Connect to a prestodb instance\r\n4. Try writing some queries against it!\r\n\r\nYou can verify the unhappy paths by:\r\n\r\n* Injecting 5xx into your communications with presto\r\n* Using a database which does not support validation (like the built-in sqlite). Note that no validation attempts will even be made in this case.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [X] Has associated issue: #6707\r\n- [X] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ]

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn SQL Lab, table names are currently assumed to follow the following convention:\r\n- `schema.table` or\r\n- `table`\r\n\r\nThis is handled in the frontend by assuming that a period in the table name always implies a separator between schema and table name. Since there is no standardized way for SQLAlchemy inspectors to return table names (some return `schema.table`, others only `table`), they can be in either format. Since some databases (at least Apache Drill and Postgres) support periods in schema and table names, and their respective inspectors don't return schema prefixed table names, this causes problems when querying tables, as `TableSelector` strips away everything before the period character. This PR moves this logic from the frontend to the backend, and makes it possible to configure this behavior per engine.\r\n\r\nThis proposal changes table name handling in the following way:\r\n1. An attribute `try_remove_schema_from_table_name` is added to `db_engine_specs` (defaults to `True`). By default, when `True`, `get_table_names()` and `get_view_names()` checks if a table name starts with the schema name followed by a period, and if so, removes the schema name from the table name. Example: `schema.table` becomes `table`, while `table` remains unchanged.\r\n2. Table names are passed as dicts `{'schema': 'schema_name', 'table': 'table_name'}` when handed to the frontend. Previously they were either of the format `table` or `schema.table`. This removes any ambiguity in the frontend.\r\n3. SQL Lab UI now works in the following way:\r\n   - If no schema is selected, table/view names are displayed in the dropdown as `schema.table`.\r\n   - If a schema is selected, tables are shown as `table` only in the dropdown.\r\nFiltering also supports this, i.e. when no schema is chosen, the filter substring makes the comparison assuming that the table name is `schema.table`, making it possible to include the schema name in the filter string.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nWhen no schema is chosen, table names are displayed as `schema.table`:\r\n<img width=\"313\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-05-09 at 21 09 07\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/57547924-59174100-7368-11e9-917d-2ed26ad161c3.png\">\r\n\r\nIf a schema is selected, only the table name is shown (in this case the table name is `test.table`, not `table` in schema `test`):\r\n<img width=\"302\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-05-09 at 21 09 43\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/57547948-66ccc680-7368-11e9-86da-8e858acbf97b.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested locally on Postgres and sqlite.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn some companies they need to product query requests again CSRF, while other companies may not need it. Airbnb security team requested that explore_json endpoint should only allow POST method (with CSRF protection), and should not expose data parameters in request url. Currently even with feature flag to disable GET request, the backend will respond to both GET and POST requests regardless of the flag value. \r\n\r\n**Solution**: \r\nwhen **ENABLE_EXPLORE_JSON_CSRF_PROTECTION** feature flag is set to `True`, GETs are disabled in explore_json endpoint, and the backend does nothing and responds with a **405 MethodNotAllowed**\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the Meetup on [2019-05-03](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRLqmUn-G7WiPe8qZnfuvbrYHZ1jmk9aSv9Bhjis2tg/edit#) a security audit at Airbnb surfaced a few recommendations in terms of security header settings. Specifically they recommended:\r\n\r\n- Setting the secure flag on session cookies\r\n- Support HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)\r\n\r\nReading through the Flask security [documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/security/#security-headers) on security header they mention that the [Flask-Talisman](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/flask-talisman) package can be used to manage various security headers.   \r\n\r\nIt mentions that a subset of default configuration/options handles: \r\n\r\n> - Sets X-Frame-Options to SAMEORIGIN to avoid clickjacking.\r\n> - Sets Flask's session cookie to secure, so it will never be set if your application is somehow accessed via a non-secure connection.\r\n> - strict_transport_security, default True, whether to send HSTS headers.\r\n\r\nThe first one was already enabled for Superset and the later two addresses the two security concerns mentioned above.  Unless we have dedicated or knowledgable security personnel, using something like Flask-Talisman with a blanket type approach to best practices around security seems like a good approach. \r\n\r\nNote it's not apparent whether each Superset installation would want to handle security differently and currently the package is configurable only via the `Talisman` class or `Talisman.init_app(...)` options. In the future if we require this to be more configurable we could expose some of these configurations in Superset's configuration or leverage the mutator, i.e., \r\n\r\n```\r\n# superset/__init__.py\r\n\r\ntalisman = Talisman()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# superset_config.py\r\n\r\nFLASK_APP_MUTATOR = mutator\r\n\r\ndef mutator(app):\r\n    from superset import talisman \r\n   \r\n    talisman.init_app(app, force_https=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\nto: @betodealmeida @DiggidyDave @dpgaspar @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7198 fixed a race condition in SQL Lab where the query payload would have state `success` but the `resultsKey` was set to `null`. Because of this, SQL Lab would stop polling the queries, but would never show the results because there was no `resultsKey`.\r\n\r\n@vylc reported that the bug is still happening. As a workaround, I changed the code so that it keeps polling when the state is `success` but `resultsKeys` is `null`. This should make the frontend poll until it can show the results from the query.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce the problem, which is why I did this workaround. But I tested SQL Lab with this change, and it works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nA row or array column is displayed in a single column. This was difficult to comprehend if there were many fields in the row or array.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nName: ColumnA\r\nData type: row(nested_column1 float, rowA row(rowB row(nested_column2 int)))\r\n\r\nPrevious Data Grid Display:\r\n<img width=\"86\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-02 at 2 49 51 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/57109142-8ff6b280-6ce9-11e9-914c-469b91cfa0da.png\">\r\n\r\nThis change will separate out row fields into its own column.\r\n\r\nNew Data Grid Display: \r\n<img width=\"463\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-02 at 2 49 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/57109145-938a3980-6ce9-11e9-8137-6d7714cb6f50.png\">\r\n\r\nIf the array is an array of row objects, we just display the whole thing like before. Ideally we would like to see that information more clearly but that is tracked by another story.\r\n\r\nThe changes look like a lot but really we are just doing the following 2 things:\r\n1. Filter out any columns related to arrays of row objects. For example:\r\nName: ColumnB\r\nData type: array(row(nested_column int))\r\nWe have column objects for ColumnB and ColumnB.nested_column but we ignore the object corresponding to ColumnB.nested_column because we cannot easily create a select statement for such columns.\r\n2. Create column clauses correctly where column names in dot notation are quoted and we provide a label for the column. For example:\r\nColumnA.nested_object would be represented as \"ColumnA\".\"nested_object\" AS \"ColumnA.nested_object\"\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManually and added unit tests\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@betodealmeida @DiggidyDave @bearcage @xtinec @datability-io @john-bodley @michellethomas @graceguo-supercat @mistercrunch \r\n\r\n@williaster @kristw I made a small change to the data grid where headers are elided from the left if they are too

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn [SIP-13](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/6132) we discussed having automated checks for code coverage (section [P.5.3]). This PR creates a codecov yaml for us to set the targets and thresholds we want, so if we add a setting in the repo to alert if these rules aren't met, we can change them if we feel they are too strict.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nShould we have folders we ignore? I initially put in the visualizations folder to ignore because it's been difficult to add unit tests to cover this code, is that what we want? Are there other folders to ignore?\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nUsed codecov's validator `curl --data-binary @.codecov.yml https://codecov.io/validate`\r\nTested on a PR on in my fork\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn #4833, we tried to introduce a feature that setting old async query status to be `timed_out`, when the query status stuck at pending or running without updates after 6 hours. This status will help front-end (browser) not fetching very old query status. The bug i found is backend didn't commit transaction, so there is no records in query table has status `timed_out` (but keeps in running status for very very long time).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nWhen user's query has no updates after 6 hours, front-end should show this error message:\r\n<img width=\"1097\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-01 at 11 55 41 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/57094253-f5847800-6cc4-11e9-915b-0a69210a2fc3.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nsend async query, then check query table. We should see old queries status that were `running` or `pending`,  should updated to be `timed_out`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

to stick as much to the existing query machinery\r\nas possible to avoid introducing too much new state for handling\r\nthis, so I plumbed it through as a db spec parameter and an\r\noption you can set on an individual query.\r\n\r\nAs of this commit:\r\n\r\n- [X] Plumb validation db_spec options\r\n- [X] Add validation_only option and transform to the sql_json view\r\n- [x] Tests for the above on the backend\r\n- [ ] Debounced requestValidationQuery in onSqlChange\r\n- [ ] Check incoming results -- full query vs validation\r\n- [ ] Tests for the above on the frontend\r\n- [ ] Highlight error lines\r\n- [ ] Print error message in alert-danger box above toolbar controls\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTests incoming in another commit on this PR\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [X] Has associated issue: #6707\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [X] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing

browser behavior. This resulted in the Dashboard export action failing. My fix is to build a link and click it, which does work consistently.\r\n\r\nThe related Python code is here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/views/core.py#L675-L696

fix is to make sure the scoped session created by the superset\r\ninit code (that creates a bunch of roles and permissions) will\r\nbe released and potentially committed when the superset/__init__.py\r\ngoes out of scope. \r\n\r\n\tmodified:   superset/__init__.py\r\n\r\n### CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWithout running in a context, the code leaves the session open with a lock on ab_view_menu\r\nmetadata, which prevents migration cefabc8f7d38_increase_size_of_name_column_in_ab_view\r\nfrom running an ALTER on that table. \r\nAnother contributor suggested explicitly closing the session or trying to use the same session inside the migration code. This requires more engineering and the sm.session.close() would have to be explicit. Any new interaction with the database would cause the problem to happen again.\r\nSee here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/1260#issuecomment-334115725\r\nI found using an app context to work better to encapsulate the superset init code, in case people add more logic there, the session close will happen automatically as the context goes out of scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a lightweight way of scheduling queries in SQL Lab. If the feature flag `SCHEDULED_QUERIES` is enabled with proper configuration, a button called \"Schedule Query\" will show up in SQL Lab. The button allows queries to be saved with extra metadata that allows an external scheduler to run it periodically by polling the `/savedqueryviewapi/api/read` endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe sample configuration can be changed or expanded to support different metadata needed, depending on the scheduler. We tested it with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) at Lyft successfully.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn #6013, we introduced a feature: in sql lab, after user sent out query, if there is no response from backend in a few seconds, sql lab will display `offline` label, to remind user to check network connection or VPN connection. This feature was trying to fix an issue like, a user might open sql lab in an environment without internet connection, or move computer from one place to another,  when he run sql lab, the query may stuck in `pending` state for a long time, but user may not be aware it's network connection issue or sql lab performance issue.\r\n\r\nThe threshold for waiting backend response was 7 seconds. But we found many users in slow internet connect (or VPN) environment, 7 seconds is too short. So they will see `offline` label first, then query response come back later, this experience is very confusing. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, i want to increase the wait threshold from 7 second to 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nno\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nmanual test\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @timifasubaa @michellethomas

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe \"Chart Options\" section is showing up under the data tab which looks confusing because it contains controls for the color, legend (things that don't affect the data). The section is moved to the data tab if any of the controls don't have renderTrigger true, so if label_colors is set to `renderTrigger` the \"Chart Options\" goes back to the Visual tab. \r\n\r\n###

This patch contains a possible fix for the first of them (\"URL redirection from remote source\") that follows the website's own recommendation: Check the input against some known source before using it. I've checked that the dashboard ID provided actually exists in DB and if it doesn't I return a 404.\r\nI plan to solve the other 4 issues labeled as \"Error\" but wanted to get some early feedback before moving on.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nI've written a unit test that can be run e.g. like:\r\n`tox -e py37 -- tests/access_tests.py:RequestAccessTests.test_dashboard_endpoint_malicious_redirect`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIf a column is an array or row, we did not show their data type in the schema view or its contents. For example, say we have ColumnA and its type is row(nest_obj double). \r\n\r\nPrevious Display:\r\n**ColumnA    NULL**\r\n- We would display ColumnA's data type as NULL and we would not display any information about nested_obj. \r\n\r\nCurrent Display:\r\n**ColumnA     ROW\r\nColumnA.nested_obj       double** \r\n- Now we display ColumnA's data type and its contents.\r\n\r\nWhy did we implement our own logic to handle row and array data types? It is because we use the pyhive library to get columns but they do not handle complex data types. They see row and array objects as unknown types and then assign it as a null type. Fortunately, the information we receive from Presto is predictable and that's why we have a string parser to make sense of the reply.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested manually and wrote unit tests\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@xtinec @bearcage @DiggidyDave @datability-io @betodealmeida @mistercrunch  @john-bodley @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR corresponds to SIP https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7380   \r\nIt allows the Filter Box to optionally source its option labels from a different field than the filter value. \r\n\r\n*Notes:* \r\n\r\n- this is backwards-compatible/non-breaking. The fallback/default behavior is to use the original label=value strategy. This also doesn't interfere with the metric property implementation. \r\n\r\n### ~~BEFORE/~~ AFTER SCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\n**New Filter Box configuration** \r\n*Note the second select box, labeled \"Single Option Label\". It's a poor name for the option, but \"Label\" is more relevant where it is, and clarification was needed.* \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-04-25 09-17-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12756908/56738681-11bf6c80-673b-11e9-84fe-4fd483ffa42a.png)\r\n\r\n**Filter Box using the friendly labels.** \r\n![Screenshot from 2019-04-25 09-16-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12756908/56738589-eb013600-673a-11e9-8d22-6d30ac9ab5fd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n_all code/config here is from my personal reference implementation. of course, adjust field names/sql as needed_  \r\n\r\n1. Setup a query that returns at least 2 fields: one for the filter value, and a separate one for the filter label \r\n- The source query from my reference use-case is:\r\n```sql\r\nselect array_agg(gorm_pipeline_resources.tokenized_resource_id) as pipeline_datasets, pipelines.name as pipeline_name\r\nfrom pipelines\r\n         left join users on pipelines.owner_id = users.id\r\n         left join gorm_pipeline_resources on pipelines.id = gorm_pipeline_resources.pipeline_id\r\nwhere owner_id = 1\r\ngroup by pipelines.id\r\norder by pipeline_name ASC\r\n```\r\n- its sql lab output is\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-04-25 09-27-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12756908/56739333-6a433980-673c-11e9-94fb-845d325531e0.png)\r\n\r\n2. Configure a filter box using this datasource, according to the screenshots above. \r\n- For the filter in question, select Column: `pipeline_datasets` Single Option Label: `pipeline_name`\r\n\r\n3. Create a datasource that references the filter: \r\n```jinja2\r\n{% set vals = filter_values('pipeline_datasets', '0')[0] %}\r\nSELECT  datasource_id as \"ds_id\",\r\n        other_fields,\r\nfrom some_table\r\nWHERE datasource_id in ({{ vals|replace(\"[\",'')|replace(\"]\",'') }})\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. As usual, add the filter box, and chart(s) whose datasets reference the filter param. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Changes UI: optionally, allows filter box labels to come from a different field than the values. \r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API: resolves SIP #7380 (pending) \r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n###

If I add the following snipped to the WorldMapViz in superset/viz.py everything works as expected again:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        qry['metrics'] = [\r\n            self.form_data['metric'], self.form_data['secondary_metric']]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe .iloc functionality in WorldMap is not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with parsing SQL where iterating over the identifiers associated with a `sqlparser` `IdentifierList` yields a `Token` (as opposed to a `TokenList`) resulting in the following error:\r\n```\r\nbuiltins:AttributeError: 'Token' object has no attribute 'tokens'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote I worked somewhat extensively with `sqlparse` on an unrelated project and there's probably some merit in restructuring some of this logic in the future. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\nto: @michellethomas @mistercrunch

This effort breaks down large functions into smaller ones, make things DRYer, and add a covering set of tests. The refactor is a bit risky, but much less risky than having the current logic in place.\r\n\r\nI got pulled in this rabbit hole while trying to debug an issue around the \"Polygon\" example, where it would fail when missing the metric (related to color scaler and bounds). I then realized that the validator overrides weren't applied when using `setControlValue`, post load. So I started digging into this patchwork in `store.js` the really evolved to be messy over time.","created_at":"2019-04-23T06:54:14Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:19:21Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T18:45:07Z","merged_at":"2019-04-30T18:45:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"46579b1bd67b798f19e0242f997cd8df60843e40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nA summary of changes:\r\n- Fix a handful of encountered bugs:\r\n   - Compile column names in expressions to ensure quotes are present when needed, the lack of which causes problems on (at least) Postgres.\r\n   - `sum__SP_RUR_TOTL` metric was missing from `wb_health_population`.\r\n   - `sum__value` metric was missing from `unicode_test`.\r\n   - Text columns in `unicode_test` defined as non-Unicode SQLAlchemy type `String`, should be `Unicode`.\r\n   - MySQL fails to import Unicode text due to defaulting to currently using `latin1` charset. Changed default charset to `utf8m4` (per official recommendation). \r\n   - Polygon chart broken due to missing metric.\r\n   - Incorrect height on Polygon chart due to wrong metadata (reference to `js_datapoint_mutator`, should be `js_data_mutator` and incorrect syntax in mutator code).\r\n   - Incorrect color on Path chart due to wrong metadata (same as Polygon chart).\r\n   - Fix edge case in `sqla/models.py` when ordering by a metric whose label has been mutated.\r\n- Add `SAMPLE_DATA_DB_DATASOURCE_NAME` and `SAMPLE_DATA_DB_SCHEMA_NAME` to make it possible to load sample data into any database/schema with csv upload support. Currently loading is only supported into main backend database.\r\n- Make sample data work on all databases. This is made possible by leveraging column label mutation logic found in `db_engine_specs` by conditionally mutating any unsupported column names in sample data and references thereof in the chart metadata. A few examples of columns that need to be mutated:\r\n   - BigQuery: Columns starting with a number, e.g. columns `2004`-`2014` in `birth_france_by_region`\r\n   - Redshift: non-lowercase columns, e.g. column `DEPT_ID` in `birth_france_by_region`\r\n- Move `DataFrame` uploading logic to `db_engine_specs` to enable uploading to engines that don't support vanilla `DataFrame.to_sql()` like BigQuery (requires use of `to_gbq()`). As a biproduct BigQuery now also supports CSV uploading.\r\n- Add `README.md` explaining the steps needed to add a new sample dataset and the more complex parts like conditional mutating of column names.\r\n\r\nBy being able to deploy sample data & charts/dashboards on any db will make it easier to make sure that an engine really works, spot regressions/bugs and also reduce clutter in the main backend database.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\n<img width=\"591\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-24 at 11 28 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/56649582-137f2680-668e-11e9-8f4c-63fac0bc392d.png\">\r\nPolygon heights now work.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"586\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-24 at 11 28 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/56649613-2265d900-668e-11e9-95ef-924caf8b0c01.png\">\r\nPath colors now work\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1235\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-04-24 at 11 29 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/56649638-2bef4100-668e-11e9-85d1-a3f63aa3e6d7.png\">\r\nPicture taken from from sample dataset deployed to BigQuery. Notice the mutated column names (original name `2004`, now prefixed with undescore and trailing md5 hash as per logic in `db_engine_specs`). Having the full md5 hash is slightly overkill, but can be changed later (first 5 few chars should suffice to avoid realistic collision risk).\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested on Sqlite, Postgres and
