Change Logs\r\n\r\nEnable writing of error and data table in parallel. This behavior is disabled by default and can enabled by setting error table config property: `hoodie.errortable.write.union.enable` to true.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe DAG's for data table + error table are sequential today, this change executes them in a union to better utilize the executor resources in the spark driver.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreating a new abstraction HoodieMergeHandle (renaming existing HoodieMergeHandle to HoodieRowMergeHandle)\r\n\r\n- Introduce a new method doMerge that reads base files, merges the records and writes a new target file.\r\n- Make HoodieRowMergeHandle implement HoodieMergeHandle.\r\n- Introduce a config and reflection to make sure we can implement our own custom HoodieMergeHandle.\r\n- Add tests for HoodieMergeHandleFactory.\r\n- Added ability to fallback to default merge handle if custom merge handle instantiation fails. Added a config to enable or disable fallback.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake it flexible to add more write handles.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Reduce listing calls required to perform table services when initializing the metadata writer.\r\n- Reduce redundant listing calls in the metadata writer\r\n- Reduce listing in clean planner\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Added some basic counters for listing in the /metadata directory and see over 20% reduction in listing calls in the DeltaStreamer test suite.\r\n- In case where the cleaner does not have anything to clean, we remove an extra listing call. This will apply to both data and metadata timelines.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

The key improvements include:\r\n\r\n- Filtering commits before metadata parsing to focus only on relevant actions\r\n- Processing multiple commits in parallel using Java streams\r\n- Using atomic accumulators for thread-safe statistics aggregation\r\n- More resilient error handling that continues processing despite individual commit failures\r\n\r\nThe core logic was refactored into a dedicated AverageRecordSizeStats class to improve code organization and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWhile there are no changes to the public API, this optimization provides significant performance benefits when computing record size estimates, particularly for timelines with many commits. The change:\r\n\r\n- Reduces processing time by parallelizing commit metadata parsing\r\n- Provides more accurate size estimates by considering multiple commits instead of stopping at the first valid one\r\n- Improves reliability through better error handling and atomic operations\r\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing behavior when no valid commits are found\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\nThe changes are focused on internal implementation details and maintain the same functional behavior. Extensive unit tests have been added to verify:\r\n\r\n- Parallel processing correctness\r\n- Error handling scenarios\r\n- Boundary conditions (empty timeline, invalid commits)\r\n-  Compatibility with existing configuration parameters\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe expect precombine as mandatory config to be set for mutable streams. For immutable streams, precombine could be avoided based on the writer. With HoodieStreamer, for immutable streams, we could set precombine as empty string and get a pipeline running. This just works bcoz, the precombine is never used anywhere (compaction, snapshot read, dedup etc). But if user enables \"filterDupes\" feature with HoodieStreamer, it breaks.\r\n\r\nSo, in this patch we are relaxing the constraint. Users can still avoid setting precombine and enable \"filterDupes\" feature with HoodieStreamer. Not only for immutable streams, for mutable streams it should be feasible to use \"OverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload\" and get an end to end stream working w/o a need to set an explicit ordering field.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch takes a stab at enabling this.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix a corner case.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

This has caused customer tables' timelines to explode in size over recent months.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Merge into updated & insert actions will fail the query once detect column type mismatch for primary key/partition key/precombined key\r\n\r\nAllowing implicit casting of partition key can leads to partition path corruption. An example is if we do MIT where source table has a double value column and target table partitions on the same column with int type, after merge into completes the partition path will contain double value. Later select queries over the table will complain it cannot convert double to int.\r\n\r\nAllowing implicit casting of primary key can leads to data correctness issue. Here is an example:\r\n```\r\n             create table $targetTable (\r\n               id double,\r\n               name string,\r\n               value_double double,\r\n               ts long\r\n             ) using hudi\r\n             location '${tmp.getCanonicalPath}/$targetTable'\r\n             tblproperties (\r\n               type = '$tableType',\r\n               primaryKey = 'id',\r\n               preCombineField = 'ts'\r\n             );\r\n\r\n\r\n             create table $sourceTable (\r\n               id int,\r\n               name string,\r\n               value_double double,\r\n               ts long\r\n             ) using hudi\r\n             location '${tmp.getCanonicalPath}/$sourceTable'\r\n             tblproperties (\r\n               type = '$tableType',\r\n               primaryKey = 'id',\r\n               preCombineField = 'ts'\r\n             );\r\n\r\n             insert into $targetTable\r\n             select\r\n               cast(1 as double) as id,\r\n               'initial1' as name,\r\n               1.1 as value_double,\r\n               1000 as ts;\r\n\r\n\r\n             insert into $sourceTable\r\n             select\r\n               1 as id,\r\n               'updated1' as name,\r\n               1.11 as value_double,\r\n               1001 as ts;\r\n\r\n\r\n             merge into $targetTable t\r\n             using $sourceTable s\r\n             on t.id = s.id\r\n             when matched then update set *\r\n             when not matched then insert *;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the end we expect target table with 1 record\r\n(1, updated1, 1.1, 1001)\r\n\r\nbut actually it is\r\n(1, initial, 1.1, 1000)\r\n(1, updated1, 1.1, 1001)\r\n\r\nFor precombined field we enforce the same data type check to avoid any potential data correctness issue.\r\n\r\nIf target table id column is int, we got the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n\r\nDelete action does not require strict data type matching, as long as the column types are cast-able from source columns to target columns, it is allowed.\r\n\r\n- Unlike insert/update which contains assignment from source to target, delete operation does not assign values but just comparing them in the ON clause, we just need to ensure the comparison part accounts for type mismatches. Especially, the precombined key column is out of scope as it only takes effect when assignment happens. Similarily, if partition key/primary key are not involved in ON clause, we don't need to do any check.\r\n- For condition clause, the recordKeyAttributeToConditionExpression variable already takes care of data type handling for both columns. Today's behavior is it will do best effort type casting to match source column data type to target, if cast succeeds everything works as expected, otherwise incompatible data type error is thrown.\r\n\r\n### For all other data column types, implicit type casting is allowed and validated.\r\n\r\nSince MIT only requires column type matches for the 3 types of columns, for others spark-hudi did implicit type casting. Tests are written to capture the exhaustive behavior of such handling.\r\n\r\nhandle delete MIT action + exhaustive coverage\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nneed to update the new limitation we impose on MIT\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing metadata metrics to honor metrics prefix. \r\nFix: Will honor the metrics prefix with \"_metadata\" suffixed. \r\n\r\nFor eg, incase of \"clean_duration\" metric:\r\nwith metrics prefix set to \"ohds\":\r\ndata table metric name => \"ohds_clean_duration\" \r\nand metadata metric name => \"ohds_metadata_clean_duration\" \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOne set of metrics for metadata table. \r\n\r\nI could not write an automated tests. But manually verified by using console metrics. \r\n```\r\nohds.timer.deltastreamer\r\nohds_metadata.timer.deltacommit\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to the fix, each metric for metadata will have the table name prefixed w/ metric name. For datatable, still the metircsPrefix was honored. \r\n```\r\nohds.timer.deltastreamer\r\nhoodie_trips_metadata.timer.deltacommit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-06T14:12:23Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T15:59:50Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e24840f4f42ad0d9b543f3100792510f8ab9ab3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615584949,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHQtQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XS","name":"size:XS","color":"384BA7","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nHudi currently is tightly coupled with Avro, particularly in terms of basic data types, schema, and the internal record representation used in read/write paths. This coupling leads to numerous issues, for example, record-level unnecessary Ser/De costs are introduced because of engine specific row and Avro record converting, the data type can not be extended to support other complex/advanced type, such as Variant and the basic read/ write functionality codes cannot be effectively reused among different engines. As for Expression, currently, different engines have their own implementation to achieve pushdown optimization, which is not friendly for extending as more indices are introduced.\r\n\r\nThis RFC aims to propose an improvement to the current Schema/Type/Expression abstractions, to achieve the following goals:\r\n\r\nUse a native schema as the authoritative schema, and make the type system extensible to support or customize other types, e.g, Variant.\r\nAbstract the common implementation of writer/readers and move them to hudi-common module, and engines just need implement getter/setters for specific rows(Flink RowData and Spark InternalRow).\r\nAdd a concentrated and sharable expression abstraction for all kinds of expression pushdown for all engines and integrate it deeply with the MDT indices.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n* Introduce some public API, such as new Schema abstraction.\r\n* Users should see enhanced performance for reading/writing, since redundant Avro Ser/De is eliminated.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

all pending plans too\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nChange `RunCompactionProcedure` op = **scheduleandexecute** to run on all pending instants instead of only scheduled instant.\r\n\r\nThis is to prevent cases when `scheduleandexecute` fails while performing compaction, then rerunning the job again, causing a new compaction plan to be scheduled, and the origjnal plan to be stuck in the pending state. \r\n\r\nIf user triggers this job via an external system that schedules the job on a fixed frequency, such edge cases could happen, and wold require human intervention.\r\n\r\nIf users would like to control the number of plans being executed under `scheduleandexecute` they can still do it with the LIMIT argument, however, compaction execution will always prioritise older instants first, i.e. FIFO ordering.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nNone\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nHudi currently is tightly coupled with Avro, particularly in terms of basic data types, schema, and the internal record representation used in read/write paths. This coupling leads to numerous issues, for example, record-level unnecessary Ser/De costs are introduced because of engine specific row and Avro record converting, the data type can not be extended to support other complex/advanced type, such as Variant and the basic read/ write functionality codes cannot be effectively reused among different engines. As for Expression, currently, different engines have their own implementation to achieve pushdown optimization, which is not friendly for extending as more indices are introduced. \r\n\r\nThis RFC aims to propose an improvement to the current Schema/Type/Expression abstractions, to achieve the following goals:\r\n* Use a native schema as the authoritative schema, and make the type system extensible to support or customize other types, e.g, Variant.\r\n* Abstract the common implementation of writer/readers and move them to hudi-common module, and engines just need implement getter/setters for specific rows(Flink RowData and Spark InternalRow).\r\n* Add a concentrated and sharable expression abstraction for all kinds of expression pushdown for all engines and integrate it deeply with the MDT indices.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nadd an item into the RFCs table\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

So, the sourceReadAndIndexTaggingTimer which tracks the sourceReadAndIndexTagging duration could be started -> and then stopped -> and then again stopped. Had to fix that and move one layer up where we HoodieTimer.start() is called for every batch of write.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixing source read and index tagging duration.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-06T01:02:36Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T02:39:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5709144615e8d64efe0e15ac716ac043fc66609a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdds a check for file inconsistencies when DirectoryInfo is created. On rarest of occasions, due to spark stage/task retires, we could end up w/ two data files for same file group instead of just 1 for a given commit. If a table has such spurious data files and when MDT is initialized, we want to detect such instances and throw a HoodieIOException to not let MDT also result in same inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nAdds a test to verify the change.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo api change.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`BucketIdentifier::getBucketId` excepts `HoodieRecord`, `HoodieKey` and `String recordKey`, but uses only `String recordKey` under the hood. It allows to pass around not necessary data, which decreases performance.\r\n\r\nAnother problem that `BucketIdentifier` method list is really confusing.\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n![1  BucketIdentifier - before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/763bf523-1259-423d-9f51-71a44f47bc45)\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n![2  BucketIdentifier -

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Streams reading from Kafka source can result in **OffsetOutOfRangeException** when trying to read messages that are out of range for a partition. This could happen because messages may expire while the job is progressing due to retention\r\n\r\n- The idea is to get topic retention config and try to move the starting offset forward by some buffer (configurable), to avoid keep losing data due to successive failures\r\n\r\nKafka has time and size based retention but in this PR we are only taking time based retention into account.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo API changes\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNo risk as such as message skipping based on retention only happens if desired config is enabled by the user\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently partition stats avoids data skipping if even one of the query filters has a null, value count based expression. Or if any query uses a complex expression like expression index.\r\nThe jira aims to fix the logic so that index only filters out such queries and performs pruning based on the other queries.\r\nFor example Spark automatically adds query isNotNull on a column like:- isnotnull(driver#869) when an equality query on driver is used. We can ignore such queries for partition stats.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBloom Index causes data skew when bucketized partitioning is used, during repartition and sorting stage when there are hollow buckets created. This happens when there are lot of writes to one partition and few writes to other partitions.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we're partitioning based on the fileId + recordKey sort partitioner which distributes the keys equally while keeping same fileIds together.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-01-17 at 9 29 00 PM (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/362f0321-033f-44ca-b1d2-0a2f64b10032)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBloom Index can now use fileId and recordkey based partitioner to distribute the comparisons equally across partitions where bucketized partitioning is causing data skew.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\nAdded Functional Tests\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static final ConfigProperty<String> BLOOM_INDEX_FILE_GROUP_ID_KEY_SORT_PARTITIONER = ConfigProperty\r\n      .key(\"hoodie.bloom.index.fileId.key.sort.partitioner\")\r\n      .defaultValue(\"false\")\r\n      .markAdvanced()\r\n      .withDocumentation(\"Only applies if index type is BLOOM. \"\r\n          + \"When true, fileId and key sort based partitioning is enabled \"\r\n          + \"This reduces skew seen in bucket based bloom index lookup\");\r\n``` \r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

continue w/ upsert. \r\nL20       .\r\n.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDissecting each fix: \r\n\r\n1. removing lock provider from upgrade code path.\r\n\r\nafter this fix, the control flow is as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\nL1 df.write.format(hudi).save(path) -> say user configured zookeeper based lock provider. \r\n   .\r\nL10   . writeClient.upsert \r\nL11         doInitTable\r\nL12             lock using zookeeper based lock provider\r\nL13                   upgrade\r\nL14                            remove lock provider configs. // fix.\r\nL15                                 rollback failed writes\r\nL16                                 full table compaction \r\nL17                                 // but we did notice again re-entrancy was happening \r\nL18               unlock\r\nL19        continue w/ upsert. \r\nL20       .\r\n.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. We were automatically overriding the LockProvider to InProcessLock provider if its a single writer and all inline table services (at L15). So, essentially if we configure InProcessLockProvider from end user standpoint, we were hitting re-entrant locks. Fix: Made this logic to be guarded by the auto adjust lock config (hoodie.auto.adjust.lock.configs). So, no auto adjustment of lock configs will take place for straight forward out of the box use-case. \r\n\r\nAgain, we were still hitting the exception. \r\n\r\n3. TransactionManager is the entity used for regular locking mechanism (lock while scheduling compaction, locking while writing to MDT etc) in hudi. But the new instant time generation takes a diff route and has its down lock provider. So, both of them have different ways to deduce the default. \r\n\r\nTransactionManager was explicitly setting the lock provider to InProcessLockProvider if there is no LockProvider configured. If user configures explicitly, txnManager re-uses the same. \r\n\r\nIntroducing NoopLockProvider which just allows anyone to acquire the lock (synonymous to single writer). So, for UpgradeHandler code blocks, we override the lock provider to use NoopLockProvider. \r\n\r\nafter this fix, the control flow is as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\nL1 df.write.format(hudi).save(path) -> say user configured zookeeper based lock provider. \r\n   .\r\nL10   . writeClient.upsert \r\nL11         doInitTable\r\nL12             lock using zookeeper based lock provider\r\nL13                   upgrade\r\nL14                            override lock provider to NoopLockProvider\r\nL15                                 rollback failed writes\r\nL16                                 full table compaction \r\nL17                                 // we were again hitting the issue still.\r\nL18               unlock\r\nL19        continue w/ upsert. \r\nL20       .\r\n.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven w/ above fix, we were still hitting re-entrant locks. \r\n\r\n4. We use a cache for TimeGenerator instances, one per table path. Again, in the above flow of events, even if we override the LP to NoopLockProvider, new instant time generation was using the same lock provider as user configured one. Reason was, we re-use the same TimeGenerator which was generated before the upgrade call. So, introduced an internal config named \"_hoodie.time.generator.reuse.enable\". By default we enable it. In the upgrade flows, we override it to false. And so, we create new instance of TimeGenerator. This means that, the lock provider used by the TimeGenerator will use NoopLockProvider as configured. \r\n\r\nSo, w/ all of above 3 fixes, our solution is as follows\r\n\r\n```\r\nL1 df.write.format(hudi).save(path) -> say user configured zookeeper based lock provider. \r\n   .\r\nL10   . writeClient.upsert \r\nL11         doInitTable\r\nL12             lock using zookeeper based lock provider\r\nL13                   upgrade\r\nL14                            override lock provider to NoopLockProvider, disable auto adjust lock configs, disable reuse time generator\r\nL15                                 rollback failed writes\r\nL16                                 full table compaction \r\nL17                                 both of the above operations will not try to re-acquire the lock again using user configured LP(i.e zookeeper based lock provider). here we use NoopLockProvider. \r\nL18               unlock\r\nL19        continue w/ upsert. \r\nL20       .\r\n.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSeamless upgrade irrespective of lock provider used. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- After removing defaut lock provider in https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/63ad659a672d9be23a87a1bc85731b66529cd3be, we need to still set a lock for instant time geenration. See changes in `HoodieWriteConfig`.\r\n- Lock requirement for transaction manager can change from within a transaction. For example, when a compaction is scheduled during upgrade, the lock requirement is set to false. Make `isLockRequired` non-final and provide a setter.\r\n- `TransacationManager`'s isLockRequired is set in `BaseHoodieClient#updateColumnsToIndexWithColStats` which is called before beginTransaction and then lock requirements are reset after the job within transaction is done.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSet transaction manager lock requirement based on config\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

It requires an extra ser/de operations not only between Flink operators (will be fixed by RFC-84).\r\n\r\nI decided to benchmark a POC version with native Flink's RowData writer for Hudi. It was simple enough, because Hudi already has native RowData to Parquet writer used by append mode, I reused this writer to create log blocks and two bottlenecks were found:\r\n\r\n1. Hudi performs a lot of **Avro ser/de operations** in writer runtime.\r\n\r\n2. Hudi stores Avro recrods as List<HoodieRecord>, it causes a **GC pressure** on writer runtime, on my benchmarks garbage collection is about 30% of all hudi writer runtime.\r\n\r\n![profiler](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79e5eda8-f041-4974-ac61-3415f874922b)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs a result I reduced write time from ~4min to ~1min 20sec (**x3 write performance boost**):\r\n\r\n![results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b8555da-b977-4d39-9dbb-23c3a41f6340)\r\n\r\nI have a POC version we are already testing in our cloud environment, key improvements:\r\n\r\n1. This POC **based on RFC-84** and already contains POC from RFC-84\r\n2. Write native RowData to parquet log blocks (**eliminate unnecessary ser/de**)\r\n4. Recrods are stored in BinaryInMemorySortBuffer (**reduce GC pressure**)\r\n5. Records are sorted by new QuickSort().sort(sortBuffer) before writing log block (maybe it's possible to preform data compaction without sorting? this sort performs fast enough so it doesn't affect write performance.)\r\n6. RowDataStreamWriteFunction flushes bucket async (**reduces preciding operators backpressure**)\r\n\r\n#### My config\r\n\r\nPC: 32CPU 128GiB\r\nData: 60 million records of TPC-H lineitem

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUse payload to do merging inside of expression payload.\r\nIf your tables payload was overwrite with latest, and you did MIT, it would use ordering field if defined. Now we will use the actual payload.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFor MIT update, the payload would be honored. For delete it still does not honor the payload logic. Today's behavior is it will always delete even using event ordering and incoming record precombine field value is smaller.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. There can be performance hit for customized payload since we use reflection for every record.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes record merge mode related issues and improves test coverage in Spark SQL:\r\n- Table version 6 does not have record merge mode in the table config.  The file group reader is changed to infer the record merge mode if it does not exist in the table config, so it can read Hudi table of version 6.\r\n- For INSERT INTO in Spark SQL, the write config of record merge mode is not properly determined in `buildHoodieInsertConfig`.  The relevant logic is removed since the SQL writer can automatically get the correct write config of record merge mode from the table config.\r\n- In MERGE INTO in Spark SQL, the record merge mode check is fixed to avoid NPE.\r\n- More tests are added in `TestMergeModeCommitTimeOrdering` and `TestMergeModeEventTimeOrdering` to coverage different cases of merge modes and both table version 6 and 8.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBug fixes on record merge mode related issues and improvement on test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nChanges in Flink stream write into Hudi table with simple bucket index corresponding to [RFC-84](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12697).\r\n\r\n#### Benchmark description\r\n\r\n`Lineitem` table from TPC-H benchmark was used. 60 mln rows, from which 20 mln rows are unique.\r\n\r\n#### Perfomance estimation results\r\n\r\n|

serialization costs estimation, we search for `KryoSerializer::serialize` and `TupleSerializer::serialize` correspondingly in the first Flink operator. For deserialization costs, we search for `KryoSerializer::deserialize` and `TupleSerializer::deserialize` in the second Flink operator.\r\n\r\n#### Flink operators\r\n\r\nCurrent with Kryo:\r\n\r\n![0 operators - 1 usual](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2718464f-b971-46d0-b0dd-984452edeeb8)\r\n\r\nAfter switch to `HoodieFlinkRecord`:\r\n\r\n![0 operators - 3 HoodieFlinkRecord](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d407d1-5c55-43f1-ad7c-7bf3ff27f927)\r\n\r\n#### Flame graph\r\n\r\nCurrent with Kryo:\r\n\r\n![1 flame graph - 1 usual](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c0c21eb-68de-41ef-83fc-e6e534c87cd8)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter switch to `HoodieFlinkRecord`:\r\n\r\n![1 flame graph - 3 HoodieFlinkRecord](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f69c5b8-f68f-4ae2-ab99-ef7327eb3b75)\r\n\r\n#### Extra conversion\r\n\r\nThere is an additional intermediate conversion into Avro `GenericRecord` in `RowDataEnrichFunction::enrichRowData` to support all current key generators, because they are hardly coupled with `GenericRecord`. These costs could be accepted for now due to acceptable values: 5 798 CPU samples from 183 236 in total, which is about 3%.\r\n\r\n![4 extra cost - 3

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Use payload to do merging inside of expression payload.\r\n- Change hierarchy - make ExpressionPayload extend from BaseAvroPayload instead of DefaultHoodieRecordPayload.\r\n- Add test for merge into covering all merge modes.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There is still per record overhead of reflection in case of CUSTOM merge mode. I am not sure how to avoid that given the construction of payload is tightly coupled to the record itself. Maybe we can use record merger API where merger can be instantiated upfront, and the merge methods take both old and new incoming record as arguments.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMERGE INTO command honors different merge modes.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPlease start reviewing from commit with title \"basic code refactor\". All previous commits comes from https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12688. Or alternatively, you can review [this](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12718/files/2a2142943e6ba8cbf67cbe2a883046cd268284d7..6266ac5177790c8ffa6325916e5e212d9c34532d).\r\n\r\nThe change is about how we handle checkpoint override configurations for delta streamer with hoodie incremental source during auto upgrade:\r\n- Initially we are in table version 6\r\n- Turn on auto upgrade and set checkpoint override would leads to ingestion failure with user friendly error message.\r\n- Auto upgrade without checkpoint related config override (--checkpoint and --ignore-checkpoint) will succeed.\r\n- After upgrading to table version 8, --checkpoint for hoodie incremental source must be compliant with format \r\n```\r\nresumeFromInstantRequestTime: <checkpoint>\r\n```\r\nfor request time based checkpoint reset. Internally delta streamer for hoodie incremental source would convert this to the completion time of the same instant and start ingestion following completion time based ordering. Alternatively, user can reset checkpoint based on completion time using:\r\n```\r\nresumeFromInstantCompletionTime: <checkpoint>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note, the config only controls the way of how checkpoint is overridden, delta streamer always follow the completion time based handing for version 8 target hoodie tables.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoid corner case that user/hudi confuse checkpoint semantics during auto upgrade.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nAfter hoodie incremental source can support completion time based checkpoint, we should update the doc about these rules. As of now, the hoodie incremental sources are still using request time based handling in 1.x.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-28T00:23:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T19:16:49Z","closed_at":"2025-01-29T05:09:48Z","merged_at":"2025-01-29T05:09:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"0a0f3bbea26e1464b72fb2bd5a6db17eccda97cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR
