for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips. After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/basic-block-normal-form/5908/5, the requirements for basic block normal form are:\r\n- D0, Define a block as a group of expressions implied by the scope structure.\r\n- D1: Each graph node can only belong to a single block\r\n- D2: For values that are being used in multiple blocks, they have to be referred by a Var which is defined in a block\r\n\r\nWe rely on `analysis::DependencyGraph` to compute the dependency among nodes, and use LCA to compute the scope of each node. As we traverse the dependency graph, we record the expression with a \"lifted scope\" if its original scope is different from the result of LCA of nodes depending on it. For instance, a variable shared by the true_branch and false_branch in an `If` statement. If any expression with lifted scope is found, the function violates the basic block normal form. \r\n\r\nThe expressions with lifted scope need to be bound by let binding. It is done with a pass almost the same as the ANF pass. Same as ANF we use a let list per scope to help construct let bindings of expressions. The main difference with ANF pass is that we only push expressions to the let list if the expression's scope is lifted, otherwise we return the original expression. When we come across If/function node, we get the expression generated from the let list of the corresponding scope. \r\n\r\n\r\n@MarisaKirisame would you suggest we merge the two passes into a single class?

any extra attributes of the llvm target are not being passed through to LLVMModule during `ModulePackImportsToLLVM`. This will cause compilation to fail with `error: /tmp/tmpctakbpk1/devc.o uses VFP register arguments, output does not` when the target is opencl and the target_host requires `-mfloat-abi=soft`. This regression was introduced by #4657.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why:\r\n1. `python/tvm/runtime/module.py` uses \"_get_target_triple\" to get the target triple to use for `ModulePackImportsToLLVM`. However, the implementation of that function returns `tm_->getTargetTriple().str()` which will only have the standard `<arch><sub>-<vendor>-<sys>-<abi>` and is missing any extra flags or attributes such as `-mfloat-abi=soft`.\r\n2. Since the module was created by CodegenBlob, it doesn't store anything in the \"tvm_target\" module metadata and therefore `module_->getTargetTriple()` is called which again doesn't have the extra flags and attributes: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/src/target/llvm/llvm_module.cc#L254 \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes those problems by:\r\n1. Adding important attributes back into  `_get_target_triple` (only mfloat-abi for now). This part doesn't seem ideal to me. Any thoughts on how to improve? Can we store the user's full target string earlier on?\r\n2. Saving full target triple string in \"tvm_target\" module metadata flag during `CodeGenBlob` so that `LLVMModuleNode::Init(std::unique_ptr<llvm::Module> module, std::shared_ptr<llvm::LLVMContext> ctx)` can retrieve it: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/src/target/llvm/llvm_module.cc#L247 This matches what `LLVMModuleNode::Init(const IRModule& mod, std::string target)` already does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscuss post: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/opencl-target-for-32-bit-arm-linux-android-broken-after-pr-4657/7252\r\nFixes

PR adds a `--runtime` attr to the `c` and `llvm` targets. `--runtime` is expected to be `c` or `c++` currently, and this option specifies the way in which generated modules handle function lookup. in the c++ case, global initializer functions may be called (system lib) or the symbol table may be consulted by `library_module.cc`. in the c case, a [FuncRegistry](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/include/tvm/runtime/crt/func_registry.h#L41) is generated and an explicit initialization hook `TVMSystemLibEntryPoint` is defined. \r\n\r\ncurrently, this PR only supports generating system libs for the C runtime, but the functionality is split into two pieces so that it's clear what would need to be addressed to support a form of dynamically-linked C libs. much of this PR is written assuming a bare metal environment (explicit initializer, function lookup table in flash, no presumed use of dlopen, etc), so a \"dynamically-linked\" solution would ideally support that environment as well.\r\n\r\nthis PR is in service of [MISRA-C changes for RPC support](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-misra-c-changes-for-rpc-support/7098) RFC; if you think it deserves its own RFC, I'm happy to write one up.","created_at":"2020-07-27T16:25:48Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T00:29:43Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T23:08:20Z","merged_at":"2020-08-06T23:08:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b485d478f280938cebf5d3072a4420c2cef56c6e","assignee":{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

This patch adds a new member to ReduceNode called init which allows\r\n  initialization with a custom ProducerLoad or a Float/Int immediate.\r\n- This allows initialization of the output Tensor of a reduction with\r\n  another Tensor instead of the `identity_element` defined in the\r\n  CommReducer\r\n- One example use case for this node is to initialize the Output of a\r\n  convolution reduction with the Bias values thereby saving the\r\n  Bias-add computation.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

pull request is to replace the current grouped direct convolution algorithm on x86 and Arm targets, with the faster Grouped Spatial Pack Convolutions (GSPC) algorithm.\r\n\r\nHere's a performance

groups:\r\n![tvm_PR_hikey_1thr_ResNet34_tex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16022573/88482105-1f276000-cf57-11ea-94a5-69a28c37ffef.png)\r\n\r\nNote that in the untuned case the current depthwise convolution outperforms GSPC, thus I have omitted it from the pull request.\r\n\r\nThis is my first proper full request to TVM, so I may be have some issues I haven't spotted, or style

we make `conv2d_cudnn.cuda` and `dense_cublas.cuda` as AutoTVM tasks so that they can be \"tuned\" and compared with other implementations, there have some issues prevent us from actually \"tuning\" them.\r\n\r\n- `conv2d_cudnn.cuda`: I constantly got the following errors in `cudnnFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm` (on T4 GPU). Note that this function is called when extracting tasks without issues. I guess it might be the issue of CUDA context and threading.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cuDNN: Check failed: e == CUDNN_STATUS_SUCCESS (2 vs. 0) : CUDNN_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n   The solution in this PR is to create a knob so that it becomes a template with 8 candidates. In this case, `cudnnFindConvolutionForwardAlgorithm` will not be called during tuning and everything works well. We still set the knob value to `-1` in the fallback config to achieve the same behavoir as now.\r\n\r\n- `dense_cblas.cuda`: The error comes from the callback function that tries to display the FLOPS. The reason is that `task.flops` is `FloatImm` instead of `float`, so `float(flops)` will throw type error. This PR lets `add_flop` function support `FloatImm` and `IntImm` types.\r\n\r\ncc @icemelon9 @merrymercy

`autotvm.task.task.TaskTemplate.get_inputs`\r\n\r\nDue to the hack term [here]( https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/0a1c4c2174e1c4a04ca6e40cd90cdf7c2ef1d90a/topi/python/topi/mali/conv2d.py#L323), both tensor `output` and tensor `Y` point to the same tensor `M`, which causes tensor `M` to be added in the queue twice. Using a hash set can remove duplicate nodes when performing level order traversal. @comaniac @kevinthesun @merrymercy

is related to #5840 and split from PR #5842 \r\n\r\nOriginally, device type is propagated based on the post DFS traversed graph, which may not be consistent if the argument order changes. In addition, it may handle some cases wrongly, e.g., the first residual block in Resnet50. The first few layers in Resnet50 are depicted in the following figure (top to bottom is in DFS order). Basically, we want to let all the layers run on FPGA device, except the first and last few layers. In the original device propagation algorithm, based on the post DFS order, the conv2d layers in grey will be propagated with `CPU` device type as we encounter `copy2` first, following which the three grey conv2d nodes are marked as the source device type of `copy2` (i.e., `CPU`), which is not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img

PR cleans up conversions between TVM's `Function` and Rust functions.\r\n\r\nThe `ToBoxedFn` trait is removed entirely, replaced by standard `From` implementations.\r\nThe `ToFunction` and `Typed` traits have more logic, so they stay, but I've added the following: \r\n- Remove some cloning\r\n- Don't panic if number of args is wrong, return an error\r\n- Actually drop functions/closures on the rust side\r\n\r\nI've also macro-ified some impls to make them easier to maintain, and I've added some tests to the function conversion logic that checks error handling.","created_at":"2020-07-22T18:53:06Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T08:14:19Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T08:14:19Z","merged_at":"2020-07-23T08:14:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"06d756563d805e8a12dac84c6372071f35457e4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/490bbb898cd8aa86e52c92de45b20acade975d39","head":{"label":"mwillsey:rust-cleanup","ref":"rust-cleanup","sha":"490bbb898cd8aa86e52c92de45b20acade975d39","user":{"login":"mwillsey","id":1783756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODM3NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1783756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey","html_url":"https://github.com/mwillsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":281728835,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODE3Mjg4MzU=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"mwillsey/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mwillsey","id":1783756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODM3NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1783756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey","html_url":"https://github.com/mwillsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwillsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mwillsey/incubator-tvm","description":"Open

3.8 changes the default way multiprocessing creates new processes on macOS from forking to spawing. Spawning requires all objects to be picklable. Nested functions and lambdas are not picklable, so this commit fixes the one instance of nested functions in the codebase that was causing issues.\r\n\r\nAlthough I've fixed the error from objects not being picklable, I'm getting an error in `tests/python/unittest/test_autotvm_measure.py` where registered tasks aren't found. Looking in `python/tvm/autotvm/measure/local_executor.py`, the global `TASK_TABLE` is empty in some child processes. The error only occurs with python 3.8 and pytest. Running  `tests/python/unittest/test_autotvm_measure.py` directly (without pytest) gives no errors. I'd assume this issue is related to multiprocessing.","created_at":"2020-07-17T00:01:20Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T14:51:26Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T14:51:13Z","merged_at":"2020-07-17T14:51:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"378a85a896ca3393b9e86cdc87fcc0ed76c1ec82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

when we want to compile and execute a network with dynamic input, only using `llvm` target can work as expected. \r\n\r\nIf the target is as `CUDA`, the compilation part works fine, but the run part fails. The reason why this happens is that the shape functions dealing with dynamic inputs are normally built on target host like `llvm`, while the output tensors of shape functions need to locate on gpu target. Therefore, in the PR, I try to fix this bug by creating temporary output tensors on cpu for results of shape functions and coping them to the output tensors created by the vm located on gpu.","created_at":"2020-07-16T09:12:33Z","updated_at":"2020-07-17T05:33:19Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T05:33:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7632bd2af821a6022ade9edc1fd17317f860508","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/769861db38041e49f8551c57e71a1c79569f2f07","head":{"label":"lsy643:dynamic_cuda_vm","ref":"dynamic_cuda_vm","sha":"769861db38041e49f8551c57e71a1c79569f2f07","user":{"login":"lsy643","id":7875729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzU3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7875729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643","html_url":"https://github.com/lsy643","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275760107,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU3NjAxMDc=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"lsy643/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lsy643","id":7875729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzU3Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7875729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643","html_url":"https://github.com/lsy643","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsy643/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lsy643/incubator-tvm","description":"Open

PR enables the invocation of accelerator specific optimization flow to make BYOC consistent to TVM compilation flow. For example, we separate the optimization and codegen. Optimization is now invoked when a function is partitioned, and codegen only focuses on generating the needed runtime module. This is needed by libraries such as ARM compute library in #5915 \r\n\r\nNote that we now have explicitly registered various type of APIs for the BYOC flow and implicitly invoke them to accomplish the end-to-end flow. It would require users/vendors to change multiple places for registration. @jroesch also has a concern for this. @comaniac Lets think of a way to centralize the APIs and make an RFC.\r\n\r\n@masahi

there, this PR is a minor modification to CombineParallelDense pass, refer to https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/yet-another-dense-op-combine-strategy/7126. The changes are:\r\n\r\n-  Add option \"to_batch\" (default to True) to control whether combine dense ops into `batch_matmul` or `dense`. \r\n\r\n- Add implementation to combine dense ops into one large `dense` instead of `batch_matmul`, which take almost same logic with that of `CombineParallelConv2D` pass.\r\n\r\n- Test cases for combine various shapes of elem-wise op followed.\r\n\r\n- The new strategy can combine even ops of different output dims and may take better performance in circumstances where flat matmul operation is faster than equivalent batch_matmul operation.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-15T07:31:46Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T02:05:39Z","closed_at":"2020-08-07T07:29:38Z","merged_at":"2020-08-07T07:29:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3c42f9478f11c2fb361e89266ba2046a0ba063d","assignee":{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MarisaKirisame","id":3397377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTczNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3397377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame","html_url":"https://github.com/MarisaKirisame","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarisaKirisame/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/48cd48a51aa952024d6ff5a8525d6f63e25e69b6","head":{"label":"4paradigm:feat/SupportAnotherDenseCombineStrategy","ref":"feat/SupportAnotherDenseCombineStrategy","sha":"48cd48a51aa952024d6ff5a8525d6f63e25e69b6","user":{"login":"4paradigm","id":24433472,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0NDMzNDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24433472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm","html_url":"https://github.com/4paradigm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":224627385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjQ2MjczODU=","name":"canopy","full_name":"4paradigm/canopy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"4paradigm","id":24433472,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0NDMzNDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24433472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm","html_url":"https://github.com/4paradigm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/4paradigm/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","sit

fully_connected converter used the shapes from the TFLite model to reshape the data tensor. However, the TFLite model shapes do not reflect those provided by the `data_shape` parameter in `from_tflite()`. The TFLite model shape `input_tensor.tensor.ShapeAsNumpy()` will give a batch size of `1` because the TFLite model obviously doesn't know about the `data_shape` dict the user provided to the relay importer.\r\n\r\nFor this particular op, the reshape can always be set to `(-1, n_units)` without needing to calculate a batch size.\r\n\r\nFor inceptionv4, without this PR we would incorrectly compute a batch size of 1 adding this reshape from %515: `(4, 1, 1, 1536)` to %516: `(1, 1536)`. This ultimately causes the model output to become `(1, 1001)` instead of `(4, 1001)`\r\n```\r\n  ..\r\n  %515 = nn.avg_pool2d(%514, pool_size=[8, 8], padding=[0, 0, 0, 0], layout=\"NHWC\") /* ty=Tensor[(4, 1, 1, 1536), float32] */;                                          \r\n  %516 = reshape(%515, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(2), int32] */ /* ty=Tensor[(2), int32] */, newshape=[1, 1536]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1536), float32] */;\r\n  %517 = nn.dense(%516, %v_param_299, units=None) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1001), float32] */;                                                                                  \r\n  %518 = nn.bias_add(%517, %v_param_300) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1001), float32] */;                        \r\n  nn.softmax(%518, axis=1) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 1001), float32] */                                                                                                          \r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nBtw, should the reshape op have some validation to prevent reshapes where the numbers of elements don't match? `(4, 1, 1, 1536)` -> `(1, 1536)` shouldn't be valid.","created_at":"2020-07-10T18:40:16Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T01:13:00Z","closed_at":"2020-07-14T01:12:29Z","merged_at":"2020-07-14T01:12:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"99c52f390211b72d1dbf85a68d6e99db6771e239","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6038/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6038/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6038/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d5d6ec10b28c45049fdecef402f6b3922d94f14a","head":{"label":"trevor-m:fix-tflite-fc-batch","ref":"fix-tflite-fc-batch","sha":"d5d6ec10b28c45049fdecef402f6b3922d94f14a","user":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":204561313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDQ1NjEzMTM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"trevor-m/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm","description":"Open
