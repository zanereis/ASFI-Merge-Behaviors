These details are logged at the INFO level but seem more appropriate for debugging.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to clean up this connection logging a little. The INFO level logging will contain only the connection ID that is used while the details of the connection are changed to the DEBUG level (and still masked). Additionally the connection ID info is logged regardless of the provided connection attrs (i.e. removing the `host` check). Lastly this change also has a small added benefit of not accidentally or unknowingly exposing connection info that users do not want in their logs _first_ rather than the details be exposed and then having to setup configuration to mask them later (assuming the exposure is noticed at all).\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

What\r\n\r\nAdd opt-in in `SQSSensor` to disable the behavior of automatically delete messages on consumption. This option is opt-in. By default it is set to `False`, which means the original feature is preserved.\r\n\r\n- If `delete_message_on_reception` is `True` (default): SQS messages are deleted automatically from the queue upon consumption.\r\n- If `delete_message_on_reception` is `False`. The user takes care of message deletion manually.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nIn many cases, the `SQSSensor` itselft is not the part of the code base that actually processes the messages. It serves as a short of polling to get messages out for further processing.\r\n\r\nIf the actually code/Aiflow task that processes the messages failed, the message should be put back in the queue for further processing. This is the very basic idea of SQS Polling provided by Amazon.\r\n\r\nReference to SQS with AWS Lambda function, [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html) states :\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen your function *successfully* processes a batch, Lambda deletes its messages from the queue.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn many case, the `SQSSensor` polls the message and distributes the workload to different task, in a very similar way to AWS Lambda polling.\r\n\r\n![SQSPolling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6369285/151395485-f277165b-7ec2-42ca-880f-6cd74879c1d6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, there should be option to disable to default behavior, which is to delete the message upon reception.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-27T15:58:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T08:06:01Z","closed_at":"2022-01-29T08:05:59Z","merged_at":"2022-01-29T08:05:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ae156fd29b446332939eb142b68ecd80ee8b999","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20443 we added TaskListener API. It's contract promises to pass TaskInstance object to listener plugin. However, what happens is not 100% true - the object being passed is one that maps to current SQLAlchemy session.\r\n\r\n`check_and_change_state_before_execution` operates on detached TaskInstance object, then merges it to current session. Since there is no attached object in the SQLAlchemy identity map, SQLAlchemy creates it, and it's this object that's being passed to the SQLAlchemy event listeners.\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is that when creating new SQLAlchemy object, SQLAlchemy takes care about setting only database-mapped fields. The ones that are purely on the python side, like `task` aren't being set on the new object.\r\n\r\nThis PR manually sets `task` on the new SQLAlchemy object, so that `on_task_instance_running` receives proper TaskInstance with `task` field set.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Maciej Obuchowski

testing examples of images in python\r\n\r\n01. **Change the script to python and eliminate unnecessary scripts:**\r\n     - airflow/docker_tests/test-examples-of-prod-image-building.sh to  airflow/docker_tests/test-examples-of-prod-image-building.py\r\n     - Removed the call to scripts/ci/images/ci_run_docker_tests.sh\r\n02. **Added working-directory to build other dependencies of test examples prod:**\r\n     - The script is running in his directory: `DOCKER_EXAMPLES_DIR = SOURCE_ROOT / \"docs\" / \"docker-stack\" / \"docker-examples\"`, so it is necesary specify the working-directory in ci.yaml in the same directory to complete the call of more dependencies.\r\n     - Added \"requests\" as a requirement in setup.cfg, this is importing in the final script:` import requests`\r\n\r\nRelated to: \r\n- PR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20913\r\n- TASK: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/20254\r\n\r\n\r\nClose: #20254

deletes any previous Spark Application with the same name**\r\n\r\n**Current issue**:\r\nIf a Spark App is being launched you either have to template the name inside the yaml file (making it unique with a timestamp) or need to delete the previous run of the Spark App in order to prevent failure. Especially for newcomers to the topic this quickly leads to errors by design of the operator.\r\n\r\n**Open Questions**:\r\nI am wondering if we should delete the K8 Spark Application after a successful run as well from inside the Operator. Or at least provide a flag to enable this. \r\n_Downsides_: Harder to debug since container is gone in case of errors (or we keep the container if it failed)\r\n_Upsides_: Less polluted K8 Cluster with old Spark Apps.\r\n\r\nI would love to get some input on these thoughts.\r\n\r\n**Minor Updates**:\r\nAs far as I could tell the docstring was not correct. You can only pass a String or Dict as `application_file` . The name of the parameter would need to be changed from my point of view as well. But since this is my first PR here, I did not want to introduce a breaking change to an Operator right away. But if someone makes sure I am doing this the right way, I am happy to adjust.\r\n\r\ncloses:

to execute functions in k8s using KubernetesPodOperator\r\n\r\ncloses: #19135\r\n```\r\n@task.kubernetes(image='python:3.8-slim-buster', name='k8s_test', namespace='default')\r\ndef k8s_decorator_func():\r\n       print(\"decorator func\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no parameters passed, defaults are set in kubernetes.py\r\n```\r\n        # Image, name and namespace are all required.\r\n        if not 'image' in kwargs:\r\n            kwargs['image'] = 'python:3.8-slim-buster'\r\n\r\n        if not 'name' in kwargs:\r\n            kwargs['name'] =

variable - __PYTHON_SCRIPT__ and in the command , the logic is to retrieve the environment variable and write to '/tmp/script.py' to execute the function(very similar to Docker)\r\n\r\n1) Initially proceeded with trying to mount a local file using the hostPath, the problem is that requires Airflow also to run in the same node. For example running airflow locally and connecting to the kind cluster would need a mount.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#19047, #19052\r\nCloses: #12876\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to improve both the handling of `template_fields` values declared as strings (most typically seen as `template_fields = (\"some_field\")` as well as the error message for declaring `template_fields` that are not attributes of the operator.  In the first case, a warning is logged and the `template_fields` is \"automagically\" converted to a list for the task execution. For the second case, the error message is updated from the default `AttributeError` to something more specific to what is happening when attempting to render any template fields.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

It did not change the\r\nbehaviour of the UPDATE query. The \"with_row_lock\" clause\r\nadds \"FOR UPDATE\" clause to SELECT queries but it is\r\nsilently ignored by SQLAlchemy for UPDATE queries because\r\nUPDATE queries obtain row locks automatically.\r\n\r\nAs the result, this change did not change Airflow Behaviour\r\nbut added \"noise\" around the query.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

If i were to try to use a connection without it, it would error out asking for basic authentication or a trino user. If i add a username and password to a connection. The connection becomes encrypted and is added to secrets then i won't be able to discover it unless i go through the basehook.\r\n\r\nconn = BaseHook.get_connection(kwargs['my_conn_id'])\r\n\r\nThere are flaws in both systems that causes the inconsistency with the TrinoHook when using Basic Authentication. This will allow a connection from secrets to be passed to TrinoHook but will not fix the problem with TrinoHook Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication will not work with a Http connection and Airflow does not allow you to send a https connection without using a uri.\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead

If i were to try to use a connection without it, it would error out asking for basic authentication or a trino user. If i add a username and password to a connection. The connection becomes encrypted and is added to secrets then i won't be able to discover it unless i go through the basehook.\r\n\r\nconn = BaseHook.get_connection(kwargs['my_conn_id'])\r\n\r\nThere are flaws in both systems that causes the inconsistency with the TrinoHook when using Basic Authentication. This will allow a connection from secrets to be passed to TrinoHook but will not fix the problem with TrinoHook Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication will not work with a Http connection and Airflow does not allow you to send a https connection without using a uri.\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead

\"wait_for_image\" was called, the information that the image\r\nwas built (including the information about md5 hashes of important\r\nfiles) had not been stored locally. It was only stored when\r\nimage was pulled by \"prepare_image\". Constraints job uses\r\nwait for image, because it runs in parallel for all python versions.\r\n\r\nWith recent changes, the flag that image had never been built,\r\nautomatically generates image build - unnecessarily, because the\r\nimage is already pulled by \"wait_for_image\".\r\n\r\nIt made almost no difference for \"regular builds\" because the image\r\nis rebuilt from cache (which is now very quick) but in case of\r\nPRs that change setup.py it caused image rebuild. Additionally if\r\nthis iamge has conflicting requirement, it would cause build failure.\r\n\r\nThe change simply registers the fact that image is \"ok\" so that\r\nno attempt to rebuild image happens when constraints are generated.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds a new provider to interface with [dbt Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-overview) via the [dbt Cloud API](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cloud/api-v2).  The provider includes:\r\n\r\n- `DbtCloudHook` which implements an abstraction for almost all of the available endpoints in the dbt Cloud API and inherits from the existing `HttpHook`.\r\n- Two operators, `DbtCloudRunJobOperator` and `DbtCloudGetJobRunArtifactOperator`, which triggers a dbt Cloud job and downloads a run artifact, respectively.\r\n- A sensor, `DbtCloudJobRunSensor`, to poll status of a specific dbt Cloud job run.\r\n- An operator link to allow users to navigate directly to the triggered dbt Cloud job run for monitoring.\r\n- A `test_connection()` method in the `DbtCloudHook` for users to test connections prior to executing DAGs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

that when AUFS is a backing storage for Docker, changing\r\nthe script to executable and executing it right after during the\r\nbuild phase might cause an error: 'text file busy'\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/moby/moby/issues/13594\r\n\r\nWorkaround for that is to add extra `sync` command after changing\r\nthe executable flag to make sure that the filesystem change has\r\npropageted to the underlying AUFS storage.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the sync and also makes sure that both CI And PROD\r\nimage use same formatting, executable bits and `&&` between\r\ncommands rather than `;`. The `&&` is better to separate the\r\ncommands because it will not continue with execution steps in the\r\nsame bash command after previous command fails. This caused\r\nconfusion as to what is the reason for docker build failure.\r\n\r\nThe problem was raised in the #20971 discussion.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
