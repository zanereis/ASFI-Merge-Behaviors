This is similar to Inner, Left Semi and Existence (a specialized left semi) join. The problem is that this changes the semantics of the join; a left anti join filters out rows that matches the join condition.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by only pushing down conditions to the left hand side of the join. This is similar to the behavior of left outer join.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `FilterPushdownSuite.scala` and created a SQLQueryTestSuite file for left anti joins with a regression test.","created_at":"2016-11-28T00:30:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T19:50:41Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T15:13:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4077a641905975b69f67e40155346e1fb6dc1660","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47bbdffdc78ce72b4b1b9cdf0d4ce139d04e16fa","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-18597","ref":"SPARK-18597","sha":"47bbdffdc78ce72b4b1b9cdf0d4ce139d04e16fa","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains updates to Scala and Java Accumulator code snippets in the programming guide. \r\n\r\n- For Scala, the pull request fixes the signature of the 'add()' method in the custom Accumulator, which contained two params (as the old AccumulatorParam) instead of one (as in AccumulatorV2). \r\n\r\n- The Java example was updated to use the AccumulatorV2 class since AccumulatorParam is marked as deprecated.  \r\n\r\n- Scala and Java examples are more consistent now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested manually by building the docs locally.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6235869/20652099/77d98d18-b4f3-11e6-8565-a995fe8cf8e5.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-27T22:00:17Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T13:52:15Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T13:52:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"140ff228059651a41ecaf2538d1ddb6a159d06ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0366a3c77957ae9a6f7d9a92581ed3b9af430c62","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:fixed_accumulator_example","ref":"fixed_accumulator_example","sha":"0366a3c77957ae9a6f7d9a92581ed3b9af430c62","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

Spectral LDA algorithm transforms the LDA problem to an orthogonal tensor decomposition problem. [[Anandkumar 2012]] establishes theoretical guarantee for the convergence of orthogonal tensor decomposition.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm first builds 2nd-order, 3rd-order moments from the empirical word counts, orthogonalize them and finally perform the tensor decomposition on the empirical data moments. The whole procedure is purely linear and could leverage machine native BLAS/LAPACK libraries (the Spark needs to be compiled with `-Pnetlib-lgpl` option).\r\n\r\nIt achieves competitive log-perplexity vs Online Variational Inference in the shortest time. It also has clean memory usage – as of v2.0.0 we've experienced crash due to memory problem with the built-in Gibbs Sampler or Online Variational Inference, but never with the Spectral LDA algorithm. This algorithm is linearly scalable.\r\n\r\nThe official repo is at https://github.com/FurongHuang/SpectralLDA-TensorSpark. We refactored for the Spark coding style and interfaces when porting over for the PR. We wrote a report describing the algorithm in detail and listing test results at https://www.overleaf.com/read/wscdvwrjmtmw. It's going to enter our official repo soon.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\nAnandkumar, Anima, et al., Tensor decompositions for learning latent variable models, 2012,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`JavaTypeInference#inferDataType` used a different bean property filter from `serializerFor` and `deserializerFor`. While `inferDataType` required properties to simple not be named \"class\", the others require properties to have associated accessor and mutator. This caused an inconsistency in the `ExpressionEncoder`, resulting in an `AssertionError` when Datasets are operated on. (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18598)\r\n\r\nThe PR patches `JavaTypeInference` to _always_ require properties to have an associated accessor and mutator.\r\n\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Apache Spark 1.6.x, JDBCRDD returns incorrect results for filters on CHAR of PostgreSQL. The root cause is that **PostgreSQL returns space padded string** as a result. So, the post processing filter **`Filter (a#0 = A)` is evaluated false**. Spark 2.0.0 removes the post filter because it is already handled inside the database by `PushedFilters: [EqualTo(a,A)]`. This PR backports the relevant commits to fix this problem in Spark 1.6.x.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `HiveExternalCatalog`'s `createTable` issues the exception if `ignoreIfExists` is true and the table exists. However, this is just a partial handling of `ignoreIfExists`. We can cover the other cases too. \r\n\r\nInstead of passing `ignoreIfExists` of CREATE TABLE to Hive metastore, we can handle it in `HiveExternalCatalog`'s `createTable`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCovered by the existing test case.","created_at":"2016-11-27T00:05:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T04:24:11Z","closed_at":"2017-03-30T04:24:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c84d9f68d547087240fb4e66b4f0b7e5db00fb25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e0af91f8ae45a07f13dbe7af1873d5c8228ee72d","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:improveCreateTable","ref":"improveCreateTable","sha":"e0af91f8ae45a07f13dbe7af1873d5c8228ee72d","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

first code block in vignettes is `library(SparkR)` without lib path\r\n2. `R CMD build` will build vignettes (this process runs Spark/SparkR code and captures outputs into pdf documentation)\r\n3. `R CMD check` on the source package will install package and build vignettes again (this time from source packaged) - this is a key step required to release R package on CRAN\r\n (will skip tests here but tests will need to pass for CRAN release process to success - ideally, during release signoff we should install from the R source package and run tests)\r\n4. `R CMD Install` on the source package (this is the only way to generate doc/vignettes rds files correctly, not in step # 1)\r\n (the output of this step is what we package into Spark dist and sparkr.zip)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, \r\n   R CMD build should already be installing the package in a temp directory though it might just be finding this location and set it to lib.loc parameter; another approach is perhaps we could try calling `R CMD INSTALL --build pkg` instead.\r\n But in any case, despite installing the package multiple times this is relatively fast. \r\nBuilding vignettes takes a while though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually, CI.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-25T23:10:03Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T23:16:27Z","closed_at":"2016-12-08T19:31:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6180742aa736caa2adf5cb341bd4a80f99012ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ef26fe3134880924fad03f39b4d6faa84aa05e0","head":{"label":"felixcheung:rdist","ref":"rdist","sha":"6ef26fe3134880924fad03f39b4d6faa84aa05e0","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28383886,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM4Mzg4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"felixcheung/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, correlated subqueries do not allow `OuterReference` columns in projection lists of IN correlated subqueries.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHandleInvalid only happens when ```Bucketizer``` transforming a dataset which contains NaN, however, when the training dataset containing NaN, ```QuantileDiscretizer``` will always ignore them. So we should keep ```handleInvalid``` in ```Bucketizer``` and remove it from ```QuantileDiscretizer```.\r\n\r\nFor example, before this PR, the default behavior of ```QuantileDiscretizer``` to handle invalid value (i.e. NaN) is throwing error. So we expect errors if running against the following code.\r\n```\r\nval data = Array(-0.9, -0.5, -0.3, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9, Double.NaN, Double.NaN, Double.NaN)\r\nval df = data.toSeq.toDF(\"input\")\r\n\r\nval discretizer = new QuantileDiscretizer()\r\n      .setInputCol(\"input\")\r\n      .setOutputCol(\"result\")\r\n      .setNumBuckets(3)\r\n\r\nval model = discretizer.fit(df)\r\nprintln(model.getSplits.mkString(\",\"))\r\n```\r\nHowever, the above code can work well w/o any error thrown. This is because ```QuantileDiscretizer``` which use ```DataFrameStatFunctions.approxQuantile``` will always ignore NaN values when computing quantiles.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-25T08:49:27Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T06:20:40Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T06:20:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e15b5ec0b189228dc7c7b3ff664a755782aa109","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3c3c3b0a3f59bf099df9377dee1e9db49652fe9","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-18587","ref":"spark-18587","sha":"d3c3c3b0a3f59bf099df9377dee1e9db49652fe9","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.1, we did a lot of refactor for `HiveExternalCatalog` and related code path. These refactor may introduce external behavior changes and break backward compatibility. e.g. http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18464\r\n\r\nTo avoid future compatibility problems of `HiveExternalCatalog`, this PR dumps some typical table metadata from tables created by 2.0, and test if they can recognized by current version of Spark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR only tries to fix things that looks pretty straightforward and were fixed in other previous PRs before.\r\n\r\nThis PR roughly fixes several things as below:\r\n\r\n- Fix unrecognisable class and method links in javadoc by changing it from `[[..]]` to `` `...` `` \r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  [error] .../spark/sql/core/target/java/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/DataStreamReader.java:226: error: reference not found\r\n  [error]    * Loads text files and returns a {@link DataFrame} whose schema starts with a string column named\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix an exception annotation and remove code backticks in `@throws` annotation\r\n\r\n  Currently, sbt unidoc with Java 8 complains as below:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  [error] .../java/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/StreamingQuery.java:72: error: unexpected text\r\n  [error]    * @throws StreamingQueryException, if <code>this</code> query has terminated with an exception.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  `@throws` should specify the correct class name from `StreamingQueryException,` to `StreamingQueryException` without backticks. (see [JDK-8007644](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8007644)).\r\n\r\n- Fix `[[http..]]` to `<a href=\"http...\"></a>`.\r\n  \r\n  ```diff\r\n  -   * [[https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/diagnosing_tls_ssl_and_https Oracle\r\n  -   * blog page]].\r\n  +   * <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/diagnosing_tls_ssl_and_https\">\r\n  +   * Oracle blog page</a>.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n   `[[http...]]` link markdown in scaladoc is unrecognisable in javadoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n- It seems class can't have `@return` annotation. So, two cases of this were removed.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  [error] .../java/org/apache/spark/mllib/regression/IsotonicRegression.java:27: error: invalid use of @return\r\n  [error]    * @return New instance of IsotonicRegression.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- ~Fix < to `&lt;` and > to `&gt;` according to HTML rules.~ This should be `@literal{<}` or something like `greater than`.\r\n\r\n- Fix `</p>` complaint\r\n\r\n- Exclude unrecognisable in javadoc, `@constructor`, `@todo` and `@groupname`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by `jekyll build` with Java 7 and 8\r\n\r\n```\r\njava version \"1.7.0_80\"\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_80-b15)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.80-b11, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\njava version

to Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18572)\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark answers the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command by fetching all of the table's partition metadata from the external catalog and constructing partition names therefrom. The Hive client has a `getPartitionNames` method which is many times faster for this purpose, with the performance improvement scaling with the number of partitions in a table.\r\n\r\nTo test the performance impact of this PR, I ran the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command on two Hive tables with large numbers of partitions. One table has ~17,800 partitions, and the other has ~95,000 partitions. For the purposes of this PR, I'll call the former table `table1` and the latter table `table2`. I ran 5 trials for each table with before-and-after versions of this PR. The results are as follows:\r\n\r\nSpark at bdc8153, `SHOW PARTITIONS table1`, times in seconds:\r\n7.901\r\n3.983\r\n4.018\r\n4.331\r\n4.261\r\n\r\nSpark at bdc8153, `SHOW PARTITIONS table2`\r\n(Timed out after 10 minutes with a `SocketTimeoutException`.)\r\n\r\nSpark at this PR, `SHOW PARTITIONS table1`, times in seconds:\r\n3.801\r\n0.449\r\n0.395\r\n0.348\r\n0.336\r\n\r\nSpark at this PR, `SHOW PARTITIONS table2`, times in seconds:\r\n5.184\r\n1.63\r\n1.474\r\n1.519\r\n1.41\r\n\r\nTaking the best times from each trial, we get a 12x performance improvement for a table with ~17,800 partitions and at least a 426x improvement for a table with ~95,000 partitions. More significantly, the latter command doesn't even complete with the current code in master.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a patch we've been using in-house at VideoAmp since Spark 1.1. It's made all the difference in the practical usability of our largest tables. Even with tables with about 1,000 partitions there's a performance improvement of about 2-3x.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a unit test to `VersionsSuite` which tests that the Hive client's `getPartitionNames` method returns the correct number of

And in Spark2.x, framework can choose a appropriate **Serializer** from **JavaSerializer** and **KryoSerializer** base on the type of data. \r\n\r\nAt the **Receiver** side, the type of data is erased to be **Object**, so framework will choose **JavaSerializer**, with following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef canUseKryo(ct: ClassTag[_]): Boolean = {\r\n    primitiveAndPrimitiveArrayClassTags.contains(ct) || ct == stringClassTag\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  def getSerializer(ct: ClassTag[_]): Serializer = {\r\n    if (canUseKryo(ct)) {\r\n      kryoSerializer\r\n    } else {\r\n      defaultSerializer\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt task side, we can get correct data type, and framework will choose **KryoSerializer** if possible, with following supported type:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nprivate[this] val stringClassTag: ClassTag[String] = implicitly[ClassTag[String]]\r\nprivate[this] val primitiveAndPrimitiveArrayClassTags: Set[ClassTag[_]] = {\r\n    val primitiveClassTags = Set[ClassTag[_]](\r\n      ClassTag.Boolean,\r\n      ClassTag.Byte,\r\n      ClassTag.Char,\r\n      ClassTag.Double,\r\n      ClassTag.Float,\r\n      ClassTag.Int,\r\n      ClassTag.Long,\r\n      ClassTag.Null,\r\n      ClassTag.Short\r\n    )\r\n    val arrayClassTags = primitiveClassTags.map(_.wrap)\r\n    primitiveClassTags ++ arrayClassTags\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case, the type of data is Byte Array.\r\n\r\nThis problem stems from [SPARK-13990](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13990), a patch to have Spark automatically pick the \"best\" serializer when caching RDDs.\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `HyperLogLogPlusPlus`, if the relative error is so small that p >= 19, it will cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in `THRESHOLDS(p-4)` . We should check `p` and when p >= 19, regress to the original HLL result and use the small range correction they use.\r\n\r\nThe pr also fixes the upper bound in the log info in `require()`.\r\nThe upper bound is computed by:\r\n```\r\nval relativeSD = 1.106d / Math.pow(Math.E, p * Math.log(2.0d) / 2.0d)\r\n```\r\nwhich is derived from the equation for computing `p`:\r\n```\r\nval p = 2.0d * Math.log(1.106d / relativeSD) / Math.log(2.0d)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd test cases for:\r\n1. checking validity of parameter relatvieSD\r\n2. estimation with smaller

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTaskMemoryManager has a memory leak detector that gets called at task completion callback and checks whether any memory has not been released. If they are not released by the time the callback is invoked, TaskMemoryManager releases them.\r\n\r\nThe current error message says something like the following:\r\n```\r\nWARN  [Executor task launch worker-0]\r\norg.apache.spark.memory.TaskMemoryManager - leak 16.3 MB memory from\r\norg.apache.spark.unsafe.map.BytesToBytesMap@33fb6a15\r\nIn practice, there are multiple reasons why these can be triggered in the normal code path (e.g. limit, or task failures), and the fact that these messages are log means the \"leak\" is fixed by TaskMemoryManager.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo not confuse users, this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a critical resource leak in the TaskScheduler which could cause RDDs and ShuffleDependencies to be kept alive indefinitely if an executor with running tasks is permanently lost and the associated stage fails.\r\n\r\nThis problem was originally identified by analyzing the heap dump of a driver belonging to a cluster that had run out of shuffle space. This dump contained several `ShuffleDependency` instances that were retained by `TaskSetManager`s inside the scheduler but were not otherwise referenced. Each of these `TaskSetManager`s was considered a \"zombie\" but had no running tasks and therefore should have been cleaned up. However, these zombie task sets were still referenced by the `TaskSchedulerImpl.taskIdToTaskSetManager` map.\r\n\r\nEntries are added to the `taskIdToTaskSetManager` map when tasks are launched and are removed inside of `TaskScheduler.statusUpdate()`, which is invoked by the scheduler backend while processing `StatusUpdate` messages from executors. The problem with this design is that a completely dead executor will never send a `StatusUpdate`. There is [some code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L338) in `statusUpdate` which handles tasks that exit with the `TaskState.LOST` state (which is supposed to correspond to a task failure triggered by total executor loss), but this state only seems to be used in Mesos fine-grained mode. There doesn't seem to be any code which performs per-task state cleanup for tasks that were running on an executor that completely disappears without sending any sort of final death message. The `executorLost` and [`removeExecutor`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L527) methods don't appear to perform any cleanup of the `taskId -> *` mappings, causing the leaks observed here.\r\n\r\nThis patch's fix is to maintain a `executorId -> running task id` mapping so that these `taskId -> *` maps can be properly cleaned up following an executor loss.\r\n\r\nThere are some potential corner-case interactions that I'm concerned about here, especially some details in [the comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/072f4c518cdc57d705beec6bcc3113d9a6740819/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSchedulerImpl.scala#L523) in `removeExecutor`, so I'd appreciate a very careful review of these changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR is opened against branch-2.0, where I first observed this problem, but will also need to be fixed in master, branch-2.1, and branch-1.6 (which I'll do in followup PRs after this fix is reviewed and merged).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a new unit test to `TaskSchedulerImplSuite`. You can check out this PR as of 25e455e711b978cd331ee0f484f70fde31307634 to see the failing test.\r\n\r\ncc @kayousterhout, @markhamstra, @rxin for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSometimes a Spark user will only have access to a History Server to interact with their (past) applications. But without access to the server they can only delete applications through use of the FS Cleaner feature, which itself can only clean logs older than a set date. \r\n\r\nI've added functionality to delete individual event logs from the history server, added a request handler to call said function and added a button to the UI to call it. The code is based on the current cleanLogs and kill jobs/stages code. I've also set this functionality to off by default.\r\n\r\nI've left this as WIP because I still need to add tests and documentation for the new code and have design questions that I need input on (commented inline below)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing and dev/run-tests\r\n\r\n![spark18551](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13952758/20547320/0c53fb4a-b0d0-11e6-9af9-3fd8f915557e.png)","created_at":"2016-11-23T01:17:59Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T23:34:50Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T23:34:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"947d9ad01f1337d27c82f3debede0a1b5f55746f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d243293ede2a6c2345daafba5b5cc6259cacd94f","head":{"label":"ajbozarth:deleteApp","ref":"deleteApp","sha":"d243293ede2a6c2345daafba5b5cc6259cacd94f","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41503793,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTUwMzc5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ajbozarth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth/spark","description":"Mirror

problem exists because it's not possible to just concatenate encrypted\r\npartition data from different spill files; currently each partition would\r\nhave its own initial vector to set up encryption, and the final merged file\r\nshould contain a single initial vector for each merged partiton, otherwise\r\niterating over each record becomes really hard.\r\n\r\nTo fix that, UnsafeShuffleWriter now decrypts the partitions when merging,\r\nso that the merged file contains a single initial vector at the start of\r\nthe partition data.\r\n\r\nBecause it's not possible to do that using the fast transferTo path, when\r\nencryption is enabled UnsafeShuffleWriter will revert back to using file\r\nstreams when merging. It may be possible to use a hybrid approach when\r\nusing encryption, using an intermediate direct buffer when reading from\r\nfiles and encrypting the data, but that's better left for a separate patch.\r\n\r\nAs part of the change I made DiskBlockObjectWriter take a SerializerManager\r\ninstead of a \"wrap stream\" closure, since that makes it easier to test the\r\ncode without having to mock SerializerManager functionality.\r\n\r\nTested with newly added unit tests (UnsafeShuffleWriterSuite for the write\r\nside and ExternalAppendOnlyMapSuite for integration), and by running some\r\napps that failed without the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-22T21:28:18Z","updated_at":"2016-11-30T22:54:54Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T22:17:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6cfdeee30a089cd13e59af7972a4c9556018138b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49737d9c574694abb8ea438bd2bb84ca65364259","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-18546","ref":"SPARK-18546","sha":"49737d9c574694abb8ea438bd2bb84ca65364259","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

change modifies the method used to propagate encryption keys used during\r\nshuffle. Instead of relying on YARN's UserGroupInformation credential propagation,\r\nthis change explicitly distributes the key using the messages exchanged between\r\ndriver and executor during registration. When RPC encryption is enabled, this means\r\nkey propagation is also secure.\r\n\r\nThis allows shuffle encryption to work in non-YARN mode, which means that it's\r\neasier to write unit tests for areas of the code that are affected by the feature.\r\n\r\nThe key is stored in the SecurityManager; because there are many instances of\r\nthat class used in the code, the key is only guaranteed to exist in the instance\r\nmanaged by the SparkEnv. This path was chosen to avoid storing the key in the\r\nSparkConf, which would risk having the key being written to disk as part of the\r\nconfiguration (as, for example, is done when starting YARN applications).\r\n\r\nTested by new and existing unit tests (which were moved from the YARN module to\r\ncore), and by running apps with shuffle encryption enabled.","created_at":"2016-11-22T21:24:15Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T17:28:50Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T05:12:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e5deeb196c6b3eef73c3996550d0f88e05fb188","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d97f27b8bf6abc9dbee572cfed7c94af2d6d6170","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-18547","ref":"SPARK-18547","sha":"d97f27b8bf6abc9dbee572cfed7c94af2d6d6170","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor input object of non-flat type, we can't encode it to row if it's null, as Spark SQL doesn't allow the entire row to be null, only its columns can be null. That's the reason we forbid users to use top level null objects in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13469\r\n\r\nHowever, if users wrap non-flat type with `Option`, then we may still encoder top level null object to row, which is not allowed.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this case, and suggests users to wrap their type with `Tuple1` if they do wanna top level null objects.\r\n\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a random OOM issue occurred while running `ObjectHashAggregateSuite`.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be steadily reproduced under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. The aggregation must be evaluated using `ObjectHashAggregateExec`;\r\n2. There must be an input column whose data type involves `ArrayType` (an input column of `MapType` may even cause SIGSEGV);\r\n3. Sort-based aggregation fallback must be triggered during evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that while falling back to sort-based aggregation, we must sort and feed already evaluated partial aggregation buffers living in the hash map to the sort-based aggregator using an external sorter. However, the underlying mutable byte buffer of `UnsafeRow`s produced by the iterator of the external sorter is reused and may get overwritten when the iterator steps forward. After the last entry is consumed, the byte buffer points to a block of uninitialized memory filled by `5a`. Therefore, while reading an `UnsafeArrayData` out of the `UnsafeRow`, `5a5a5a5a` is treated as array size and triggers a memory allocation for a ridiculously large array and immediately blows up the JVM with an OOM.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, we only need to add `.copy()` accordingly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew regression test case added in `ObjectHashAggregateSuite`.","created_at":"2016-11-22T06:40:21Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T19:18:44Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T01:03:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0071b8b9861f47ec64c84bae77b03867cd94716f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6db5af95e456d6529a37c243f41a4632a69f40d0","head":{"label":"liancheng:investigate-oom","ref":"investigate-oom","sha":"6db5af95e456d6529a37c243f41a4632a69f40d0","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following two `DataFrameReader` JDBC APIs ignore the user-specified parameters of parallelism degree.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n  def jdbc(\r\n      url: String,\r\n      table: String,\r\n      columnName: String,\r\n      lowerBound: Long,\r\n      upperBound: Long,\r\n      numPartitions: Int,\r\n      connectionProperties: Properties): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\n  def jdbc(\r\n      url: String,\r\n      table: String,\r\n      predicates: Array[String],\r\n      connectionProperties: Properties): DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the issues. To verify the behavior correctness, we improve the plan output of `EXPLAIN` command by adding `numPartitions` in the `JDBCRelation` node.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Scan JDBCRelation(TEST.PEOPLE) [NAME#1896,THEID#1897] ReadSchema: struct<NAME:string,THEID:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, \r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Scan JDBCRelation(TEST.PEOPLE) [numPartitions=3] [NAME#1896,THEID#1897] ReadSchema: struct<NAME:string,THEID:int>\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the verification logics on all the test cases for JDBC concurrent fetching.","created_at":"2016-11-22T06:01:58Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T16:16:28Z","closed_at":"2016-12-01T07:44:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b70ade0da46661a364e70376ae7e72d35022fc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/728c103fc10d5118eff4ff5bf9372da8557ecf60","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:jdbc","ref":"jdbc","sha":"728c103fc10d5118eff4ff5bf9372da8557ecf60","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new property called `spark.secret.redactionPattern` that\r\nallows users to specify a scala regex to decide which Spark configuration\r\nproperties and environment variables in driver and executor environments\r\ncontain sensitive information. When this regex matches the property or\r\nenvironment variable name, its value is redacted from the environment UI and\r\nvarious logs like YARN and event logs.\r\n\r\nThis change uses this property to redact information from event logs and YARN\r\nlogs. It also, updates the UI code to adhere to this property instead of\r\nhardcoding the logic to decipher which properties are sensitive.\r\n\r\nHere's an image of the UI post-redaction:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1709451/20506215/4cc30654-b007-11e6-8aee-4cde253fba2f.png)\r\n\r\nHere's the text in the YARN logs, post-redaction:\r\n``HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD -> *********(redacted)``\r\n\r\nHere's the text in the event logs, post-redaction:\r\n``...,\"spark.executorEnv.HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD\":\"*********(redacted)\",\"spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD\":\"*********(redacted)\",...``\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Unit tests are added to ensure that redaction works.\r\n2. A YARN job reading data off of S3 with confidential information\r\n(hadoop credential provider password) being provided in the environment\r\nvariables of driver and executor. And, afterwards, logs were grepped to make\r\nsure that no mention of secret password was present. It was also ensure that\r\nthe job was able to read the data off of S3 correctly, thereby ensuring that\r\nthe sensitive information was being trickled down to the right places to read\r\nthe data.\r\n3. The event logs were checked to make sure no mention of secret password was\r\npresent.\r\n4. UI environment tab was checked to make sure there was no secret information\r\nbeing displayed.","created_at":"2016-11-22T00:28:11Z","updated_at":"2017-02-21T23:42:25Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T17:03:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2a8bb900d81bae6e0440dc6f220bf59e4248f98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15971/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15971/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15971/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49015acaf35a2e6b2491c57cd1c71d12ce5a8a64","head":{"label":"markgrover:master_redaction","ref":"master_redaction","sha":"49015acaf35a2e6b2491c57cd1c71d12ce5a8a64","user":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17418333,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQxODMzMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"markgrover/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markgrover","id":1709451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk0NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover","html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markgrover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/markgrover/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a small POC to see if we can make MapType orderable, and thus usable in aggregates and joins. The key idea in this PR is that there is a difference between an unordered and an ordered map (an ordered map is can be compared), and that `ordered` is a property of `MapType`.\r\n\r\nA map can be converted from an unordered map to an ordered map by injecting a `SortMap` expression. The analyzer will inject `SortMap` expressions whenever we use a map in a binary comparison and when we use it in an aggregate. Note that the `SortMap` expression is far from optimized, it should however perform reasonable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests yet. This will probably fail tests.","created_at":"2016-11-21T23:59:58Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:23Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4286cc28ac2ccf11e89ac00a607b0d3bf303aaef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d847b810a14f7783a42cc501dfb01a57769687f","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:orderable_map","ref":"orderable_map","sha":"7d847b810a14f7783a42cc501dfb01a57769687f","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCostFun used to send a dense vector of zeroes as a closure in a\r\ntreeAggregate call. To avoid that, we replace treeAggregate by\r\nmapPartition + treeReduce, creating a zero vector inside the mapPartition\r\nblock in-place.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test for module mllib run locally for correctness.\r\n\r\nAs for performance we run an heavy optimization on our production data (50 iterations on 128 MB weight vectors) and have seen significant decrease in terms both of runtime and container being killed by lack of off-heap memory.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-21T14:01:07Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T15:44:34Z","closed_at":"2016-11-28T15:44:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"745b3e0f7558ca3bd0e44fa8dfc15d4b251fcf51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/011a8d77cac26f820c3cecda1c28e623a64f803b","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:master","ref":"master","sha":"011a8d77cac26f820c3cecda1c28e623a64f803b","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current implementation of column stats uses the base64 encoding of the internal UnsafeRow format to persist statistics (in table properties in Hive metastore). This is an internal format that is not stable across different versions of Spark and should NOT be used for persistence. In addition, it would be better if statistics stored in the catalog is human readable.\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Created a single ColumnStat class to for all data types. All data types track the same set of statistics.\r\n2. Updated the implementation for stats collection to get rid of the dependency on internal data structures (e.g. InternalRow, or storing DateType as an int32). For example, previously dates were stored as a single integer, but are now stored as java.sql.Date. When we implement the next steps of CBO, we can add code to convert those back into internal types again.\r\n3. Documented clearly what JVM data types are being used to store what data.\r\n4. Defined a simple Map[String, String] interface for serializing and deserializing column stats into/from the catalog.\r\n5. Rearranged the method/function structure so it is more clear what the supported data types are, and also moved how stats are generated into ColumnStat class so they are easy to find.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRemoved most of the original test cases created for column statistics, and added three very simple ones to cover all the cases. The three test cases validate:\r\n1. Roundtrip serialization works.\r\n2. Behavior when analyzing non-existent column or unsupported data type column.\r\n3. Result for stats collection for all valid data types.\r\n\r\nAlso moved parser related tests into a parser test suite and added an explicit serialization test for the Hive external catalog.","created_at":"2016-11-21T07:49:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-23T13:09:30Z","closed_at":"2016-11-23T12:52:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6def254db8d9b7621f25f02b5577088b63d9b44c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b341cc655c415a5af9473fbce4deb925b1f77660","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18522","ref":"SPARK-18522","sha":"b341cc655c415a5af9473fbce4deb925b1f77660","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we haven't implemented `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` in Spark 2.0. This PR is to implement the statement.\r\nGoals:\r\n1. Support `SHOW TABLES EXTENDED LIKE 'identifier_with_wildcards'`;\r\n2. Explicitly output an unsupported error message for `SHOW TABLES [EXTENDED] ... PARTITION` statement;\r\n3. Improve test cases for `SHOW TABLES` statement.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add new test cases in file `show-tables.sql`.\r\n2. Modify tests for `SHOW TABLES` in `DDLSuite`.","created_at":"2016-11-21T07:46:56Z","updated_at":"2016-12-09T10:51:08Z","closed_at":"2016-11-30T12:01:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7b24bfafc075e04514d037a9749751261c5a6a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/958fe8b083feb6a312b02abe8325b973bc91500f","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:show-table-extended","ref":"show-table-extended","sha":"958fe8b083feb6a312b02abe8325b973bc91500f","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` shows warning for non-existing tables. However, it had better be quiet for this case by definition of the command.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS nonexist\")\r\n16/11/20 20:48:26 WARN DropTableCommand: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.NoSuchTableException: Table or view 'nonexist' not found in database 'default';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS nonexist\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual because this is related to the warning messages instead of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### The Issue\r\n\r\nIf I specify my schema when doing\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read\r\n  .schema(someSchemaWherePartitionColumnsAreStrings)\r\n```\r\nbut if the partition inference can infer it as IntegerType or I assume LongType or DoubleType (basically fixed size types), then once UnsafeRows are generated, your data will be corrupted.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe partition handling code path is kind of a mess. In my fix I'm probably adding to the mess, but at least trying to standardize the code path.\r\n\r\nThe real issue is that a user that uses the `spark.read` code path can never clearly specify what the partition columns are. If you try to specify the fields in `schema`, we practically ignore what the user provides, and fall back to our inferred data types. What happens in the end is data corruption.\r\n\r\nMy solution tries to fix this by always trying to infer partition columns the first time you specify the table. Once we find what the partition columns are, we try to find them in the user specified schema and use the dataType provided there, or fall back to the smallest common data type.\r\n\r\nWe will ALWAYS append partition columns to the user's schema, even if they didn't ask for it. We will only use the data type they provided if they specified it. While this is confusing, this has been the behavior since Spark 1.6, and I didn't want to change this behavior in the QA period of Spark 2.1. We may revisit this decision later.\r\n\r\nA side effect of this PR is that we won't need https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15942 if this PR goes in.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor the following workflow:\r\n1. I have a column called time which is at minute level precision in a Streaming DataFrame\r\n2. I want to perform groupBy time, count\r\n3. Then I want my MemorySink to only have the last 30 minutes of counts and I perform this by\r\n.where('time >= current_timestamp().cast(\"long\") - 30 * 60)\r\nwhat happens is that the `filter` gets pushed down before the aggregation, and the filter happens on the source data for the aggregation instead of the result of the aggregation (where I actually want to filter).\r\nI guess the main issue here is that `current_timestamp` is non-deterministic in the streaming context and shouldn't be pushed down the filter.\r\nDoes this require us to store the `current_timestamp` for each trigger of the streaming job, that is something to discuss.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we want to persist current batch timestamp and watermark timestamp to the offset log so that these values are consistent across multiple executions of the same batch.\r\n\r\n@brkyvz @zsxwing @tdas \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test was added to StreamingAggregationSuite ensuring the above use case is handled. The test injects a stream of time values (in seconds) to a query that runs in complete mode and only outputs the (count) aggregation results for the past 10 seconds.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to log source offsets, watermark and other possible states, this patch adds a `StreamExecutionProgress` case class to hold them.\r\n\r\nThis patch records `StreamExecutionProgress`'s json representation into logs and restores the watermark upon recovery.\r\n\r\n`StreamExecutionProgress`'s json representation:\r\n```\r\nv1\r\n{\r\n  \"offsets\" : [ \"1\", \"-\", \"-\", \"2\" ],\r\n  \"watermark\" : 200\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Known issue\r\n\r\nToday for watermark to be collected correctly, a sink should trigger the real execution the dataset it received in every batch.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt turns out we are a bit enthusiastic when providing users partition columns when they read the data even if they didn't specify it in their schema. This causes an assertion error in Streaming jobs, because the `Attribute`s of a given trigger don't match the `Attribute`s returned by the DataSource. The DataSource returns additional partition columns all the time.\r\n\r\nWhile this is weird behavior for batch as well IMHO, because someone asked for a specific schema, but we returned them something else, apparently this behavior existed since Spark 1.6. I didn't try older versions. Anyway, I tried fixing this by not enforcing a strict size check, but by picking out the columns that we want from the batch DataSource.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRegression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes/fixes two things.\r\n\r\n- Remove many errors to generate javadoc with Java8 from unrecognisable tags, `@tparam` and `@group`.\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  [error] .../spark/mllib/target/java/org/apache/spark/ml/classification/Classifier.java:18: error: unknown tag: group\r\n  [error]   /** @group setParam */\r\n  [error]       ^\r\n  [error] .../spark/mllib/target/java/org/apache/spark/ml/classification/Classifier.java:8: error: unknown tag: tparam\r\n  [error]  * @tparam FeaturesType  Type of input features.  E.g., <code>Vector</code>\r\n  [error]    ^\r\n  ...\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  It does not fully resolve the problem but remove many errors. It seems both `@group` and `@tparam` are unrecognisable in javadoc. It seems we can't print them pretty in javadoc in a way of `@example` here because they appear differently (both examples can be found in http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.2/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.ml.classification.Classifier).\r\n\r\n- Print `@example` in javadoc.\r\n  Currently, there are few `@example` tag in several places.\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  ./graphx/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/graphx/Graph.scala:   * @example This operation might be used to evaluate a graph\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA TorrentBroadcast is serialized and compressed first, then splitted as fixed size blocks, if any block is corrupt when fetching from remote, the decompression/deserialization will fail without knowing which block is corrupt. Also, the corrupt block is kept in block manager and reported to driver, so other tasks (in same executor or from different executor) will also fail because of it. \r\n\r\nThis PR add checksum for each block, and check it after fetching a block from remote executor, because it's very likely that the corruption happen in network. When the corruption happen, it will throw the block away and throw an exception to fail the task, which will be retried.\r\n\r\nAdded a config for it: `spark.broadcast.checksum`, which is true by default.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-18T22:37:23Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T08:02:28Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T08:02:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4dd6cefcbe64e9fea5192f5f0ddf89c78ca621e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15935/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15935/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15935/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c56974f3e366688fc4c8fa2909a411788b03a1d","head":{"label":"davies:broadcast_checksum","ref":"broadcast_checksum","sha":"5c56974f3e366688fc4c8fa2909a411788b03a1d","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI'm spending more time at the design & code level for cost-based optimizer now, and have found a number of issues related to maintainability and compatibility that I will like to address.\r\n\r\nThis is a small pull request to clean up AnalyzeColumnCommand:\r\n\r\n1. Removed warning on duplicated columns. Warnings in log messages are useless since most users that run SQL don't see them.\r\n2. Removed the nested updateStats function, by just inlining the function.\r\n3. Renamed a few functions to better reflect what they do.\r\n4. Removed the factory apply method for ColumnStatStruct. It is a bad pattern to use a apply method that returns an instantiation of a class that is not of the same type (ColumnStatStruct.apply used to return CreateNamedStruct).\r\n5. Renamed ColumnStatStruct to just AnalyzeColumnCommand.\r\n6. Added more documentation explaining some of the non-obvious return types and code blocks.\r\n\r\nIn follow-up pull requests, I'd like to address the following:\r\n\r\n1. Get rid of the Map[String, ColumnStat] map, since internally we should be using Attribute to reference columns, rather than strings.\r\n2. Decouple the fields exposed by ColumnStat and internals of Spark SQL's execution path. Currently the two are coupled because ColumnStat takes in an InternalRow.\r\n3. Correctness: Remove code path that stores statistics in the catalog using the base64 encoding of the UnsafeRow format, which is not stable across Spark versions.\r\n4. Clearly document the data representation stored in the catalog for statistics.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAffected test cases have been

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark SQL, some expression may output safe format values, e.g. `CreateArray`, `CreateStruct`, `Cast`, etc. When we compare 2 values, we should be able to compare safe and unsafe formats.\r\n\r\nThe `GreaterThan`, `LessThan`, etc. in Spark SQL already handles it, but the `EqualTo` doesn't.
