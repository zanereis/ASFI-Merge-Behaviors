Description ##\r\nThis PR fix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/15029\r\nThe rootcause of the problem is when NDArray is 1-d and the platform is GNU Linux, the backend implementation uses `__gnu_parallel:random_shuffle()` See: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/random/shuffle_op.cc#L53. This explains why crash did not happen in MacOS.\r\n\r\nThe random_shuffle template defined in gcc (https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/parallel/random_shuffle.h#L384) is passing in `std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()` to the __rng() function to generate random seed. Therefore, in our rng() function (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/random/shuffle_op.cc#L49) we cannot use our self defined data type `index_t` and have to use `uint32_t` to avoid integer overflow.\r\n\r\nWhy this bug was not detected in our unit test?

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first step to establishing a continuous delivery framework to post nightly, major and minor releases.\r\n\r\nTo start with, we add the Jenkins job that orchestrates the releases of the different artifacts (libmxet, PyPI, Docker images, etc.) and their relative order, and a parameterized Jenkins job to execute the particular artifact's pipeline (releasing the artifacts for the different mxnet variants). Additionally, we add the pipeline definition for the statically linked libmxnet library.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n-

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\n@pengzhao-intel @ZhennanQin \r\nWe want to use [inception_inference.cpp](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/example/inference/inception_inference.cpp) to do inference with quantized models. But When I tried to run inference, there always have a type inconsistent error. We found that during loading parameters, new NDArrays will be created with default data type (float32) and copy the original NDArray to this new NDArray by using NDArray.Copy(context). So, the original int8 params will be converted into float32 params and this will raise the type inconsistent issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the broken link for `MXNet tuning guide` on the installation page: https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/install/index.html?platform=Linux&language=Python&processor=CPU\r\n\r\nPreviously we used a relative link address `../../faq/perf.md#intel-cpu` which is compiled to `https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/faq/perf.md#intel-cpu` missing `master` in it.\r\n\r\n ## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-22T07:12:23Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T12:38:15Z","closed_at":"2019-05-22T12:38:15Z","merged_at":"2019-05-22T12:38:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"81b4ce2a5ee65de8dd63d14f5c5122d0d756bf08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/0b3058e590ef469392ea8232d0f20b0d56c6806c","head":{"label":"TaoLv:fix-broken-lin","ref":"fix-broken-lin","sha":"0b3058e590ef469392ea8232d0f20b0d56c6806c","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to support zero-size tensor input for quantization flow. \r\nLet's take RNN related model as an example, the `begin_state` is always initialized into shape `(0, self._num_hidden)`, it worked well in FP32 pass, but failed in INT8 pass due to `unknown dimension` error with latest MXNet code base. \r\nWith this patch, models with such inputs are able to be quantized and run in INT8 mode.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ZhennanQin \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThere was a backward compatibility breaking change (#9730) to pooling where pad is explicitly overwritten causing global pooling to produce different results. This causes issues in any networks trained before this was changed as any layers after a global pooling layer will not get different input and therefore provide incorrect results.\r\nTo be clear, it is mathematically correct to have padding == 0.  The PR will not effect anytime the layer is used without setting pad (the default is zero), it will only effect times when global_pool=True and pad is non-zero. It also adds a warning that adding padding with global_pool=True leads to incorrect results and should not be done.  _This PR is to provide backward compatibility only._\r\n\r\nIssue: #14421\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-14421], where #14421 refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Re-allow padding values to be passed when global_pool=true in pooling layers instead of forcing them to zero.\r\n- [x] Added a warning that this isn't good to do.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis is to allow backward compatibility only.  It should not affect anyone unless they have explicitly set global_pool=True and padding to non-zero.  This is for any networks trained before the change was made to work, and should not adversely affect any users.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-21T21:41:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-27T01:44:33Z","closed_at":"2019-06-27T01:44:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2735799a8b47067d37088199118613894ff5c62f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR extends the BERT sentence pair example in Clojure to include testing of the fine-tuned model on individual sentence pair samples. I discussed this last week with @gigasquid [on Slack](https://the-asf.slack.com/archives/CEE9X9WN7/p1558103162000500).\r\n\r\nAll the important changes are in the rich comment at the bottom of `bert_sentence_classification`, and are intended to be explored with a REPL. I plan to copy the REPL-driven example to the iPython notebook example after I'm sure my approach is correct but before merging.\r\n\r\nI think my approach is correct but would like to double-check the following before merging:\r\n - [x] is there a way to pass the fine-tuned model directly to the `infer` API, rather than creating a factory over a saved checkpoint?\r\n - [x] is my interpretation of results correct? I included some individual samples that surprised me.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- ~~[ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)~~\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n~~- [ ] All changes have test coverage:~~\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new examples,  ~~README.md is~~ *inline comments are* added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n - [x] TODO copy the REPL-driven example to the iPython notebook\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] evaluate Clojure BERT sentence

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR backports PR #15011, which fixes the flaky test_bilinear_resize_op.\r\nThe test has been observed to fail on branch v1.5.x [here](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/mxnet-validation%2Fwindows-gpu/detail/v1.5.x/4/pipeline)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-21T08:09:50Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T02:50:25Z","closed_at":"2019-05-29T02:50:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c49635c7d76c60c5684cc20293b21dc99341e8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

[x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-21T06:22:26Z","updated_at":"2019-05-24T05:37:01Z","closed_at":"2019-05-24T03:20:57Z","merged_at":"2019-05-24T03:20:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"5763ba9706e50f0b74d739bd49d131a4de0f35fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAs title.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] As title\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis test is a bit too long (~317 seconds for 10 trials) so not able to verify 10000 times.

Description ##\r\nThe second PR on linalg enhancement. Three operators regarding matrix determinant is added: det, logdet, slogdet.\r\n\r\nSomething worth mentioning in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Matrix inversion code is refactored a little bit to remove duplicated workspace query in getri, and make it more readable and easy to use in det operators.\r\n2. Log(det(x)) in logdet follows the log operator, the grad is passed backwards even when det(x) < 0.\r\n3. Sign in slogdet follows the sign operator, the grad on it is ignored in backward pass since it's not properly defined.\r\n4. The determinant calculation uses [LU factorization with partial pivoting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#Computing_the_determinant).\r\n5. The grad of determinant is derived from [Jacobi's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi%27s_formula), which has a pretty friendly closed form solution for numerical computing when input matrix A is invertible. The non-invertible case is not easy to implement since it involves adjugate matrix. In tensorflow, this case is ignored; while pytorch uses SVD to compute the grad. In this PR, it's left for future work, and now as a temporary method, no grad is passed backwards when det = 0. My inclination is to re-use LU instead of SVD for non-invertible case since it's already calculated.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nContinue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14699 . Requires https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14935 to be merged.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support safe reduction in LayerNorm.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWhen the data input type is float16, we recommend to turn on the `MXNET_SAFE_ACCUMULATION` flag which not only improves precision but also accelerates the speed of the kernel.","created_at":"2019-05-20T07:26:56Z","updated_at":"2019-05-22T18:56:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-22T18:56:24Z","merged_at":"2019-05-22T18:56:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"b3c91bfbbf20893bd6afe99e7995d53da3a69094","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR reverts the mistaken change on `broadcast_to`'s param shape introduced by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14661. There was no unit test for the param shape with `0` as dimension size so this error was not caught. Such case has been added in unit tests to ensure correctness.\r\n\r\nThank @DickJC123 for reporting this in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14954.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n\r\n- Adds code for sorting sequence of integers using a Bi-LSTM. \r\n- Demonstrates use of newer ndarray and symbol clojure. APIs \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] bi-lstm sort\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-20T02:22:21Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T16:05:35Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70d249f82893d69951dab557d251299f58c45b2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":863183895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjMxODM4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Clojure","name":"Clojure","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nWith reference to #14613,  #10002 , this PR intends to add support for higher order gradient for `log` { and ideally for `log2, log10` } as well.\r\n\r\nTests are based totally on #14613 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the

have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] higher order gradient for a `log`.\r\n- [x] unit test for the same.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-18T13:26:14Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T08:40:09Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T17:42:22Z","merged_at":"2019-05-28T17:42:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a9dd721bb49172b1b4bbe9ef99fc8a094d8724a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThe Large Tensor Size: CPU test step in the NightlyTestsForBinaries is killing the underlying CI node (see #14980).\r\n\r\nThis PR disables that step until a solution can be found.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n\r\nAdd a tool to easily run operator benchmarks. This tool will be useful for MXNet developers, power users who wants to know more about individual operator performance. This tool can be integrated with CI/CD, nightly tests to catch any operator performance regression. Proposal on cwiki - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Operator+Benchmarks\r\n\r\n1. This is the first PR to setup all basic required utilities, overall structure for this operator benchmarking utility, and overall skeleton for the tool.\r\n2. I have added <s> 3 NDArray operator (add, sub, mul) and 1 Gluon (Conv2D) operator benchmark </s> <s> 19 NDArray operator benchmark tests </s> 80 operator benchmark tests - code and results markdown file autogenerated by the tool, to showcase how it can be used. \r\n3. More operators will be covered in following PRs. With this PR, we will be setting up basic structure of other contributors to pitch in.\r\n4. Added README explaining how to use the utility.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test

Description ##\r\nAdded the GPU memory profiler.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] In the backend, added an extra name `tag` to the `Storage::Handle`, `NDArray` and `Resource` classes, and a new profiler `GpuMemoryProfiler` that records GPU memory allocations and store them to file.\r\n- [x] In the Python bindings, added an extra `name` slot to the `NDArrayBase` class<del>, and modified the Gluon symbol names to be more specific</del>.\r\n- [x] Finally, added an example that include instructions on how to use the GPU memory profiler and scripts that help visualization and analyzing.\r\n\r\n![MXNet-GPU_Memory_Profiler-Design](https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/blob/master/mxnet/example/gpu_memory_profiler/MXNet-GPU_Memory_Profiler-Design.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe GPU memory profiler was demoed at the **SysML 2019** ([Demo #24](https://www.sysml.cc/doc/2019/demo_24.pdf)). The demo video (credit to Geoffrey Yu @geoffxy) is attached to this pull request. Please kindly check the video for expected profiling behavior. Also, please note that we have made several changes since the demo so the current version (this pull request) might look slightly different.\r\n\r\n![MXNet-GPU_Memory_Profiler-S](https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/blob/master/mxnet/example/gpu_memory_profiler/MXNet-GPU_Memory_Profiler.gif?raw=true)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-16T11:40:16Z","updated_at":"2020-02-21T20:44:22Z","closed_at":"2020-02-21T20:44:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0f2c6892e863a8e4cb721e56686ceaa4839c251","assignee":{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":850606468,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTA2MDY0Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Profiler","name":"Profiler","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"MXNet

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAs title. Improve usability of those 2 test utilities functions. Previously one has to do something like:\r\n```Python\r\na = rand_ndarray(shape, stype, density).as_in_context(ctx)\r\n```\r\nWith this change one only need to:\r\n```Python\r\na = rand_ndarray(shape, stype, density, ctx)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add ctx argument for `rand_ndarray` and `rand_sparse_ndarray` functions\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nDon't think this needs a dedicated unit test, but still got one small script in place to verify correctness of the change:\r\n```Python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet.test_utils import rand_ndarray\r\n\r\nshape = (1000, 1000)\r\na = rand_ndarray(shape, stype='default')\r\nprint(a.context)\r\nb = rand_ndarray(shape, stype='csr', density=0.01)\r\nprint(b.context)\r\nc = rand_ndarray(shape, stype='row_sparse', density=0.01)\r\nprint(c.context)\r\nctx = mx.gpu(1)\r\na = rand_ndarray(shape, stype='default', ctx=ctx)\r\nprint(a.context)\r\nb = rand_ndarray(shape, stype='csr', density=0.01, ctx=ctx)\r\nprint(b.context)\r\nc = rand_ndarray(shape, stype='row_sparse', density=0.01, ctx=ctx)\r\nprint(c.context)\r\n```\r\nResult of running this

Description ##\r\n\r\nPR #14513 update the CI GPU base images and changed the name of the function for compiling for gpu in ubuntu. The nightly tests Jenkins file is still calling the old function. This fixes that issue.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nTensorRT steps were blocking CI (see #14961). It seems there's been a change in the nvidia apt repository. Then `libnvinfer-dev` seems to have been updated and no longer was getting installed properly. This PR updates the TensorRT environment pinning these dependencies. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial commit, the compilation stage was passing, but the test stage failed. It complained that TensorRT had been compiled with cuDNN 7.5.0 but was linking against 7.5.1 (which comes stock in the nvidia/cuda:10.0-cudnn7-devel image used as the base image). So, in a subsequent commit, I've had to pin the cuDNN version to 7.5.0.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nPins TensorRT dependency versions and cudnn

Description ##\r\nTemporarily disables TensorRT step from CI to unblock PRs (see #14961)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are

machines where nvidia-smi is not installed, better not to use that function.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nThe scikit_learn package no longer supports python2 (see [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)).\r\n\r\nThis PR pins the installation of scikit-learn using python2 to the last supporting version.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nCurrently, the installation script for centos7 cudnn only installs a single version of cudnn independendly of what is set in the CUDNN_VERSION environment variable. This PR aims to fix it by making it more general by constructing the download url for the cudnn package from the CUDA_VERSION and CUDNN_VERSION environment variables.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, by having the CUDNN_VERSION defined at the start of the Dockerfile, the whole docker file will be rebuilt if there's a change. Therefore, moving it next to the call to the install cudnn script.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-09T06:48:15Z","updated_at":"2019-05-12T05:29:19Z","closed_at":"2019-05-12T05:28:58Z","merged_at":"2019-05-12T05:28:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"669ab2c0d02eeec8c8c191e6fc41465ac15a279e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nTakes elements of #14909 to add additional build environments for other CUDA versions for developer convenience and release automation. A follow-up PR should bump CI to CUDA v10 for this branch.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a build environment for compiling the statically linked libmxnet that forms the basis for the pip and maven releases.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-08T18:42:09Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T18:23:36Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T18:23:36Z","merged_at":"2019-05-09T18:23:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"b9ea0fa11a0549b14854d35665f79f77bb55704d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR cached the created sum primitive to reduce the creation overhead, which is helpful to improve the performance of current MKL-DNN sum (elemwise_add) operator.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv

reverts commit 0255dd6d84967ad9c18cdc711ff76f588a62ab7c.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nReverting #14884 as the built artifact does not pass the test pipeline (due to cuDNN 7.5 issues).\r\n@stu1130 please check if it's ok.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-07T18:22:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T06:00:19Z","closed_at":"2019-05-08T05:57:45Z","merged_at":"2019-05-08T05:57:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ddef13bd2fe2a74384186dfdb226f5cd6c16f4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds additional CUDA _build_ environments for use by developers as well as CI and CD job.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAdds CUDA build environments for CUDA versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.2, and 10.0\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\nI've deleted the Dockerfile.build.ubuntu_gpu environment and created a symlink from Dockerfile.build.ubuntu_gpu -> Dockerfile.build.ubuntu_gpu_cu100\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-07T18:02:20Z","updated_at":"2019-05-08T18:13:49Z","closed_at":"2019-05-08T15:20:42Z","merged_at":"2019-05-08T15:20:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e03e9ff07b4c34cd165071aeb785db14b965ade","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nConditional and unconditional one step ahead time series forecasting using Gluon, with application to Lorenz dynamical system synthetically generated data for end to end training, prediction and evaluation. The model can be applied similarly to various time series such as time series of financial returns, demand forecasting etc.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

Description ##\r\nPreviously in-place option was removed when build with MKL-DNN. It makes reshape operator taking much time in mxnet-mkl package. This PR adds the in-pace option back and uses a temporal buffer for reordering when the input is a MKL-DNN layout.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also adds a unit test from https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14766\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-07T06:02:27Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T00:25:33Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T00:25:33Z","merged_at":"2019-05-14T00:25:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"13d6ee6bdadb9d4e96bba62ac721772ae8520922","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdd checks for C++ STL containers in DEBUG builds.\r\n\r\nThis important flag will check for correctness when using STL containers such as range checks and other situations that can cause out of bound errors and undefined behaviour while running in debug mode. It will make our code more resilient and help us catch bugs when running in Debug.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't affect release builds.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-06T19:26:34Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T02:31:37Z","closed_at":"2019-05-21T02:31:37Z","merged_at":"2019-05-21T02:31:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"789a6be4eb992a1e2932348367d51012d92cbbc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAs title. The major changes in implementation:\r\n\r\n1. Use index_t to store max_idx,  avoiding possible value change when casting int to float.\r\n2. Remove assert in code, fix a bug in processing invalid box\r\n3. Store global index of input data blob in max_idx to simplify grad accumulation in backward pass.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarking script ###\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as

Description ##\r\nIntel MKL provides a wide range of the generic vectored mathematic (VML) functions befitting from AVX512 instructions, via the integration of the VML functions, some of the element-wised operation is expected to be speedup.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the generic mathematic computations are implemented by a series of mshadow OPs, which encapsulate the functions provided by standard math library, and the vectorization of the input is implemented by dense/sparse tensor, and computations are paralized by OpenMP. Specially,\r\nElement-wise OP taking one or two inputs, with “write-to”/”write-inplace” types can be supported by MKL VML functions.\r\n\r\n@TaoLv @pengzhao-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\nFix add_n forword bug\r\nDue to \"FInplaceOption\" is active, output memory should not set_zero before actually do \"add_n\" which will make inputs memory set zero too when overlap.\r\nFix issue for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14858\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv
