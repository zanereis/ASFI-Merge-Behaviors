The tests pass for the SDK and direct runner; I've introduced a minor issue to the Flink runner that I will fix tomorrow.\n\nMy thoughts when doing this:\n- I can prep `StateSpec` now so it is ready for incorporation into `DoFn` whenever that work takes off.\n- Since the `StateSpec` carries the disjoint union now, the binder should visit that.\n- `StateTag` = `String id` + `StateSpec`. First step would be to express it that way, second step might be to delete it.\n\nIt actually turned out to be a nice cleanup, but there are wrinkles:\n- Since the `State` has to be able to know where to write (in the general case) it still needs an `id`, so the visitor needs an id. But `StateSpec` doesn't have one so it is just passed along. So the visitor just becomes a curried version of the prior.\n- That's all fine, but then the `StateTable#get` also needs the spec because it lazily inits based on it. This is the only time it is used, since beyond then it is contained in the state cell.\n- And then to hack up the `CopyOnAccessInMemoryStateInternals` I even had to re-build the tag `id`. So eliminating `StateTag` entirely would just mean more parameters in a bunch of places.\n\nSo I have this feeling that actually there may be a simpler visitor pattern, or no visitor pattern, that becomes more natural.\n\nAnyhow, I'm not happy with the change, and certainly haven't polished `StateSpecs` to where it needs to be for user consumption, but I wanted to put this out for early feedback.\n","created_at":"2016-08-05T05:11:33Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T04:20:57Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T04:20:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07ed65218fee8d753f1250484693307c3bd8f278","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b4bde87c511c226496f848e4e023c081482cd22a","head":{"label":"kennknowles:StateSpec","ref":"StateSpec","sha":"b4bde87c511c226496f848e4e023c081482cd22a","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [

[x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nIt seems that PR #756 triggered some very strange serialization issues with regards to lambda (https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_MavenVerify/2610/console). To isolate them, I went through the conflicts and peeled this commit off the top. Description follows:\n\nPreviously, the input `TypeDescriptor` was unknown, so we would fail to infer a coder for things like `MapElements.of(SimpleFunction<T, T>)` even if the input `PCollection` provided a coder for `T`.\n\nNow, the input type is plumbed appropriately and the coder is inferred.\n\nThis required internal changes to explicitly support good display data (tests fail with a naive refactor). While doing this, I just added display data to `SimpleFunction` by analogy with `DoFn`.\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T03:44:43Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T03:10:52Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T17:10:30Z","merged_at":"2016-08-05T17:10:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ac5cafe90a371cf616f97cb202d5016b68616d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4ac5cafe90a371cf616f97cb202d5016b68616d1","head":{"label":"kennknowles:Map-FlatMap-TypeDescriptor","ref":"Map-FlatMap-TypeDescriptor","sha":"4ac5cafe90a371cf616f97cb202d5016b68616d1","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

The first commit replaces `ParDo` with `MapElements` and `FlatMapElements` where it is easy to do so.\n2. While debugging, I noticed that `DoFn` used a less-powerful form of `TypeDescriptor` and switched trivially to the enhanced version.\n3. The root cause of issues with `MapElements` and `FlatMapElements` was a lack of use of the input type descriptor. Making it available involved a moderate refactor. In the process I broke some tests to do with display data and fixed them plus enhancements to display data for `SimpleFunction`.\n\nIf reviewers insist, I can try to alter this commit history.\n\nR:

benefit.\n","created_at":"2016-07-28T20:05:24Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T01:18:10Z","closed_at":"2016-07-29T01:18:09Z","merged_at":"2016-07-29T01:18:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1f1fa06ee8683273182548e7eb2d6612040d2bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a1f1fa06ee8683273182548e7eb2d6612040d2bf","head":{"label":"mdvorsky:fast_gcsio","ref":"fast_gcsio","sha":"a1f1fa06ee8683273182548e7eb2d6612040d2bf","user":{"login":"mdvorsky","id":9254652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTQ2NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9254652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky","html_url":"https://github.com/mdvorsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdvorsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:python-sdk","ref":"python-sdk","sha":"351c3831de1bdcfcb19b2f24f9f0b6a19e77e421","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache

does several things in somewhat isolated steps:\n- Unify the operator wrappers. Before there where 4 different DoFn/Window operator wrappers with code duplication. I unified this to make the implementation of side inputs for both `DoFn` and `CombineFnWithContext` easier.\n- Change `StateInternals` to use a Flink `AbstractStateBackend` internally. This is essentially the Flink version of `StateInternals` and moving on top of this will allow us to benefit from parallelism rescaling in the future. Also, it reduces the amount of code we have in the runner because we did all state serialization basically by hand before.\n- Add a generic `SideInputHandler` that uses `StateInternals` to keep the side input data as well as meta data. This is in the runners-core package and should be reusable for other runner implementations. The implementation is rather simple. The complicated part was all the plumbing and translation around it.\n- Change `ParDoTest.TestDoFnWithContext` to allow `DoFn` reuse. I think this might have been overlooked in the recent change to allow `DoFn` reuse. @tgroh ?\n- Change `PAssert` checker `DoFns` to not suppress exceptions in streaming mode. Otherwise the tests will not fail for the Flink runner when expected. Not sure if this is possible because the Dataflow runner needs it like that.\n\nThe rest of the changes are aimed at making the `RunnableOnService` tests execute without errors on the streaming runner, all of the commits contain a lot of small fixes towards that goal.\n\nThere is still the issue of side-input data not being garbage collected but I think this is a general problem and not specific to the Flink runner.\n\nThere are still two failing tests but I think the problem might actually be with the tests 😉:\n- `CombineTest.testGlobalCombineWithDefaultsAndTriggers` fails with\n\n```\nExpected: a collection containing \"2: true\"\n     but: was \"1: true\"\n```\n\nI think this test works for the `DirectRunner` because the two input elements are all processed in one bundle and the Trigger is only asked after the bundle was processed whether we should fire. This produces the expected result. If you have a runner that asks the trigger after every element whether it should fire this means that the trigger fires after seeing the first element. Afterwards it goes into finished state and the pane is dropped and we never emit a pane at GC time as I would expect with ACCUMULATING mode. The relevant code is in `ReduceFnRunner.emitIfAppropriate`. `isFinished` will be true for the count trigger which in turn means `shouldDiscard` will be true.\n- `CombineTest.testHotKeyCombiningWithAccumulationMode` this test fails because it only expects one pane do be emitted while a tuple-at-a-time runner such as the Flink streaming runner will emit a pane for every element. For the `DirectRunner` it again works because all the elements are processed in one bundle and the trigger only fires once.\n\nR: @mxm \nR: @tgroh for the change to the `ParDoTest` test and also overall\nR: @kennknowles For the `SideInputHandler` and also overall, turns out this piece was the easiest to do in all of this ...

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [ ] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nPreviously, the situation was this:\n- All runners inherit a RunnableOnService integration-test\n  execution referencing runnableOnServicePipelineOptions\n  whether or not the variable was set. Basically an unbound\n  variable reference.\n- The Dataflow runner had a profile disabling it if\n  runnableOnServicePipelineOptions was not set.\n- Before they got configured, Flink and Spark had to\n  do extra work to explicitly prevent the invalid\n  configuration from being used.\n\nAfter this change:\n- All runners inherit the same integration-test execution\n  but only if the variable it requires is present.\n- Dataflow doesn't have any special profile.\n- Flink and Spark are unchanged, since they do set\n  up the variable themselves. When they move to running\n  only as postcommit, like Dataflow does, the hardcoding\n  is expected to either move to a profile or move to\n  the Jenkins invocation.\n\nThis addresses the particular aspect of [BEAM-479](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-479) about getting a symmetrical config. The way that the configuration is set up is an annoying barrier to new runners (they have to suppress the thing) and also less readable than a straightforward profile.\n","created_at":"2016-07-22T04:17:14Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T03:01:18Z","closed_at":"2016-07-22T07:40:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f3af8e4162be533238d8df6b29fce82cfd91cf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a34a9a819d12ad4d9c14a7292fc241a89f3f836b","head":{"label":"kennknowles:integration-tests","ref":"integration-tests","sha":"a34a9a819d12ad4d9c14a7292fc241a89f3f836b","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\nquickly and easily:\n- [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\n  `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\n- [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis moves out aggregators from where they are into various places where they belong. Notes:\n- The runner utility for traversing a pipeline and gathering aggregators is moved out\n  to `runners-core`. It could reasonably live in the SDK if it had any other use. It is\n  always easier to re-introduce it that to remove it, so I have removed it for now.\n- The Dataflow runner has a new dependency on `runners-core`.\n  This is a private implementation detail dependency. But it cannot be shaded until\n  we move packages so everything is under `org.apache.beam.runners.core`.\n- The user-facing aggregator stuff is moved out of the `sdk.runners` namespace to\n  live alongside `PipelineResult`, of which is it a sub-part. We might consider all\n  of these living in a namespace having to do with interacting with a \"job\", but that\n  is future work. For now this is internally consistent. We have a thought/goal that\n  the `sdk.runners` namespace can go away.\n","created_at":"2016-07-20T04:33:50Z","updated_at":"2016-11-12T03:01:04Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T18:34:51Z","merged_at":"2016-08-10T18:34:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"adec254d5fdb409e786a1fc2bcee38f8a7a04408","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/adec254d5fdb409e786a1fc2bcee38f8a7a04408","head":{"label":"kennknowles:runners-core-aggregators","ref":"runners-core-aggregators","sha":"adec254d5fdb409e786a1fc2bcee38f8a7a04408","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis PR adds `StateInternalsFactory` which is a map from a key to `StateInternals`. Since `GroupAlsoByWindow` is now truly an implementation detail of `GroupByKey`(`ViaGroupByKeyOnly`), we can just provide it the state access that it needs.\n\nThis is a step both in the progress of moving runner implementation details out of the SDK and also in providing a better user-facing state
