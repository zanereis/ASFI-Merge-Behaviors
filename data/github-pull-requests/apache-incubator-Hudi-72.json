What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis is a PR for the changes that were done in #2475, with following fixes:\r\n1. The actual logic is fixed to ensure it works\r\n2. Code re-structure / cleanup and decouple the logic to detect full table reads from the current logic\r\n3. Added new tests, and ensure tests actually verify the outputs\r\n\r\nOriginal PR description: To read the hudi table, you need to specify the path, but the path is not only the tablePath corresponding to the table, but needs to be determined by the partition directory structure. Different keyGenerators correspond to different partition directory structures. The first-level partition directory uses path=.../table/*/*, the secondary partition directory path=.../table/*/*/*，so it is troublesome to let the user specify the data path, the user only needs to specify the tablePath: .../table\r\n\r\nAt the same time, after reading the hudi table by configuring path=.../table, it is more convenient to use sparksql to query the hudi table. You only need to add tab properties to the hive table metadata: spark.sql.sources.provider= hudi, you can automatically convert the hive table to the hudi table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded logic in `createRelation()` method in `DefaultSource` to detect when a user only specifies the full table path and not a blob when reading the entire table. If detected correctly, the path is rewritten automatically as a blob that will ensure the rest of the logic works as before.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded unit and functional tests to cover all cases: no partition, single partition, date partition, and custom partition/ key generation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T07:52:31Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T03:44:43Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T03:44:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"478df871c449d57ae172f1a96b73e8fce93d1c55","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/540a91e02b5d39bfe2c6c737fa8eefcfa5bf6b7d","head":{"label":"rmahindra123:rm_spark_sql_base_path","ref":"rm_spark_sql_base_path","sha":"540a91e02b5d39bfe2c6c737fa8eefcfa5bf6b7d","user":{"login":"rmahindra123","id":76502047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76502047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378505943,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzg1MDU5NDM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"rmahindra123/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmahindra123","id":76502047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76502047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"http

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe External Disk maps: BitCaskMap and RocksDbMap directly create file(s) within the base path folder provided as input. This may cause interference across different jobs. Also, it will be hard for users to keep track of folders or files created by hudi /deltastreamer. \r\n\r\nThis PR will replace PR 3183. This PR ensures that both BitcaskMap and RocksDbMap create a unique subfolder per instance, and clean up the folder once done. Also, added \"hudi\" prefix and the disk map type prefix to the folder names to ensure easier debuggability.\r\n\r\nWith the PR fix, I have reverted the default config for FileSystemViewStorageConfig.java back to /tmp. The reason is that we need to provide a base path (currently existing folder) to the External Spillable Map, that will internally create sub-folders and clean them up after use. This avoid the situation mentioned in HUDI-2090, where different access control across users may cause some users jobs to fail.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changed BitCaskMap and RocksDbDiskMap to ensure it creates a subfolder within the base path, and add prefixes. Also ensured the subfolder is deleted on close.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added test to ensure the folder is cleaned up.","created_at":"2021-07-23T00:50:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T00:51:25Z","closed_at":"2021-08-04T00:51:25Z","merged_at":"2021-08-04T00:51:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4c14eaa29ed4f3b0f8f44dbfdd75ee68702645b","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/f877900b3c7969ef412f1e3d54bcae4621b84f56","head":{"label":"rmahindra123:rm_spillable_dir_issue","ref":"rm_spillable_dir_issue","sha":"f877900b3c7969ef412f1e3d54bcae4621b84f56","user":{"login":"rmahindra123","id":76502047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76502047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378505943,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzg1MDU5NDM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"rmahindra123/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmahindra123","id":76502047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NTAyMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76502047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123","html_url":"https://github.com/rmahindra123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmahindra123/repos","events_url":"https://api.g

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n - Adding virtual keys support to MOR table\r\n      - Compaction\r\n      - Realtime read\r\n      - Clustering\r\n\r\nConstraints:\r\nOnly SimpleKeyGen is supported because during real time read (snapshot read), we can't afford to generated keys using complex key gens. Query times will shoot up and is unusable from a user standpoint. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added virutal keys support to MOR table for compaction, clustering and realtime read. \r\n- Metadata table is ensured to work w/ virtual keyed MOR table. \r\n- This patch also serialized record key property, partition path and key gen prop to table properties for all tables. If meta fields are disabled, only SimpleKeyGenerators are supported. For record key prop and partition path property, we use the same thats being used by spark sql dml operations. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Fixed TestHoodieMergeOnReadTable and TestHoodieBackedMetadata for virtual keys with MOR table.\r\n- Tested w/ spark sql locally\r\n- Tested w/ hive queries using docker especially for snapshot query.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Adding virtual keys support to COW table for all table operations (insert, upsert, delete, etc)\r\n- Fixed clustering \r\n- Ensured metadata table supports virtual keys\r\n\r\nChanges not covered in this PR:\r\n- Flink and java in not in the scope of this PR. \r\n- Orc format is not covered. \r\n- cli commands. \r\n\r\nTo discuss:\r\nWith virtual keys, we are imposing a constraint that keyGen for a given table cannot change from the time of its inception. So, given this constraint, should we add some validation in HoodieSparkSqlWriter or WriteClient so that keyGen does not change overtime for a given table? \r\nReason I am asking is, even today we have some loose ends. for eg, if someone switches index type mid way, don't think we validate and throw proper exception that index type can't be changed to incompatible ones. Not meaning to say, we have to follow this. But just a reminder. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Made changes to all write handles to leverage keyGenerator instead of meta fields to compute record keys and partition path. \r\n- Added support to SimpleIndex to leverage keyGen instead of meta fields to fetch record key and partition path. \r\n- Moved BaseKeyGenerator and other supported interfaces (KeyGenerator, KeyGeneratorInterface) to hudi-common as to use it across all modules and classes. \r\n- Fixed most tests in TestHoodieClientCopyOnWriteStorage and TestHoodieBackedMetadata\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Fixed TestHoodieClientCopyOnWriteStorage and TestHoodieBackedMetadata to test tables w/ virtual keys enabled\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nNow that we have `HoodieConfig` and `ConfigProperty`, we want to write a small script that can build a certain branch or git-sha, use reflection to load up all the HoodieConfig classes, and generate a .md file automatically for each ConfigProperty defined.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a java class within the asf-site branch, that automatically reads all the Config files that extend `HoodieConfig` and include config params implemented as `ConfigProperty`.  \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new java maven project `hudi-utils`\r\n- Implemented a java class `HoodieConfigDocGenerator` that automatically reads all config files and generates a md file that can be used to generate the config webpage in hudi.apache.org\r\n- Spark and Flink configs are implemented as special case for now as the former does not extend `HoodieConfig` and the latter does not use `ConfigProperty`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nTested with the current hudi master and used the local docker setup to test that the md is properly rendered by the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nNow that we have `HoodieConfig` and `ConfigProperty`, we want write a small script that can build a certain branch or git-sha, use reflection to load up all the HoodieConfig classes and generate a .md file automatically for each ConfigProperty defined.\r\n\r\nThe script will be in the asf-site branch, but this PR adds annotations to make it easy for developers to add names and descriptions for existing and new config classes as they are created.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new interface/ annotation `ConfigClassProperty` that allows developers to provide attributes for Config classes that extend `HoodieConfig`\r\n- Added `ConfigGroups` that allows developers to maintain groups of configs (for instance, spark config, write configs etc.) \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nAs we known, SparkRecentDaysClusteringPlanStrategy is the default clustering strategy to create ClusteringPlan. And it is useful when Hudi table is partitioned by time.\r\n \r\nFor now, users can set `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.daybased.lookback.partitions` to  control the number of partitions to list from the latest partition to create ClusteringPlan.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have 6 partitions based on date, and users set `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.daybased.lookback.partitions` 2\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/126144048-d1b3c468-235b-4d65-baf5-9c5e6d15db22.png)\r\n\r\nHudi will do cluster with partition 20210722 and partition 20210723\r\n\r\nSometimes users also what to skip N partitions from latest when make clustering plan because latest partitions contains lots of update data or some reasons else.\r\n \r\nThis patch will add a new config named `\r\nhoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.daybased.skipfromlatest.partitions\r\n` to control the \r\nnumber of partitions to skip from latest when choosing partitions to create ClusteringPlan\r\n \r\nFor example users set `hoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.daybased.lookback.partitions` 2 and \r\n`\r\nhoodie.clustering.plan.strategy.daybased.skipfromlatest.partitions\r\n` 2\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69956021/126144273-d8648ea7-98e3-43c5-9f70-be367025db4f.png)\r\n\r\nHudi will do cluster with partition 20210720 and partition 20210721 which skipped 2 latest partitions.\r\n\r\nAlso the default value is 0 which means skip nothing.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Adding virtual keys support to COW table\r\n- All table operations (insert, upsert, delete are supported)\r\n- Fixed clustering \r\n- Fixed metadatatable to support such table where virtual keys are enabled.\r\n\r\nChanges not covered in this PR:\r\n- Flink and java in not in the scope of this PR. \r\n- Orc base file is not covered. \r\n- cli commands. \r\n\r\nTo discuss:\r\nWith virtual keys, we are imposing a constraint that keyGen for a given table cannot change from the time of its inception. So, given this constraint, should we add some validation in HoodieSparkSqlWriter or WriteClient so that keyGen does not change overtime for a given table? \r\n\r\nThis PR is a stacked patch from https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3247. So, check out only the [latest](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3282/commits/8acd683bbecb40adfe388157f670e7df8203d88c) commit in this PR. Others are from original PR. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Fixed TestHoodieClientCopyOnWriteStorage and TestHoodieBackedMetadata to test tables w/ virtual keys enabled\r\n  \r\n## Committer

Since the ORC support is under development, the default base file format is still Parquet.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSet the base file format (Parquet or ORC) according to the config when the user create a new table.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nTested it locally using Spark SQL.\r\nI am now able to create the Hudi table with Parquet and ORC format. \r\nAnd I can run queries to read the data from tables of both formats.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n
