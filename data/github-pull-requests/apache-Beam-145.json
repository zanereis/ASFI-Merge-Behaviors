@amaliujia\r\n\r\nModified the original implementation of BitAnd class by adding a boolean value \"isEmpty\" to indicate if inputs don't contain any valid numerical values. Also added some tests to test NULL values. The current situation is:\r\n\r\n1. When table is empty, the result is empty, correct.\r\n\r\n2. When table contains only null values, the result is null, correct.\r\n\r\n3. When table contains only valid numerical values, the result is as expected, correct.\r\n\r\n4. When table contains both valid numerical values and null values, the result should be null, but it seems all null values have been directly ignored before doing the bit_and operation. Only numerical values are taken into operation, so the result is incorrect.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

idea for the optimization is that if we don't observe the window then we don't need to process each element in each individual window.\r\n\r\nWe could make this better by making it dynamically figured out instead of statically during initialization but this change brings us up to what is implemented in the non-portable Java runner libraries.\r\n\r\nThis covers all but the splittable DoFn

PR adds DSL definition of a job that could be used to manually clean /tmp directory on Jenkins nodes. Committers will be able to manually trigger the build and clean the /tmp.\r\n\r\nCleaning is not just simple deleting everything. It deletes only the files which were not accessed during the last 10 hours. That period of time is also configurable. The reason behind that is to make the other executing jobs on the same machine safe.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to run that job periodically as another, similar mechanism will be introduced as a crontab task on each machine.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Go SDK `bigqueryio`package is stuck in LegacySQL mode. This limits the type of queries developers can write the and types of tables they can query.  To allow developers to switch to Standard SQL mode, we introduce a `QueryOptions` struct which can be passed. Future work could reuse this struct to also control validation and flattening, mirroring the Python and Java Bigquery IO packages.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

and Proposed Solution: Current production usage of Beam doesn't have any recommendation for launching production pipelines. This leads to inconsistent and non repeatable pipeline launch. Therefore, we wanted to write a Jenkins plugin to build any Apache Beam pipeline (using Python, Gradle, or Maven) and launch the pipeline on the Dataflow runner.\r\n\r\nCurrently working:\r\n- get configurations from user: Java or Python, Gradle (show added build task) or Maven\r\n- run pipeline on Dataflow using Maven or Gradle\r\n- run pipeline on Dataflow using Python\r\n\r\nRun tests: mvn test \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang

run some internal tests against the output of `publishMavenJavaPublicationTotestPublicationLocalRepository`. These tests do not require the javadoc jar, but it takes about 20% of the build time. We can skip building them with `-x javadocJar` but then publish fails. This change adds a flag so publish does not fail. I don't like adding flags like this (feels like mvn all over again!) so I would love better ideas.\r\n\r\nI want someone who does not work for Google to evaluate how much they dislike this flag.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

execution branch in `UnboundedSourceWrapper` had its own watermark timer\r\nregistration code. This caused the `UnboundedSourceWrapperTest` to be flaky on\r\nJenkins because there would be a race condition between the initial registration\r\nof the watermark emission timer and the processing time advancement in the test\r\nwhich ensures that the timer is triggered. Moving the timer registration code\r\nbefore the reader initialization code removes the race condition.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
