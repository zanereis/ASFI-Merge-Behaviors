Task State Management:\r\n   - Switched to using `TaskState` for explicit state tracking\r\n   - Simplified error handling by properly propagating task status\r\n   - Improved readability by separating state management from query execution\r\n\r\n2. Test Structure:\r\n   - Mock responses now simulate realistic task state transitions\r\n   - Maintained existing test scenarios while adapting to new API\r\n   - Added proper verification of task state changes\r\n\r\n3. Error Handling:\r\n   - Improved error propagation through `SqlTaskStatus`\r\n   - Added explicit handling of failed tasks\r\n   - Enhanced logging for better

Description\r\n\r\nWe plan to deprecate Java 8 as part of #17466. We ran into some issues with `intellij-inspections` check while doing that.\r\n\r\nOn further discussion, we decided that we should remove intellij-inspections check for the following reasons:\r\n1. `intellij-inspections` is coming from https://github.com/ccaominh/intellij-inspect, which is tied down to `openjdk8` image.\r\n2. The image for `intellij-inspect` is published at https://hub.docker.com/r/ccaominh/intellij-inspect, which is outside of Apache infra.\r\n3. The above project isn't being actively maintained.\r\n4. We also have other checks (like `maven-checkstyle-plugin` and `spotbugs`) integrated in our CI pipeline which makes the `intellij-inspections` check redundant for the most part.\r\n\r\nOn further looking into point (4), the `intellij-inspections` check does seem to provide some useful checks which aren't being covered in other static checks we have at the moment.\r\n\r\nSo the plan is:\r\n1. Remove `intellij-inspections` check.\r\n2. Remove Java 8 support.\r\n3. Explore other options like [Qodana](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/) and integrate them in the repo as a replacement for `intellij-inspections` check.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nTo reproduce the problem, first build the module `materialized-view-selection`:\r\n\r\n> mvn install -pl extensions-contrib/materialized-view-selection -am -DskipTests\r\n\r\nThen, run the regular test:\r\n\r\nFor testDecorateObjectMapperMaterializedViewQuery\r\n> mvn -pl materialized-view-selection test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.materializedview.MaterializedViewQueryQueryToolChestTest#testDecorateObjectMapperMaterializedViewQuery\r\n\r\nFor testDecorateObjectMapper\r\n> mvn -pl materialized-view-selection test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.materializedview.MaterializedViewQueryQueryToolChestTest#testDecorateObjectMapper\r\n\r\nTo identify the flaky test, execute the following [nondex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) command:\r\n\r\nFor testDecorateObjectMapperMaterializedViewQuery\r\n> mvn -pl materialized-view-selection edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.materializedview.MaterializedViewQueryQueryToolChestTest#testDecorateObjectMapperMaterializedViewQuery\r\n\r\nFor testDecorateObjectMapper\r\n> mvn -pl materialized-view-selection edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.materializedview.MaterializedViewQueryQueryToolChestTest#testDecorateObjectMapper\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe failure in the testDecorateObjectMapperMaterializedViewQuery test within MaterializedViewQueryQueryToolChestTest appears to be due to a mismatch in the JSON structure, specifically the order of fields within the event object. In this test, there is a comparison between an expected JSON structure and an actual result generated during the test. Here’s what’s happening:\r\n\r\n> Expected Output: {\"alias\":\"automotive\",\"rows\":1,\"idx\":135}\r\n> Actual Output: {\"alias\":\"automotive\",\"idx\":135,\"rows\":1}\r\n\r\nThe flaky behavior in the testDecorateObjectMapper test in MaterializedViewQueryQueryToolChestTest also appears to stem from the inconsistency in the ordering of fields within a JSON object. Here’s a closer look at the issue:\r\n\r\n> Expected JSON Structure: {\"rows\":1,\"idx\":118,\"alias\":\"business\"}\r\n> Actual JSON Structure: {\"alias\":\"business\",\"idx\":118,\"rows\":1}\r\n\r\nThe fields in the event object (rows, idx, and alias) are in different orders in the expected vs. actual outputs. As in the previous test, this order discrepancy is likely causing a failure in the direct string comparison of JSON data.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nThe fix involves configuring the object mapper for deterministic output by sorting it.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

fix issue when merging projections from multiple-incremental persists which was hoping that some 'dim conversion' buffers were not closed, but they already were (by the merging iterator). fix involves selectively persisting these conversion buffers to temp files in the segment write out directory and mapping them and tying them to the segment level closer so that they are available after the lifetime of the parent merger\r\n* modify auto column serializers to use segment write out directory for temp files instead of java.io.tmpdir\r\n* fix queryable index projection to not put the time-like column as a dimension, instead only adding it as __time\r\n\r\nAlternative to #17388, this does a nicer thing of persisting temporary files containing the id mapping buffers of parent mergers to re-use when merging projections, similar to what auto columns were doing with their dictionary.\r\n\r\nI made a conservative but kind of odd change to `DimensionHandler` interface involving a default implementation of `makeMerger` that calls a now deprecated existing version of `makeMerger` to do a signature change to make this PR a bit less disruptive in the event we want to do a 31.1 patch release (i would like to do this to fix another issue with the 31 release, I will start a thread soonly). `DimensionHandler` is not officially an extension point, but is the mechanism which custom dimensions can be defined, so I wanted to be chill about this change. After this PR I will open another one to delete the deprecated thing and remove the default implementation. The interface was changed to add a parameter for the path to where we are writing out the segment in case a merger or serializer needs to create any temporary files, since prior to this the task define storage location was not directly available to the mergers, so this lets things write stuff to a more correct place.\r\n\r\nWhile I was here I modified the 'auto' column merger to use this new segment write out path argument for its temp files instead of `java.io.tmpDir`.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes an issue with projections on a `QueryableIndex` to make them not put the time-like column as a dimension, instead only adding it as `__time` to ensure it doesn't get handled incorrectly.","created_at":"2024-11-07T20:55:25Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T03:00:21Z","closed_at":"2024-11-16T00:46:05Z","merged_at":"2024-11-16T00:46:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"24a1fafaa745fb93bf1522490c095cd689fd9996","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

This regression seems to have originated from [this](https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/cfd07a95b7d592a333ca51597e9bbdd68e18a88a) commit. Prior to this, an early return was preventing this case – seen [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/0efd0879a83191ac550cded6122451ba4bf91194/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/QueryResultPusher.java#L179). \r\n\r\nThis refactors the errorsome query metric recording flow to single function called in the beginning of the handleDruidException() method.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug where failed queries with non-null response writers were emitting double-counted `query/failed/count` metrics.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/QueryResultPusher.java`\r\n* `server/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/server/QueryResourceTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis pulls out the query count metrics logic from `QueryResource` and places it into `BaseQueryCounterResource`, which allows for `SqlResource` to share this codepath. An alternative approach is [here](https://github.com/jtuglu-netflix/druid/tree/add-query-metrics-for-sql), which avoids shared logic between the two resources. As stated in the issue, the ideal change would be to have `SqlResource` inherit, or simply pass on, all query handling to `QueryResource`, but that seemed a bit out of scope for this PR (but I can do this).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I removed the get/increment handles from both `QueryResource` and `SqlResource` for simplicity, and simply made the counter package-private for accessing in tests. I can add the `get()` accessors back if necessary.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

annotation, an instance of the emitter will be instantiated without proper initialization. Having the dropwizard emitter on the `ManageLifecycle` ensures that an instance of the emitter gets registered with the lifecycle such that it starts doing things based on `start()` & `stop()` from the lifecycle. The alternative would be to use the `LazySingleton` scope but `ManageLifecycle` is what [all](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/kafka-emitter/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/emitter/kafka/KafkaEmitterModule.java#L52) the [other](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/prometheus-emitter/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/emitter/prometheus/PrometheusEmitterModule.java#L56) emitter implementations do.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nFixes an issue with the dropwizard emitter instantiation, where the emitter starts up without proper initialization thereby bringing down Druid processes.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nIt's possible for the KubenretesTaskRunner.start method to return before the threads in the exec pool running (KubernetesPeonLifecycle.join) have finished gathering information about kubernetes jobs. This can be a problem because other services on the overlord (like supervisors) expect the KubenretesTaskRunner to have information about tasks once it has returned from start (for example each task's location).\r\n\r\nThis diff adds a wait in the start() method that attempts to wait for all the tasks that have been discovered to go into RUNNING state. This state indicates the KubernetesTaskRunner knows all the information that it needs about a task.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nBugfix that helps mitigate unexpected behavior when running k8s based ingestion during overlord restarts.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n * `KubernetesWorkItem`\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17433, we had to move the operator-chain-transformation logic to the MSQ worker layer to ensure backward compatibility. But it wasn't ideal since such logic shouldn't be a responsibility of the worker.\r\n\r\nOn further offline discussion, an alternative was suggested that we can pass a flag from the broker during query execution.\r\n\r\nIf MSQ controller sees the flag, then it does the operator transformation. Otherwise it doesn't do the operator transformation.\r\n\r\nThis relies on the upgrade order of the different services. This allows us to achieve backward compatibility since brokers are upgraded after indexers/middlemanagers, so passing a flag is essentially passing info whether all indexers/middlemanagers have been upgraded or not - hence helps us achieve backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIn cases where `stopTasksCount` is configured which makes streaming tasks run much longer (in some cases) than the configured task duration, early/late rejection periods are not correctly implemented since they are configured during the task startup time in IOConfig. Instead, this PR propagates updates the min/max times once every task duration.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner`\r\n * `SeekableStreamIndexTaskIOConfig`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This is in response to a problem we've seen in queries where a topN query is done with an expensive aggregator on a high-cardinality dimension. I've reproduced this problem locally, and confirmed that this fixes the issue in *most* cases. The other cases are outlined in Drawbacks.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

The byte count is maintained at a segment-level during each query runner's pass through a segment (getting result sequence). I opted for this instead of doing a %-of-heap based approach as in high-traffic scenarios, there could be multiple queries racing to allocate some memory for aggregators, and these could all read say, 5% of total available heap (let's say this is permissible % to allocate). If we're already at 80-90%, this could result poorly. Instead, using a fixed amount is a bit more cumbersome, but at least guarantees a realistic upper-bound on how much memory N concurrent queries could theoretically use. Changing to either approach (or another) is easy enough. I found the latter performed more consistently in local testing with artificially low heap sizes and with parallel queries. Another alternative I was thinking was a shared buffer that queries can \"borrow\" from for doing their queries, where this pool would be shared amongst all running queries. This is a bit like what GroupBy does.\r\n\r\n#### Drawbacks\r\n- No spilling to disk. This will have to come in a separate PR, ideally sharing some of the code in groupby.\r\n- No knowledge of # of parallel queries. GroupBy is cognizant of this with `processing.numMergeBuffers`. I could use this as an \"automated\" way of determining the available buffer size instead of hardcoding a default constant, for example: `some % of maxJVMHeap / # max parallel queries`\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

The ADMIN persona is meant to be \"a persona who is interacting with admin APIs and understands Druid query concepts\". This isn't an admin API, it's a query API. L:ow quality error messages being returned to the correct audience is better than hiding all error messages.\r\n\r\nThe errors that can be returned back can be user solvable, and other times requires a druid expert. But the errors do not leak information that should only be seen by more expert/privileged personas.\r\n\r\nThe original ADMIN persona showed some reticence to tag low-quality error messages with a USER persona. but it really does seem user-directed to me so USER to me would make sense.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\nAs part of the GlueingPartitioningOperator changes in #17038, we removed 2 fields from `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessorFactory`: `maxRowsMaterializedInWindow` and `partitionColumnNames`. This introduces backward incompatibility when the MSQ controller has the Glueing PR changes, but the worker doesn't:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6fbeef-0f64-4ef0-93e9-6115cf3991b4)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds those fields back to ensure backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nEven after adding the 2 fields back, if controller has the Glueing PR changes, but workers don't - then we run into another issue where the controller sends the operatorFactoryList with the new operators, but the workers aren't aware of the new operators (GlueingPartitioningOperator and PartitionSortOperator). This causes the following issue:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.rpc.HttpResponseException: Server error [400 Bad Request]; body: {\"error\":\"Please make sure to load all the necessary extensions and jars with type 'glueingPartition' on 'druid/indexer' service. Could not resolve type id 'glueingPartition' as a subtype of `org.apache.druid.query.operator.OperatorFactory` known type ids = [naivePartition, naiveSort, scan, window] (for POJO property 'operatorList')\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d17846b-ca45-4676-a287-7fd9dd53c750)\r\n\r\nThis PR handles this by moving the operator transformation logic (`NaiveSortOperator -> NaivePartitioningOperator -> WindowOperator` to `GlueingPartitioningOperator -> PartitionSortOperator -> WindowOperator`) from `WindowOperatorQueryKit` layer to the `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor` layer. This would allow the worker to either run the older operator chain (if they are on older version, not having the Glueing PR changes), or run the new operator chain (if they have the Glueing PR changes).\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\nTo test out the compatibility scenarios, I ran 2 indexers on my local setup, and validated queries for following cases:\r\n1. Indexer1 (controller) is on older version, indexer2 (some subset of workers) is on newer version.\r\n2. Indexer1 (controller) is on newer version, indexer2 (some subset of workers) is on older version. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nWe are marking 2 fields deprecated for window query execution for MSQ task engine. These will be removed in future releases of Druid, so the upgrade plan should involve this intermediate upgrade stage with these backward compatibility code changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

for a issue with k8s based ingestion.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIf there is a communication error between the overlord and k8s during the KubernetesPeonLifecycle.join method (for example when a overlord comes up and makes a lot of calls to k8s), the overlord may attempt to create a log watcher for a still running task and stream this watcher to a file. This will infinitely hang as long as the task is running since new logs will constantly be generated.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nIn the above situation (where the overlord can't get the location of a task on startup), the overlord should just kill the task instead of hanging forever. Currently when saving task logs we always try to create a log watcher for the pod and then use this log watcher to load the task logs.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to do in shutdown() before we actually delete the running k8s job because we want to get the logs up until the point the pod is killed (hence the log watcher).\r\n\r\nThis is not actually necessary in join(), since saveLogs is called in join after the task lifecycle has already completed. Instead we should just get a stream to the logs at the time we call saveLogs and upload all the logs at that point.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the bug described above because the overlord will just upload the logs for the pod at the time of the initial communication failure and then mark the task as failed.\r\n\r\nThe other bug here is that we don't actually log the reason for the communication failure between the overlord <-> k8s. I saw this happen in one of my clusters and it just logged a unhelpful (job no found log), so I updated the exception to include info on the actual exception. Because of this issue I am not actually sure if the fabric8 client actually retried requests to kubernetes even though according to the config it should have. I think if we are planning on still aggresively loading task location on overlord startup (as in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17419/files#diff-bb902bcc2fa097a13509038cd5ae6987b355c2bcf50f7a558bf9c1a3f5d521db) it may make sense to add a extra retry block around the getPeonPodWithRetries method that catches the generic fabric8 kubernetes client exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix some bugs with kubernetes tasks\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle`\r\n * `KubernetesPeonClient`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a DataSegmentCopier interface, and corresponding S3DataSegmentCopier implementation. The goal here is to provide an alternative for those wishing to move datasegments around between clusters. These classes are used in a CLI tool for copying datasources between clusters that was similar to the older, now-deprecated migration tool and plan to release that to open-source soon as well.\r\n\r\nThis also adds the ability for these transfer tools to move segments larger than 5GB using an S3 Transfer Manager.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

This adds flexibility to copy instead, while refactoring the code between `S3DataSegmentMover` and `S3DataSegmentCopier` to be shared inside `S3DataSegmentTransferUtility`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Description\r\nLess ambitious fix than #17391, which adds the concept of value byte ordering to `ObjectStrategy`, this PR instead just hard-codes `CompressedComplexColumn` to use big endian value buffers in order to fix an issue related to value endianness with some `ObjectStrategy` implementations when used with the compression added in #16863.\r\n\r\nI would still like to do the changes in the other PR at some point because it is a path to allowing all the stuff in segments to use native endian, but there are a lot of additional changes which need to be done first, such as squaring up the things that use `ByteBufferWriter`/ `ObjectStrategy.fromByteBufferWithSize` to determine if the header (size) int value endian should match the endian of the object strategy or not, and determining a more elegant way to handle this stuff.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixes an issue related to value buffers being ordered with the incorrect endianness which can cause some complex types, such as `approxHistogram` to incorrectly be read, and can lead to out of memory exceptions in some cases.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Problem\r\n\r\nMetadata IO is the main bottleneck for segment allocation times, which can contribute to lag significantly.\r\nCurrently, the metadata call to fetch used segments limits the allocation rate, and contributes to allocation wait time which can grow quite quickly. The sum of allocation times is a direct contributor to lag.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Idea\r\n\r\nSegment allocation with `time chunk locking` requires only the segment ids and the number of core partitions to determine the next id.\r\nWe can issue a much less expensive call to fetch segmentIds instead of segments if the segment payloads are significantly large due to the dimensions and metrics.\r\nThe core partitions do not change for a given (datasource, interval, version) and we can fetch exactly one segment by id for such combinations and reduce the load on the metadata store, and also reduce the time taken to build the DataSegment object on the Overlord.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nAdds a new feature flag\r\n`druid.indexer.tasklock.segmentAllocationReduceMetadataIO` with default value `false`\r\n\r\nSetting this flag to true allows segment allocation to fetch only the required segmentIds and fewer segment payloads from the metadata store.\r\nAt present, this flag is only applicable for TimeChunk locking with batch segment allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This also combines with another bug when saveLogs() is called with a running task that causes the task to get stuck in a pending state.\r\n\r\nI'm planning on fixing the saveLogs bug in a separate PR + address the original issue this commit tried to fix with a different approach, but for now reverting this change because it seems to cause more issues than it solves.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n- fix a bug during overlord restarts introduced by the previous change\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecyle`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nAs of today tthere isn't a way to define high/low priority datasources. There are situations where we want to deprioritize queries based on the already present time based thresholds, but its possible that the druid cluster might host datasources that are higher in priority compared to others. For this reason, I've added another Optional json parameter `exemptDatasources`, which would host those high-priority datasources, which will skip the deprioritization logic entirely if the query being executed hosts any of the exempted datasources.\r\n\r\nUpdated the class ThresholdBasedQueryPrioritizationStrategy.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

But, with the recent versions (tested on version `28.0.1` and up)', Druid automatically detects them as `json` type. The screenshot below shows the columns detected as `json`\r\n* \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7b125f7-c4e5-4d4e-87c3-bfa21c298368)\r\n\r\n* If the user tries to add the columns explicitly as stated in the current documentation, we see the error as shown in the screenshot below\r\n* \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cba1c83-a4c9-49e6-aaaf-9eeccb0f2cb3)\r\n\r\n* To fix this, updated the documentation to remove the details where we ask the user to explicitly add the columns, along with the screenshot that showed explicit JSON columns.\r\n* Screenshot PNG file dimension is retained to be `W: 1250px | H: 640px` as in the other screenshots\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #17407 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

Makes sure both left and right datasources have valid timefilters and traverses nested join data sources recursively to check for valid time filter. We still ignore InlineDataSource if they're part of the JoinDataSource (existing behavior)\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, `WindowOperatorQueryKit` was passing `WindowOperatorQuery` to the frame processor layers. It was suggested in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17158#discussion_r1793049861 that we should pass only the stuff that's needed in the frame processor layer.\r\n\r\nChanging the WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessorFactory's signature is backwards incompatible, so we are avoiding that. But we can make the change for WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor atleast.\r\n\r\nHence, this PR makes the change to pass `QueryContext` instead of `WindowOperatorQuery` to WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#17394, `workerExec` can get deadlocked with itself, because it waits for task futures and is also used as the `connectExec` for the task client. To fix this, we need to never await task futures in the `workerExec`.\r\n\r\nThere are two specific changes: in `verifyAndMergeCheckpoints` and `checkpointTaskGroup`, two `coalesceAndAwait` calls that formerly occurred in `workerExec` are replaced with `Futures.transform` (using a callback in `workerExec` instead).\r\n\r\nBecause this adjustment removes a source of blocking, it may also improve supervisor responsiveness for high task counts.

4.8.6.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved most 'read' only maven injections to read data from maven session instead to overcome many deprecated usage.  This puts it on their api and thus if things are internally deprecated, its then maven's issue rather than this plugin to figure out.</li>\n<li>remove obsolete script source roots as no longer support in maven 4 and technically I've never seen them used.  Please let me know if this negatively affects you as there are other manually coded items like kotlin / groovy that are in the code there so scripts could be manually added back.</li>\n<li>Remove some of the read only attributes for maven injection that were not actually used.</li>\n<li>More def to object type</li>\n<li>Various lib / plugin updates</li>\n<li>Enable partial formatting (mostly removing trailing whitespace)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compatibility remains with 4.8.6 of spotbugs</p>\n<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.8.6.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Groovy set to 4.0.23</li>\n<li>Drop maven site plugin 3.6 and before support.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.8.6.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to disable logs in quite mode (spotbugs.quiet) <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/842\">#842</a></li>\n<li>Fix output directory per <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/807\">#807</a></li>\n<li>Update plugins / dependencies</li>\n<li>Fix tag used to build spotbugs during GHA</li>\n<li>Use inject annotation from jsr330 instead of deprecated component annotation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Build</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove old overrides from pom as addressed</li>\n<li>Cleanup javadocs</li>\n<li>Remove snapshot from javadocs at 2.1 as non existent</li>\n<li>Order attribute order of annotations</li>\n<li>Use log commonly throughout (newer coded used getLog in one place)</li>\n<li>Sort imports</li>\n<li>Add opens for java.lang and java.util for site build as needed on newer jdks</li>\n<li>Correct GHA for site distribution</li>\n<li>Delete duplicate codeql github action</li>\n<li>Speed up github actions</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.8.6.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports spotbugs 4.8.6</li>\n<li>Uses groovy 4.0.22</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.8.6.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports spotbugs 4.8.6</li>\n<li>Restore java 8 support</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.8.6.0</h2>\n<p>Support spotbugs 4.8.6</p>\n<p>WARNING: This version accidentally required java 11.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nWhen druid.sql.planner.requireTimeCondition is set to true the datasource preview fails to load because it makes a query without a time filter.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nAdded requireTimeCondition in PlannerConfig\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

What configuration values are acceptable?

Description\r\n\r\nThe condition based selector that evaluates tasks based on specified criteria failed to handle empty values for task type or datasource. If the condition is empty or null it can be matched to any task, but previous logic checked for task type or task datasource in the empty set resulting in skipping of that selector. Expected behavior is to treat empty sets the same as null.\r\nFixed the evaluate method in Selector to check if the task type or datasource conditions are null or empty instead of just a null check.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixed: You can now pass empty arrays to `type` and `dataSource` keys in selector based pod template selection strategy\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\n\r\nThe condition based selector that evaluates tasks based on specified criteria failed to handle empty values for task type or datasource. If the condition is empty or null it can be matched to any task, but previous logic checked for task type or task datasource in the empty set resulting in skipping of that selector. Expected behavior is to treat empty sets the same as null.\r\nFixed the evaluate method in Selector to check if the task type or datasource conditions are null or empty instead of just a null check.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Behavioral aspects.

PR is a follow-up to #16863 to fix a problem for any complex metrics which do not specify the byte order of the underlying buffer and were counting on the java big endian default (such as `approxHistogram`).\r\n\r\nThe underlying `CompressedBlockReader` already had the ability to specify an order on the buffer for values it reads, but it was just specifying the same order that the compression was using, which is native order by default for performance reasons.\r\n\r\nTo push this into the block reader, I have added `ObjectStrategy.getByteOrder()` with a default implementation returning big endian, though it probably would have been safe to hard-code to use big endian, since the things that need little endian were already explicitly ordering stuff on value read. However, thinking forward it seems like it would be nice to not have to re-order the values again in the object strategy if we can know ahead of time.\r\n\r\nI have added implementations for `ObjectStrategy` which i knew were little endian, even though they are already explicitly ordering values on read due to the behavior of the uncompressed complex columns.","created_at":"2024-10-22T18:09:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-30T20:49:44Z","closed_at":"2024-10-30T20:49:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":533766549,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MzM3NjY1NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/WIP","name":"WIP","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nIn clusters with a large number of datasources, task operations block each other owing to the `giant` lock in the `TaskLockbox`. This can become particularly problematic in cases of streaming ingestion being done into multiple datasources, where segment allocations become very slow since all of them must pass through a single queue.\r\n\r\nNone of the task operations share a critical section across datasources and it should suffice to perform the locking at the datasource level.\r\n\r\nThis patch is an attempt to remediate this problem.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Dedicate `TaskLockbox` to a single datasource. We can rename this to `DataSourceTaskLockbox` or something more appropriate later. For now, the name has been left unchanged to simplify the diff and review process.\r\n- Add a `GlobalTaskLockbox` which delegates to the respective datasource for any operation.\r\n- The `GlobalTaskLockbox.sync()` must still be mutually exclusive from any operation being performed on any of the datasources. This is performed by using a `ReentrantReadWriteLock`.\r\n\r\n### Pending\r\n- Maintain `SegmentAllocationQueue` at datasource level.\r\n- Fix up tests\r\n- Clean up the `TaskLockbox` for a datasource when it is not needed anymore\r\n- Try out changes in a cluster\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* adds `CursorBuildSpec.getPhysicalColumns()` to allow specifying the set of required physical columns from a segment. if null, all columns are assumed to be required (e.g. full scan)\r\n* `IncrementalIndexCursorFactory`/`IncrementalIndexCursorHolder` uses the physical columns from the cursor build spec to know which set of dimensions to 'snapshot' the capabilities for, allowing expression selectors on realtime queries to no longer be required to treat selectors from `StringDimensionIndexer` as multi-valued unless they truly are multi-valued. this fixes several bugs with expressions on realtime queries that change a value from `StringDimensionIndexer` to some type other than string, which would often result in a single element array from the column being handled as multi-valued\r\n* `StringDimensionIndexer.setSparseIndexed()` now adds the default value to the dictionary when set\r\n* `StringDimensionIndexer` column value selectors now always report that they are dictionary encoded, and that name lookup is possible in advance on their selectors (since set sparse adds the null value so the cardinality is correct)\r\n* fixed a mistake that expression selectors for realtime queries with no null values could not use dictionary encoded selectors\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n_todo_\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been

adds `SqlBenchmarkDatasets` which contains commonly used benchmark data generator schemas\r\n* adds `SqlBaseBenchmark` which contains common benchmark segment generation methods for any benchmark using `SqlBenchmarkDatasets`\r\n* adds `SqlBaseQueryBenchmark` and `SqlBasePlanBenchmark` for benchmarks measuring queries and planning respectively\r\n* migrate all existing SQL jmh benchmarks to extend `SqlBaseQueryBenchmark`, quite dramatically reducing the boilerplate needed to create benchmarks, and allowing the use of multiple datasources within a benchmark file\r\n* adjustments to data generator stuff to allow passing in an ObjectMapper so that the same mapper can be used for both benchmark queries and segment generation, avoiding the need to register stuff with both mappers for benchmarks\r\n* adds `SqlProjectionsBenchmark` and `SqlComplexMetricsColumnsBenchmark` for measuring projections and measuring complex metric compression respectively\r\n\r\nCommon options are:\r\n* `schemaType` - \"explicit\" or \"auto\", to test differences between columns created with explicit dimension schemas vs `AutoTypeColumnSchema` that is used by schema discovery (and numbers have indexes and such)\r\n* `storageType` - \"MMAP\", \"INCREMENTAL\", \"FRAME_COLUMNAR\", \"FRAME_ROW\" for testing various backing \"segment\" types\r\n* `stringEncoding` - \"UTF8\", \"FRONT_CODED_DEFAULT_V1\", \"FRONT_CODED_16_V1\", for testing different string encoding strategies (only applies to \"MMAP\" storageType)\r\n* `complexMetricCompression` - \"none\", \"lz4\" for testing different complex metric compression in `IndexSpec` (only applies to \"MMAP\" storageType)\r\n\r\nMost query benchmarks also have a numbered `query` parameter, the exception being `SqlGroupByBenchmark` which instead has a `groupingDimension` parameter.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDRUID_BENCHMARK_CACHE_DIR=./tmp java --add-exports=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED

patch is extracted from [17353](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17353) to make reviewing easier. It includes additional test coverage and javadocs compared to the original patch.\r\n\r\n**Changes**:\r\n\r\n- Added `BrokerClient` and `BrokerClientImpl` to the sql package that leverages the `ServiceClient` functionality; similar to `OverlordClient` and `CoordinatorClient` implementations in the server module.\r\n- For now, only two broker API stubs are added: `submitSqlTask()` and `fetchExplainPlan()`.\r\n- Note that there is already a `org.apache.druid.discovery.BrokerClient` in the server module that's used by MSQE for a specific use case. This client has a weird contract though, and its retry mechanism is not robust. We should plan to remove it in the future, but for now, it has been marked as deprecated in favor of the new `BrokerClient` added in this patch.\r\n- Added a new POJO class `ExplainPlan` that encapsulates explain plan info.\r\n- Clean up `ExplainAttributesTest` a bit and added serde verification.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, the `BrokerClient` and the related `BrokerServiceModule` that injects it is unused. It will be used by the scheduled batch [supervisor](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17353) running on the Overlord to interact with the Broker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nWith the changes made in #17038, we missed a flow where multiple frames could be written to the output channel in a single iteration of

We read the input channel\r\n2. We call `runAllOpsOnBatch()`\r\n3. If after step (1), the input channel was finished, then the operatorChain's receiver's completed() method will get called, which would call `flushAllRowsAndCols()`, hence writing to the output channel.\r\n4. After this, we end up calling `flushAllRowsAndCols()` again, missing the fact that there's a chance that the input channel might have finished. This ends up attempting to write another frame to the output channel, causing the `Channel has no capacity` error.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above problematic flow by checking if the input channel is finished. If it's finished, we re-run `runIncrementally()` instead of step 4.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with the AppendableMemory where it fails the allocation even though there is enough space to complete it. \r\n\r\nThere are 2 components to the allocation - \r\n1. `availableToReserve` which returns the max allocation that can be requested. It returns the max of the available memory in the allocator and the free space in the last allocated block \r\n2. `reserveAdditional` makes the allocation and reserves the data \r\n\r\n(2) fails if the additionally reserved memory can be satisfied with the last allocated block but not by the allocator. Check the added test case for a better description of how this bug can arise. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nUses the latest lint tools & configuration from @awesome-code-style (ESLint 9, Stylelint 16). Also switches to the [new JSX transform](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) that was introduced with React 17.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n\r\n- `import React from 'react'` no longer required due to new transform\r\n- Unnecessary fragments (`<> </>` blocks with one child) are automatically stripped away by ESLint\r\n- JSX conditionals that could theoretically print `0` instead of nothing are converted to boolean expressions\r\n\r\nI tried to follow the principle of \"break the least number of things\" and suppressed lint messages that would have otherwise introduced a logic change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n- Internal dependency updates in the web

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThere are two things that are done after a scaling action is successfully initiated,\r\n- Clear the collected lag metrics until now\r\n- Record the time so that we don't scale for next `minTriggerScaleActionFrequencyMillis`\r\n\r\nCurrently, these two actions are decoupled and there could be cases when supervisor could be publishing or when `minTriggerScaleActionFrequencyMillis` has not yet been elapsed in which case the scaling action could be skipped. While skipping that action, we are clearing the collected lag metrics but not actually updating the task count. So the next decision for scaling would be based on looking at shorter windows than configured which could cause more scaling actions than required.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates to clear the collected lag only when supervisor is truly scaled.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n * `LagBasedAutoScaler`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
