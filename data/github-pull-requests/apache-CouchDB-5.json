observed on at least one busy cluster couch_task_status gen_server would not be able to keep up with task updates and `all` task fetching calls. The singleton gen_server would start to get unbounded message backups, where the only solution was to restart couch application.\r\n\r\nTo help with that there are at least two optimizations we can do:\r\n\r\n 1) Avoiding blocking `couch_task_status` gen_sever when fetching all task\r\nproperties. That operation now happens outside of the gen_server in the `all` function.\r\n\r\n 2) Use a set ets instead of an ordered set ets table. Previously, in CouchDB\r\n1.x, we relied on the ordered ets table to keep a sorted task list, however with clustering in CouchDB 2.x+ we had to call lists:sort/1 on the task result anyway, so there is no reason to waste time maintaining an ordered ets.\r\n\r\nTo fetch the tasks use the newer `erpc` Erlang module. One concern with this change is how `_active_tasks` will act during rolling upgrades. In that case there are two scenarios:\r\n\r\n 1) Old nodes would be calling `gen_server:multi_call/2`. For those nodes we\r\n left the `all` gen_server callback in so they would not fail.\r\n\r\n 2) New nodes calling `erpc:multicall(Nodes, couch_task_status, all, [])` on\r\n old nodes. In that case the old nodes already have the `all/0` function and\r\n will in-turn perform a local `gen_server:call(?MODULE, all)` and return the\r\n results as expected.\r\n\r\nWhile at it, modernize the tests a bit by using the newer `?TDEF_FE` macros and remove optional gen_server callbacks and module

a way to the developers to deploy and launch the Clouseau search module more easily, therefore making it more accessible. This can help with running the Search-based Elixir tests as well as the Mango `text` search tests.  This could allow us to catch more bugs ahead of time and might even inspire more improvements in the area.\r\n\r\nThe extension is designed in a way to make it simple to integrate with the CI — only the Java environment of the proper version needs to be deployed, everything else could be managed from this repository.  Such as bumping the version of Clouseau or fine-tuning the configuration parameters.\r\n\r\nThis is an opt-in feature on two levels.  First, one has to tell `./configure --enable-clouseau` to instantiate Clouseau locally. This will create the `clouseau` sub-directory that holds the contents of the Clouseau distribution of the specified version, which currently defaults to 2.22.0 (the latest).  If an older version is needed, use the `--clouseau-version` flag.\r\n\r\nThen the `mango-test` and `elixir-search` targets will try to use Clouseau automatically just to make it easy to use in the old way. However, the `dev/run` script will not do the same.  It requires the `--with-clouseau` flag to be passed for that.  That is because the developer may not necessarily want to launch Clouseau ad hoc, even if it is available.\r\n\r\nWith this, note that `elixir-search` is added to the `check` target. In lack of a configured Clouseau instance, it will become a no-op and a warning is emitted.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to try this change.  The conventional approach is to have some flavor of JDK 8 installed, via [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) for example, configure CouchDB to deploy Clouseau and run the corresponding test suites.\r\n\r\n```console\r\nasdf plugin add java\r\nasdf install java zulu-8.74.0.17\r\nexport CLOUSEAU_JAVA_HOME=$(asdf where java zulu-8.74.0.17)\r\n./configure --enable-clouseau <other-configure-flag-of-yours>\r\nmake elixir-search\r\nmake mango-test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `elixir-search` target should not emit a warning (but run the tests) and `mango-test` should have only a single skipped test.\r\n\r\nThe `dev/run` script could be run individually where Search could be talked to, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```console\r\ndev/run --with-clouseau -n 1 -a adm:pass\r\ncurl -sS http://127.0.0.1:15984/ | jq -rc '.features'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last command should show something similar to this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n[\"search\",\"access-ready\",\"partitioned\",\"pluggable-storage-engines\",\"reshard\",\"scheduler\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nConversely, if no Clouseau is configured, there shall be no `clouseau` sub-directory, no Elixir Search tests or Mango `text` tests are run (more skipped cases), and no `search` is reported as a feature.  When trying to use `dev/run --with-clouseau` without Clouseau being added, there shall be errors.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- [`apache/couchdb-ci`

Overview\r\nIn the initial implementation of `$beginsWith`, the range calculation for view indexes mistakenly appends an integer with the size of 8 bits which gets maxed out at FF, rather than building a binary with an extra 3 bytes at the end.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `mango_idx_view:range/5` by correctly appending the `U+FFFF` code point to create a utf-8 encoded binary. Additionally, the Erlang `utf8` binary type ensures the result is a valid utf8 string. If `Arg` is not a utf8 binary, this will throw a badarg error.\r\n\r\n`U+FFFF` is used instead of `U+10FFFF` as it's the highest sorting code point according to the collator rules.\r\n\r\nWe expect `Arg` strings to be a valid utf8 but, to be safe, `mango_selector:norm_ops/1` is enhanced to verify that any argument to `$beginsWith` is a utf8 string.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make mango-test`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nInitial implementation: #4810 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by

Overview\r\n\r\nAllow arbitrarily strong on-disk password hashes without impacting database request performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces PBKDF2 with SHA-256 (our existing version only uses SHA-1 which is now deprecated).\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces an in-memory cache of password hashes with a separate, and deliberately low, iteration\r\ncount. The first request for a given user is forced to perform a slow password hash check (as is any attacker that\r\nmight have access to the on-disk password hashes). Subsequent hashes are faster. Entries in the password hash\r\ncache are time-limited, unused entries are automatically deleted, and there is a capacity bound.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\ncovered by automated tests.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nRemove support for delete markers, and improve consistency of config values following deletion.\r\n\r\nCalling the persistent variation of `config:delete(\"section\", \"key\")` writes `key =` to the most significant `.ini` file, internally referred to as a \"delete marker\" which, [according to the docs](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/config/intro.html#setting-parameters-via-the-configuration-file), should cause all previous values of `key` in the `.ini` file chain to be ignored, and sets the value to the atom `undefined`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `config:reload` [ignores delete markers](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4892). Also, since `config:delete` doesn't reload values from `.ini` files at all, using the persistent variation may result in temporarily returning an inconsistent value until the `config` server is restarted.\r\n\r\nThis change removes support for delete markers. A persistent call to `config:delete` no longer writes a delete marker, but instead deletes the entire line. When parsing `.ini` files, any existing  delete markers are ignored.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this change improves consistency after `config:delete` by loading any values from `.ini` files into the `ets` table subsequent to the deletion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR:\r\n- Simplifies logging of sensitive values by introducing the `maybe_conceal/2` function.\r\n- Cleans up the config application:\r\n  - Removes an unused record field, export, include, and some defines.\r\n  - Removes a deletion \"reason\" that was probably a copy/pasta error.\r\n  - Fixes `should_create_non_persistent_option` and `should_create_persistent_option` tests so that they will run.\r\n- Improves test coverage:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n  All 59 tests passed.\r\nCode Coverage:\r\nconfig              :

Couch Stats Resource Tracker Overview\r\n\r\nWe currently lack visibility into the types of operations that are inducing\r\nsystem resource usage in CouchDB. We can see in the IOQ stats the raw\r\nquantities of IO operations being induced, at categories of essentially \"normal\r\ndatabase reads\", \"database writes\", \"view index writes\", \"internal\r\nreplication\", and \"compaction\". The problem is connecting the dots between the\r\ndata in IOQ and the corresponding database operation types inducing the work,\r\nand going a step further, connecting that with individual requests to identify\r\nthe actual operations inducing all of the work.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I believe this is especially pronounced in aggregate\r\ndatabase read operations that perform a fold over the `id_tree` or `seq_tree` of\r\nthe underlying `.couch` file. We do not currently instrument `couch_btree.erl`\r\nwith `couch_stats` to track operations, so we do not have any data to correlate\r\n`couch_btree:fold*` operations with the volume of IOQ traffic flowing through\r\nthe system. A basic first step would be to add counters for the amount of btree\r\nfold reads performed, however, that would still be insufficient as it would not\r\nallow us to distinguish between `_all_docs`, `_view`, `_find`, and `_changes`\r\nunless we track which type of fold operation is being induced.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we should be able to correlate the overall IOQ throughput with the\r\ndifferent types of API operations being induced. Beyond that, it would be\r\nfantastic if we can extend CouchDB's introspection capabilities such that we\r\ncan track the types of operations being performed at the user/db/request level,\r\nallowing users to understand what operations and requests are utilizing system\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThis writeup proposes an approach to alleviate these introspection blindspots by\r\ncollecting additional cluster level metrics at the RPC operation level providing\r\ncontext about the overall volume of requests, the magnitude of data processed,\r\nand the response payload magnitude. By extending the global stats collection\r\nlogic we can allow for process local tracking of stats and build a system for\r\ntracking and exposing that data at the RPC level, the node local level, and at\r\nan HTTP API level. I think it's essential we target cluster level workloads in\r\naddition to request level so we can correlate resource usage with individual\r\nrequests. Given how variable API operations are in CouchDB (eg single doc read\r\nreads one doc from 3 shard replicas, whereas a `_find` query failing to find an\r\nindex will do a full database scan _every time_), I think it's important  to be\r\nable to easily see what types of operations are consuming cluster resources, and\r\nthen readily identify the heavy hitting requests.\r\n\r\nThis data can be tracked in records in ETS tables allowing for realtime\r\nintrospection of active resource consumption across all operations. We can focus\r\non monotonically increasing counters for tracking core operations and avoid an\r\nassortment of complexity from negative values and dealing with histograms. We\r\ncan leave histograms to other stacks by tracking start/etc/stop timestamps. By\r\nonly focusing on monotonically increasing values as a function of resource\r\nconsumption we can take a delta between any two timestamps and get a precise\r\nrate of consumption for this process/coordinator during the given time window.\r\nThis also allows us to iteratively track stats between any start and stop point.\r\nThe simple case is from process start to process finish, but anywhere any\r\nbetween is a valid delta and we can distinguish between live snapshots and final\r\nfull process workload. By having RPC worker processes store data to the node\r\nlocal ETS tables in addition to sending resouce usage deltas in rexi\r\nreplies we can track node local RPC worker resource usage in addition to node\r\nlocal coordinator processes and how much work they've induced across the\r\ncluster. This provides both insight into the active heavy operations in the\r\ncluster but also provides users with easy access to identify heavy hitter\r\nrequests for further optimization.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on only tracking monotonically increasing counters about core\r\nresource usage we can utilize a delta based system allowing for resource\r\ntracking on the desired stat. Essentially this allows us to create\r\n`recon:proc_window` but `couchdb:proc_window` and identify the most active\r\nprocesses by account or docs reads or IOQ calls or rows read or JS filter\r\ninvocations or by data volume or whatever else we choose to track.\r\n\r\nThe delta based approach allows us to decouple from any particular time\r\ninterval based collection approach and instead focus on what provides the most\r\ninsight in any particular context. This allows at the base case to collect\r\nstats time start to time end, but also provides intermediate values at whtaever\r\nintervals/rates we desire. This also allows us to use the same stats collection\r\nlogic for both streaming and non streaming API endpoints as we can handle full\r\ndeltas or partials. It's key we support delta operations as we need to see long\r\nrunning processes live, not when they're completed potentially hours later, so\r\ndelta updates are essential to live tracking on long running operations. (In\r\npractice, long running `_find` query RPC workers can induce work for\r\npotentially hours, so it's inappropriate to wait until the worker completes to\r\nstream the resource usage, as otherwise it'll be hours behind when it actually\r\nhappened).\r\n\r\nWith the idea of using the existing `couch_stats:increment_counter` logic to\r\nhandle resource tracking, we can extend that `increment_counter` logic so that\r\nin addition to the normal global tracking of the desired metric, we also begin\r\ntracking a process local set of statistics allowing us so isolate resources\r\nutilized to individual requests and even rpc workers.\r\n\r\nThis is straightforward to accomplish from within\r\n`couch_stats:increment_counter` as we have the exact stats being recorded but\r\nalso we're still in the process that invoked those stats, so this draft PR also\r\nhas the local process performing operations update an ets table entry for its\r\nown usage levels. This results in all worker processes concurrently updating\r\nETS tables in realtime as a function of resource usage. Unlike our normal stats\r\ncollection where we have many processes writing to a small number of keys\r\ncreating lock contention, for process local stats each process only writes to a\r\nsingular key corresponding to the process ID, so there is no overlapping stats\r\ncollection across keys, allowing us to take full advantage of ETS\r\n`write_concurrency`.\r\n\r\nEach process updates in realtime its process usage stats as the normal\r\n`couch_stats:increment_counter` code paths are exercised. We utilize a\r\ntimestamp based approach to track when each update occurs, and given we're only\r\ninteracting with monotonically increasing counters, we can take the delta\r\nbetween any two time points and that will give us a reasonably accurate rate of\r\nchange. This allows us to create the equivalent of `recon:proc_window` but for\r\n`couch_db:proc_window` to find busiest\r\nprocesses/requests/databases/shards/users/etc.\r\n\r\nThe timestamp delta approach also allows us to send deltas from rpc worker back\r\nto coordinator during the normally desired `rexi:reply` occurances by embedding\r\nthe resource delta into the rexi reply, allowing us to incrementally send back\r\nworker usage stats to be aggregated at the coordinator level so we can find\r\nrunaway processes prior to seeing them in the report logs. This approach also\r\nallows us extend `rexi:ping` with the same logic so we can keep resource usage\r\nstats streaming independently of when rows are streamed back to the coodinator\r\n(a major issue we've encountered with long running bad `_find` queries).\r\n\r\nThis also allows us to create watchdog processes that kill a cluster process\r\nchain in the event it has surpassed certain thresholds. This would be easily\r\nachievable at the node local level or coordinator cluster level. We'll also\r\nlikely want some type of watchdog process to clear our old entries in the ETS\r\ncache. The process being tracked itself shouldn't be accountable for the\r\nlongevity in the stats table, as we want to leave a small buffer of time so we\r\ndon't lose info about the processes the second they exit. This is a common\r\nproblem when using `recon:proc_window` where if you try and `process_info` a\r\nprocess you found with `proc_window` it could be dead by the end of the proc\r\nwindow, losing any potential insights. By having say a 10 second buffer on\r\nletting processes remained completed in the stats table we can see more easily\r\ntrack and interact with live work.\r\n\r\nThis system also allows us to generate a per process report of resources\r\nconsumed both for local processes invoked by way of `fabric_rpc` and also\r\ncluster wide aggregations at the coordinator level allowing for realtime usage\r\nreporting of active requests utilizing the new report engine. For example:\r\n\r\n> [report] 2023-10-06T23:24:35.974642Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.296.0> -------- [csrt-pid-usage-lifetime changes_processed=0 docs_read=0 mfa=\"{fabric_rpc,open_doc,3}\" nonce=\"null\" pid_ref=\"<0.1558.0>#Ref<0.1796228611.1272446977.134363>\" rows_read=0 state=\"{down,noproc}\" updated_at=\"{1696,634675,974598}\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n# Core Tasks\r\n\r\n* extend stats collection into `fabric_rpc` (or `mango_httpd` `dreyfus_rpc`, etc)\r\n  - target core streaming API operations; changes feed as first step\r\n  - each operation should include _at least_ metrics for:\r\n    1) number of rpc invocations\r\n    2) number of documents processed (request magnitude)\r\n    3) number of documents streamed out (response magnitude)\r\n  - for example, changes feed should do:\r\n    1) `couch_stats:increment_counter([fabric_rpc, changes_feed])`\r\n      - on rpc invocation\r\n    2) `couch_stats:increment_counter([fabric_rpc, changes_feed, row_processed])`\r\n      - on rows read; perhaps also for docs read\r\n    3) `couch_stats:increment_counter([fabric_rpc, changes_feed, rows_returned])`\r\n      - when streaming rows back to the client\r\n    4) we should also include JS filter invocations for relevant API operations \r\n  - somewhat awkward with rows vs docs and needing js filters\r\n  - we'll likely need to play around with what all to collect here, but in\r\n    general we need direct visibility into core operations induced and what is\r\n    performing them; Cluster level metrics give us the former, and reports/real\r\n    time reporting gives us the latter\r\n\r\n* Extend `couch_stats` to do local process stat tracking\r\n  - when we do `couch_stats:increment_counter`, do something like\r\n    `maybe_track_local_stat(StatOp)` where we can track local process stats for\r\n    the subset of stats we're interested in having reports and real time stats\r\n    available for\r\n  - this is the key second step from tracking the additional RPC data. Basically\r\n    we start tracking the core data we want so we can use that for cluster\r\n    status introspection and usage levels, then we gather the local stats for\r\n    identifying which requests are heaviest\r\n  - this provides a mechanism to track any additional stats on RPC we want\r\n    without having to immediately introduce new metrics for all RPC operations we\r\n    want, while skipping undesired operations\r\n\r\n* Store local stats into ETS backend\r\n  - several counters backend options available. I believe an ETS table (or\r\n    shared set of ETS tables like we do with `couch_server(N)` and others) that\r\n    utilizies a combination of `read_concurrency`, `write_concurrency`, and\r\n    `distributed_counters` will provide us with a performant system that allows\r\n    for isolated tracking of per process stats in a way that allows for\r\n    concurrent writers with no overlapping writers in addition to read\r\n    concurrency and distributed counters to minimize impact of writing to the\r\n    shared table across processes. Each process will be its only writer,\r\n    minimizing concurrency issues, yet we can still do a more expensive read\r\n    operation over the ETS table(s) to allow for aggregate real time tooling to\r\n    expose at the `remsh` and HTTP API (eg `couch_debug` functions for finding\r\n    heaviest requests or similar exposing of data over http to end up in a\r\n    Fauxton interface providing real time stats\r\n  - key off of `{self(), make_ref()}` to ensure uniqueness in stats table\r\n  - also can store:\r\n    - user\r\n    - db/shard\r\n    - request type\r\n    - coordinator vs rpc vs background task\r\n    - these are specifically for introspection and grouping on with ets queries\r\n  - use records for tracking data\r\n    - this allows for use of atomic `ets:update_counter` operations\r\n    - easily interact with particular fields\r\n    - also allows for `ets:match` and `ets:select` to perform aggregate queries\r\n      about overal system load. I think this is only possible with records in\r\n      ETS, I don't think we could use counters and select with maps?\r\n\r\n* Extend `rexi:{reply,stream,etc}` to send usage deltas\r\n  - we can take the current stats record for the process and delta with that\r\n    since a `T0` stats record and provide a delta. We we make that delta we\r\n    store the stats at the time of the delta `TDelta1`, then afterwards we \r\n    perform our deltas against the last record snapshot and then we can continue\r\n    to send deltas over time and still return a full workload usage if desired.\r\n  - key thing here is we need to stream the stats back, we can't wait until the\r\n    RPC worker is done because sometimes that takes hours. Need to be able to get\r\n    iterative stats so we can find problematic processes live\r\n  - need to address related issue where responses coming in from other shards\r\n    are not accounted for in the usage as those responses are dropped, eg when\r\n    limit is reached in Mango find at the coordinator level before shard level\r\n  - alternative is specifically sending stats lines, but I think we'll be far\r\n    better served by always sending deltas with every rpc line\r\n\r\n* Introduce watchdog process around stats collection\r\n\r\nThis has two core jobs:\r\n\r\n  1) clear out old process stats after desired delay\r\n    - we want to have data about recent processes that just exited to faciliate\r\n      human interaction with busy yet fast lived processes\r\n  2) provide an automated mechanism for killing processes\r\n    - I think this is an important initial feature, at the very least we should\r\n      be able to tell a cluster to kill find requests that are still going after\r\n      an hour, for example.\r\n    - can easily find long running processes or heavy processes using ets:select\r\n    - can also key on user to find most active users\r\n    - I think with a bit of thought and a few configuration options we can make\r\n      this usable for helping out with problematic specific workflows on a per\r\n      user/request basis\r\n    - for example:\r\n      - \"automatically kill all find requests that have processed a million docs\r\n        yet returned none\"\r\n\r\n* Introduce remsh/http level introspection tooling\r\n  - eg make `couchdb:proc_window` and some other tools for filtering and sorting\r\n    the stats collection tables. This tooling should be readily available by way\r\n    of remsh but we should also expose the same introspection APIs over http\r\n    from the get go so that this can be utilized directly by users with curl and\r\n    end up in a nice Fauxton dashboard showing realtime usage levels.\r\n  - this doesn't have to be complicated, but should easily be able to query the\r\n    local rpc node, all cluster rpc nodes, and all cluster coordinators. It\r\n    should be easy to get a cluster level view of overall usage, grouped by the\r\n    desired set of stats.\r\n  - provide tooling to teardown RPC workers and coordinators with full worker\r\n    teardown. Once we make it easy to find the heavy hitters, we need to make it\r\n    easy to take action against them. Obviously being able to kill the processes\r\n    is essential, but I could see providing additional functionality like\r\n    perhaps allowing for lowering the IOQ priority for the given request if it's\r\n    a request that genuinely needs to complete but is impacting the system.\r\n\r\nI've got a hacked together http API to demonstrate being able to query the stats\r\ncollection across the cluster directly over http:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1719\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 3 29 50 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/assets/5326/1aebe0f7-ec8a-4f36-8a0f-f92385d8a96b\">\r\n\r\n\r\n# Overall Approach\r\n\r\nThe key task here is to build out the mechanisms for collecting/tracking stats\r\nlocally, shipping them back over the wire to the coordinator for aggregation,\r\nhandling the deltas, exposing them realtime stats, and then generating reports\r\nwith the data. I believe this to be the core work at hand, where afterwards\r\nextending out the API operations to collect the data is fairly straightforward;\r\nfor instance, once the functionality is in place, adding changes feed reports\r\nis simply adding the new stats to collect to the relevant `fabric_rpc`\r\nfunctions and then ensuring we've flagged those new stats as desired fields to\r\nexpose in our resource usage tracking. We could easily extend compactions or\r\nindexing with similar stats and reporting logic. Once we have a system in place\r\nfor tracking process local metrics, sending and aggregating the deltas, then\r\nexposing the data over querying interfaces, we can easily extend this level of\r\nintrospection to any operations in the system, and in my opinion, we should\r\nextend this coverage to 100% of database operations such that all resource\r\nusage is accounted for and tracked.\r\n\r\nThis is still a bit rough in a few areas, and not everything is fully\r\noperational, but essentially the core framework is operational and demonstrates\r\na working version of what I've detailed out. I believe this to be a viable\r\napproach and that the proof of concept provides a clear path forward on how to\r\ndeliver this.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-17T21:53:31Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T17:50:10Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/03715890285dedbca8c8e4f104a78519af26e603","head":{"label":"apache:couch-stats-resource-tracker","ref":"couch-stats-resource-tracker","sha":"03715890285dedbca8c8e4f104a78519af26e603","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

This was observed in the CI test as described in: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4809\r\n\r\nThe process in more detail was as follows:\r\n\r\n  * When an async opener result is handled in the index server, there is a period of time when the index server is linked to both the index and the opener process.\r\n\r\n  * After we reply early to the waiting clients, a client may do something to cause the indexer to crash, which would crash the opener along with it. That would generate two `{'EXIT', Pid, _}` messages queued in the indexer process' mailbox.\r\n\r\n  * The index gen_server, is still processing the async opener result callback, where it would remove the opener from the `openers` table, then it returns `ok` to the async opener.\r\n\r\n  * Index gen_server continues processing queued `EXIT` messages in `handle_info`:\r\n     - The one for the indexer Pid is handled appropriately\r\n     - The one for the opener leads to an `exit(...)` clause since we ended with an unknown process exiting.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the race condition, and the extra opener `EXIT` message, unlink and reply early to the opener, as soon we linked to the indexer or had received the error. To avoid the small chance of still getting an `EXIT` message from the opener, in case it crashed right before we unlinked, flush any exit messages from it. We do a similar flushing in two other places so create small utility function to avoid duplicating the code too much.\r\n\r\nFix:

This is a compliment / precursor to optimising `$regex` support as proposed in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4776.\r\n\r\nFor `json` indexes, a $beginsWith operator translates into a key range query, as is common practice for _view queries. For example, to find all rows with a key beginning with \"W\", we can use a range `start_key=\"W\", end_key=\"W\\ufff0\"`. Given Mango uses compound keys, this is slightly more complex in practice, but the idea is the same. As with other range operators (`$gt`, `$gte`, etc), `$beginsWith` can be used in combination with equality operators and result sorting but must result in a contiguous key range. That is, a range of `start_key=[10, \"W\"], end_key=[10, \"W\\ufff0\", {}]` would be valid, but `start_key=[\"W\", 10], end_key=[\"W\\ufff0\", 10, {}]` would not, because the second element of the key may result in a non-contiguous range.\r\n\r\nFor text indexes, `$beginsWith` translates to a Lucene query on the specified field of `W*`.\r\n\r\nIf a non-string operand is provided to `$beginsWith`, the request will fail with a 400 / `invalid_operator` error.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI've only tested this with json indexes so far because the dev container doesn't have `text` index support.\r\n\r\nA basic eunit test is added for the new `selector` support. You can run these using `make eunit apps=mango`.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests are added to the Mango test suite, which can be run via `make mango-test`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

MacOS runner this test can be flaky. On slower workers StreamPid would usually be killed by the time we check is_process_alive/1, however on MacOS it has failed at least once with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule 'couch_stream_tests'\r\n  CouchDB stream tests\r\n   couch_stream_tests:124: -should_stop_on_normal_exit_of_stream_opener/1-fun-3-...*failed*\r\n   in function couch_stream_tests:'-should_stop_on_normal_exit_of_stream_opener/1-fun-3-'/1 (test/eunit/couch_stream_tests.erl, line 124)\r\n   in call from eunit_test:run_testfun/1 (eunit_test.erl, line 71)\r\n[...]\r\n   **error:{assert,[{module,couch_stream_tests},\r\n           {line,124},\r\n   {expression,\"not ( is_process_alive ( StreamPid ) )\"},\r\n   {expected,true},\r\n   {value,false}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix it, ensure we wait for the process to die before asserting it's dead. It's a bit redundant to assert it's gone, but we leave that in the test mostly to make it obvious what we're after. If the process refuses to die the test will most likely fail a timeout.\r\n\r\nWhile we're at it, modernize the test suite to use the standard `?TDEF_FE` macros. In some cases we were running the test code in the setup phase instead of the test itself (`_assert...` vs `assert...` calls), so this should fix that as well.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-16T21:52:35Z","updated_at":"2023-10-16T22:35:27Z","closed_at":"2023-10-16T22:35:24Z","merged_at":"2023-10-16T22:35:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c2e50319d8553a6db9f689623ceb0901e9e52dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/dd41bc98d8ef9463d323da456a2b50051c2e25c0","head":{"label":"apache:fix-stream-tests-flaky-failure","ref":"fix-stream-tests-flaky-failure","sha":"dd41bc98d8ef9463d323da456a2b50051c2e25c0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously, Mango tests which only apply to JSON indexes were being skipped if the clouseau (text index) service was enabled for the CouchDB instance being tested against, resulting in tests being skipped in some CI cases.\r\n\r\nThis refactors the tests so that we execute these tests on JSON / all_docs indexes regardless of whether clouseau is present or not.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make mango-test` with / without clouseau enabled.\r\n\r\nNote that `nose2` will report skipped tests in the `Ran N tests` output. With this change, we see the same number of tests executed when `clouseau` is not enabled:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nRan 373 tests in 11.328s\r\n\r\nOK (skipped=146)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nRan 368 tests in 12.104s\r\n\r\nOK (skipped=141)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `clouseau` enabled we see fewer skipped tests after this change (so more overall):\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nRan 373 tests in 37.748s\r\n\r\nOK (skipped=16)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nRan 368 tests in 35.741s\r\n\r\nOK (skipped=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affect multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes

Overview\r\n\r\nTo smooth cluster upgrades, send the original format of AuthSession cookie if MustMatchBasic is false (i.e, when generating a Cookie from a successful cookie_auth_handler call).\r\n\r\nPrior to this (and after 50c69a0c68), during an upgrade, a cookie issued by the basic auth handler from an upgraded node will not be parseable by not-upgraded nodes.\r\n\r\nWith this change a cookie issued by the cookie_auth_handler retains its original format. Only cookies issued by the default_auth_handler will be the new format.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1) Create a mixed state cluster (with a node on code before https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4702 and other nodes with this code or later).\r\n2) acquire a cookie from new node via `/_session`\r\n3) present the cookie  to an old node.\r\n4) cookie should be accepted.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4702\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are

is an alternative to #4710 based on the results of the related discussion.*\r\n\r\nIt is not always beneficial for the performance if the Mango query planner tries to assign an index to the selector.  User-specified indexes may save the day, but since they are only hints for the planner, fallbacks may still happen.\r\n\r\nIntroduce the `allow_fallback` flag which can be used to tell if falling back to other indexes is acceptable when an index is explicitly specified by the user or when only the \"catch-all\" `all_docs` index could be picked.  When set to `false`, give up on planning and return an HTTP 400 response right away.  This way the user has the chance to learn about the requested but missing index, optionally create it and try again.\r\n\r\nBy default, fallbacks are allowed to maintain backwards compatibility.  It is possible to set `allow_fallback` to `true` but currently it coincides with the default behavior hence becomes a no-op in practice.\r\n\r\nFixes #4511\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe changes could be verified by the following commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmake eunit apps=mango\r\nmake mango-test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a non-breaking change, so there should be no observable difference in the behavior for the users.  When `allow_fallback` is set to `false` and `use_index` is set to some index, it may return HTTP 400 depending on the suitability of the given index.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written

evaluating various JS engine versions it's useful to track not just error metrics, but also how fast commands execute. To avoid creating a large number of histograms, and keep the metrics count reasonable, keep track of the total accumulated time spent on  some of the more frequently used commands.\r\n\r\nTo reduce counting json serialization into the JS processing time, move the writejson/2 and writeline/2 logic into the `prompt` callback. The time delta, is then taken after the data is serialized, and after it's deserialized from readjson/1. The reason for the asymmetry is that response data could be streamed back byte-by-byte, so in that case to keep it simpler, opt to record the times after json had already been parsed.\r\n\r\nTake advantage of updating couch_js_module and switch it to use the more common ?TDEF macro. Also, take the opportinity to expand the coverage of the couch_js_module so it also tests reduces, add_lib and some ddoc operations like vdu, filter, and

this one fail multiple times already.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we were counting the exact number of calls each of the mocked functions were called. However, those calls were made from separate processes with non-deterministic number of retries each, so sometimes, there could be 8 calls, 9 or 10. (Confirmed by adding random sleep in `mem3_reshard_index:retry/3` to reproduce it locally).\r\n\r\nWe mainly care that the shard is split, the indices finished building, and that those mocked index functions were called more than 4 times due to retries so let's make the test do that

Overview\r\n\r\nBy default, erlang does not recognise wildcards in Server Name Indication fields (which is bizarre but they seem committed to this error).\r\n\r\nFortunately they also ship a function that does validate them, you just have to hook it up.\r\n\r\nSo here we do that hooking up.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nWe are following the published advice at https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ssl.html#type-customize_hostname_check;\r\n\r\n> Customizes the hostname verification of the peer certificate, as different protocols that use TLS such as HTTP or LDAP may want to do it differently. For example the get standard HTTPS handling provide the already implememnted fun from the public_key application for HTTPS. `{customize_hostname_check, [{match_fun, public_key:pkix_verify_hostname_match_fun(https)}]}`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are

`fields` attribute on `_explain` might have the string value `\"all_fields\"` when the respective query parameter (`fields`) is not set by the user.  This is to express that no projection of fields would happen on the returned documents.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior contradicts with the current contract, because by documentation, `fields` is an array of strings instead to provide information on the projected fields.  The discrepancy here makes it hard to formalize this in OpenAPI which leads to problems in the development of SDKs, among others.\r\n\r\nChange `_explain` to return `[]` for `fields` when it was not set through the query parameters. This is thought to be semantically equivalent to `\"all_fields\"` therefore this would not cause problems while preserving the promised type.\r\n\r\nThanks @ricellis for reporting this problem!\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=mango\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers who based their solution on utilizing the `\"all_fields\"` response explicitly might need to change it to use `[]` instead. Otherwise they will not be affected by the change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Documentation changes were made

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a performance only pull request, but a complicated one.\r\n\r\nI benchmarked nouveau against clouseau for the same database and found it was slower (2-4x slower depending on how large the documents were, the smaller the docs the bigger the difference).\r\n\r\nThis is fundamentally because clouseau's overhead between erlang and the jvm is much lower, as they are exchanging messages over an established, dedicated connection.\r\n\r\nTo improve nouveau performance I have adopted a similar approach, while ensuring index consistency.\r\n\r\n1) nouveau on the jvm side requires each index update request (whether a document update, delete or purge, or a request to advance update_seq or purge_seq independently from an index change) to pass the current update_seq or purge_seq of the index. This is critical in detecting missed updates in the events of failure.\r\n2) nouveau_index_updater spawns its own ibrowse worker (and, thus, its own dedicated http connection) when it starts to update an index. This ensures that all requests issued from the erlang side are received in the same order on the jvm side. Using the ibrowse pool would have allowed for a reordering.\r\n3) finally, the performance improvement itself. nouveau_index_updater sets the `[{stream_to, self()}]` option, so does not wait for the response, successful or otherwise, before making the next one. This is why item 1 is critical. If there is a failure for one update, all subsequent updates will also fail, as the update/purge sequence on the jvm side will not have advanced. At the start of each loop of the callback fun we do a selective receive to collect any and all async responses we might have received. If any are errors, we terminate the update process with that error. We also check after the callback fun is finished but this time we block to receive all the outstanding responses, to ensure the index is in the state we require before issuing the request.\r\n\r\nI've separated out these changes across multiple commits for readability.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\ncovered by the test suite\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n##

when processing long running streaming requests, such as _find with a highly selective selector, when no rows are emitted for a while, the client could disconnect but the request process, and all the associated workers on remote nodes would continue running, consuming server resources.\r\n\r\nWe already handle remote (RPC) process cleanup if the coordinator crashes, we just need a way to kill that coordinator if the connection is closed in the case when no data may be emitted for a long time. This is what the current commit accomplishes.\r\n\r\nIt turns out there is no simple way to detect passive mode socket disconnects in current versions of Erlang/OTP. The socket at the kernel level may be closed (in close_wait state), however `inet:info/1` will continue reporting it as `connected`. The only ways to obtain an accurate connection state is to try to write, read, or query the TCP info state.\r\n\r\nHere we attempt to query the state with tcp_info. Unfortunately, not all versions of supported OTP platforms have this option, so it probably never became an officially supported inet socket option, so we use `raw` socket option for it. However, it turns out most of CouchDB supported platforms do have that option. The only platform this is not working currently is Windows. In that case, or future platform cases we default to the previous behavior, assuming the socket is still open.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-23T20:55:40Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T17:23:19Z","closed_at":"2023-08-25T17:23:17Z","merged_at":"2023-08-25T17:23:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"d5701f437183c3742aab5812e298d5bb80cb0c15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4736/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4736/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4736/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/43d6cafb830f566bcd245ac3939b956091e27694","head":{"label":"apache:monitor-client-socket-for-disconnections","ref":"monitor-client-socket-for-disconnections","sha":"43d6cafb830f566bcd245ac3939b956091e27694","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nIn case of map-reduce views, the arrival of the `complete` message is not guaranteed for the view callback (at the shard) when a `stop` is issued during the aggregation (at the coordinator).  Due to that, internally collected shard-level statistics may not be fed back to the coordinator which can cause data loss hence inaccuracy in the overall execution statistics.\r\n\r\nAddress this issue by switching to a \"rolling\" model where row-level statistics are immediately streamed back to the coordinator.  Support mixed-version cluster upgrades by activating this model only if requested through the map-reduce arguments and the given shard supports that.\r\n\r\nThis is only a proposal, a way explore the approach, comments and feedback are welcome.  Remarks:\r\n- It clearly uses more bandwidth as it will send more `execution_stats` messages.  Is this acceptable?\r\n- It does not require changes in fabric itself, the whole logic is kept on the Mango side and it is compatible with the previous solution.\r\n- Are there other ways to stop the aggregation as soon as the limit is reached?\r\n- Are there other kind of messages coming from the shards that could be reliably used to signal the end of statistics collection (alternatives to capturing `complete`)? \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRunning the respective Mango unit and integration test suites might suffice (which is done by the CI):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmake eunit apps=mango\r\nmake mango-test MANGO_TEST_OPTS=\"15-execution-stats-test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there is a detailed description in related the ticket (see below) on how to trigger the problem.  Feel free to kick the tires.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes #4560\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Overview\r\n\r\nA `_find` request can run for a very long time (on large databases when the selector matches no index) and this continues even if the client disconnects.\r\n\r\nWe want to stop the fabric work when there is no client to receive the result. `fabric_streams` already kills the workers if the coordinating process dies but in this circumstance it does not.\r\n\r\nthis PR enhances (and renames) the existing cleanup process to be a watchdog. If enabled, the watchdog needs to be kicked regularly (by whatever activity we think indicates its worth continuing) or it will terminate the process it is watching, and kill the worker processes also.\r\n\r\nCurrently only `mango_httpd:handle_find_req` enables the watchdog and it only kicks the watchdog when it enqueues a row to be returned (i.e, only on selector matches).\r\n\r\nFurther work is being considered to directly detect a client disconnect and that might replace this approach. The reason detecting client disconnect is difficult is because the socket is in passive mode (and thus `monitor(port, MochiSocket)` and other ideas do not work).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n* start dev/run with log level debug\r\n* make a database with millions of empty documents\r\n* change `[fabric] idle_stream_timeout` to some low number of seconds\r\n* in a terminal run `curl -i 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/_find' -H content-type:application/json -d '{\"selector\":{\"foo\":\"bar\"}}'`\r\n\r\nI intend to add automated tests for this but wanted to get the diff in front of the team first.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [

The problem has been reported here #4706\r\n\r\nIt seems that we are facing one of the incompatibility problems documented in the Elixir 1.15 release notes\r\n\r\n> Potential incompatibilities\r\nDue to the code path pruning, if you have an application or dependency that does not specify its dependencies on Erlang and Elixir application, it may no longer compile successfully in Elixir v1.15. You can temporarily disable code path pruning by setting prune_code_paths: false in your mix.exs, although doing so may lead to runtime bugs that are only manifested inside a [mix release](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15/Mix.Tasks.Release.html).\r\n\r\nPrevious to this PR, if we try to run the elixir test suite with Elixir 1.15, the following error appears in any test that uses `jiffy`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> make clean couch elixir\r\n\r\n 1) test Basic reduce functions (ReduceTest)\r\n     test/elixir/test/reduce_test.exs:16\r\n     ** (UndefinedFunctionError) function :jiffy.decode/2 is undefined (module :jiffy is not available)\r\n     stacktrace:\r\n       (jiffy 1.0.9) :jiffy.decode(\"{\\\"ok\\\":true}\\n\", [:return_maps])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR indroduces the suggested temporary fix in the `mix.exs` by adding `prune_code_paths: false` to the build config. With this change we can use Elixir 1.15 in our build process. I've tried to find the problem with our dependency declaration without sucess. This should be a temporary solution until we find the root of the problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a second change in the Makefile clean target by adding aditional cleanup for elixir build artifacts. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provide any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n- Install Erlang >= 24\r\n- Install Elixir 1.15\r\n- `make clean couch elixir`\r\n\r\nThe elixir test suite should run without problems. Then check the cleanup.\r\n\r\n- `make clean`\r\n- `find . -name \"_build\"` (No _build folder should be found)\r\n- `MIX_ENV=integration mix deps` (should inform that every dependency needs to be compiled/updated)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n<!-- If your changes affect multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.
