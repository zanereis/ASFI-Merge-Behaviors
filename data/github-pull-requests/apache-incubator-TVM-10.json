this PR, dynamic shapes require upper bound of variables to be provided in order to use storage planning. We can relax this requirement, for shapes with unknown bound, we can look up other tensors with the same symbolic shapes. This can be helpful for deep learning models where the layers with the same configurations are usually repeated since there are many objects with the same shapes.\r\n\r\nThis PR changed the `StorageToken` to use `PrimExpr` bytes which can be integer or symbolic. For symbolic shapes, we put the tokens into a special buckets for looking up.\r\n\r\ncc @MasterJH5574 @tqchen

Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to enhance model optimization by combining parts of Ansor and AutoTVM. The proposed approach involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Execution of Ansor over an end-to-end model that requires optimization.\r\n\r\n2.  Selection of the best implementation identified by Ansor for the given model.\r\n\r\n3. Utilization of AutoTVM's Droplet Search to exploit the selected candidate.\r\n\r\nBy integrating Ansor with AutoTVM's Droplet Search ([droplet paper](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/publications/papers/DropletSearch.pdf)), we anticipate a reduction in the number of trials explored by Ansor while still achieving faster kernel performance. Our experimentation has demonstrated significant improvements in kernel speed with reduced search times across various architectures, including Nvidia A100, Nvidia 3080, AMD x86, and ARM A64FX. The results can be found in this report: [bennu paper](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~michaelcanesche/paper/bennu_paper.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Proposed Changes\r\n\r\n- Integration of Ansor and Droplet Search methodologies.\r\n\r\n- Utilization of Droplet Search to exploit the best candidates identified by Ansor.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this pull request is to streamline the model optimization process by leveraging the complementary strengths of Ansor and Droplet Search. By combining these techniques, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of kernel search and optimization, ultimately improving overall model performance across different hardware architectures.\r\n\r\n## Testing and Validation\r\n\r\nExtensive testing has been conducted to validate the efficacy and performance improvements achieved through the integration of Ansor and Droplet Search. Benchmarking tests have been performed across Nvidia A100, AMD x86, and ARM A64FX architectures to assess the impact on kernel speed and search time reduction compared with 10,000 trials from Ansor execution. These results are available in Section 3 of this manuscript: [bennu paper](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~michaelcanesche/paper/bennu_paper.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThis pull request builds upon prior research and experimentation in model optimization. The proposed approach improves end-to-end models across diverse hardware platforms while still reducing Ansor's search time. We welcome the community’s feedback, suggestions, and contributions to further refine and enhance these methodologies.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMichael Canesche, Gaurav Verma, and Fernando

pipeline.**\r\n\r\nTo enable using plugin in compile pipeline, the plugin manager is used together with MSC Manager. Plugin manager handles the converter of plugin from training framework to relax. Codegen parts are also modified for code generation.\r\n\r\nThis PR add necessary codes in MSC. To enable using plugin in pipeline, relax.frontend.torch.from_fx should also be changed, which will be included in next PR.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

The support was added to the [Flash-Decoding kernel](https://pytorch.org/blog/flash-decoding/), which we haven't used so far. \r\n\r\nThis PR lets us use Flash Decoding with paged KV cache support from TVM. We already use other kernels from Flash attention via BYOC, but due to the specialized nature of this kernel, it is supported as a contrib kernel (similar to vllm).\r\n\r\nSee also

The only released thing is entry's shape, since the params data in entries should be maintained by graph executor's storage pool.\r\n\r\nDue to that, data in entries created without `TVMNDArray_CreateView` is not released and causes memory leaks.\r\nTo fix this issue the graph executor params loading function is changed to load params into storage.\r\n\r\nThere is also minor issue with `is_linked_param` addressed in this commit.

is a reapplication of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15954, after resolving the breakages that required reverting in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16442.  The regex matching is now implemented without the `#include <regex>` from the C++ stdlib, to avoid ABI incompatibility with pytorch.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the `DecomposeOpsForTraining` transform directly replaced `relax.nn.batch_norm` into more primitive relax operations.  This required the decomposed form of `relax.nn.batch_norm` to be duplicated with `DecomposeOpsForInference`.  This commit refactors the pass to occur in two steps, first to apply training-specific mutations, and then to decompose.\r\n\r\nHaving a clear `DecomposeOps` pass also has a clear single location for operator decomposition, which may be migrated into the operator definition in the future, similar to `FLegalize`.","created_at":"2024-01-24T15:24:19Z","updated_at":"2024-02-06T14:02:43Z","closed_at":"2024-02-06T14:02:40Z","merged_at":"2024-02-06T14:02:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"8da3de1522e2caa080c61a0dbe3faa9ab93bacf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16465/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16465/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16465/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/af8613dcaf3de956632588cac832fb16d7799620","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:transform_decompose_ops_for_training","ref":"transform_decompose_ops_for_training","sha":"af8613dcaf3de956632588cac832fb16d7799620","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

Previously, `FuseTIR` removed all `PrimFunc`s that are not marked public other than those that can be handled in fusion. The permanent solution to this issue would be to handle these `PrimFunc`s in `FuseTIR` and `FuseOps`, which I am planning to attempt, but that should not be a blocker on using in-place `PrimFunc`s with those passes (which are part of the compilation pipeline).","created_at":"2024-01-24T04:36:24Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T03:12:08Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T03:12:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f798884c6dcc99eb88502b52e063e3e85511910d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bea5f56ccaec3cbdb98a1675f41b3b4e4afa0520","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:inplace-global-symbol","ref":"inplace-global-symbol","sha":"bea5f56ccaec3cbdb98a1675f41b3b4e4afa0520","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open

a dynamic model is frequently called with specific arguments or shapes of arguments, performance may be improved by generating to specialized versions of the model.  Previously, specialized versions of a relax function `func` could be generated using `func.bind_params` and `func.bind_symbolic_vars`.  However, use of these specialized versions requires the calling scope to explicitly check the preconditions of each kernel and call the appropriate one.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements a new utility, `check_for_special_case`, which handles both the generating of the special case, and checking whether the special case applies.  The function's user-facing signature is unmodified, while internally it delegates to either the original function or the specialized version depending on the result of the check.  This allows optimized kernels for specific static shapes to be introduced solely by changing the optimization pipeline, with no changes required in the calling scope.","created_at":"2024-01-23T16:08:47Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T16:09:46Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c943d38e34a59145343ac0d9d56a110b3b803dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4d9fd34000799ba38a1e318da60742feec50761a","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:function_check_for_special_case","ref":"function_check_for_special_case","sha":"4d9fd34000799ba38a1e318da60742feec50761a","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces two changes to the (paged) KV cache:\r\n\r\nThe first is introducing RoPE mode to PagedKVCache. Right now there are two modes: normal/inline. In \"normal\" mode, RoPE will be applied to input Q/K/V data before appending the K/V data to cache. In \"inline\" mode, the input K/V data is directly appending to cache, and the RoPE will be on-the-fly applied inside attention kernel. The main purpose of introducing RoPE mode is to balance the need of on-the-fly RoPE (in cases like Mistral where positions can cahnge) and the attention kernel performance.\r\n\r\nThe second is introducing a new interface `AttentionWithFusedQKV` to KV cache. This function takes the input QKV data that is fused along the head dimension. And the fused QKV will be split into separate Q/K/V internally (note: requiring external workspace passed in). We introduce this function since in practice we note that when RoPE mode is \"normal,\" it offers better performance if we fuse the QKV split and RoPE

to this commit, `FuseOps` and `FuseOpsByPattern` exposed a symbolic variable to the fused function if it was used within the fused function, but wasn't inferable from other parameter shapes. While this prevents undefined symbolic variables, it can cause issues for downstream use of `CodegenJSON`, which requires all arguments to be tensors, or tuple of tensors.\r\n\r\nFrequently, all uses of a non-inferable symbolic shape occur within a symbolic expression that can be inferred.  For example, a function that takes `arg: R.Tensor([N+1])` and returns `R.add(arg, R.const(1))` cannot infer `N`.  However, all occurrences of `N` occur as part of the expression `N+1`, and the value of `N+1` can be inferred.  Therefore, if we replace `N+1` with `M`, the additional `ShapeTuple` argument isn't required.\r\n\r\nIn addition, prior to this commit, the `CompositeFunctionAnnotator` visited the body of functions without the parameters being considered in-scope.  As a result, `EraseToWellDefined` would remove known shapes from the function body's `StructInfo`.","created_at":"2024-01-22T17:38:55Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:15:00Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T00:15:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/db735e3d8a2e60a8f2ed603b2342d72f2e16bc7b","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_fuse_ops_symbolic_var","ref":"unity_fuse_ops_symbolic_var","sha":"db735e3d8a2e60a8f2ed603b2342d72f2e16bc7b","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

pull request serves as an enhancement to Dlight. This update primarily focuses on incorporating hardware information to recommend tile candidates, which enables fast tuning. \r\n\r\nBelow is a brief summary of the major changes:\r\n\r\n- Introduce dl.ApplyFastTuning Pass\r\n\r\n- new flag for skip_simplify `schedule::reindex` : This addition can help avoid over-optimization of eliminating unit loops. This flag functions similarly to `preserve_unit_loop`.\r\n\r\n- improve compute_inline.cc to enhance the simplification on some complex inline case (e.g. layout transform)\r\n\r\n- simple bug fixes:\r\n    - #16406 \r\n    - #16437 \r\n\r\nRelated discussion: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/dlight-enabling-fast-and-efficient-kernel-generation-by-leveraging-hardware-information/16273\r\n\r\nTODO Items of this pull request:\r\n- [ ] provide related testing.\r\n- [ ] code style may need guidance (e.g. remove or replace the log print; refactor some python components to cpp)\r\n- [x] leverage structural equal cache to avoid duplicated tuning.\r\n- [x] implement mma schedule template with swizzling.\r\n- [x] support dynamic symbolic tuning\r\n- [ ] bring it to mlc-llm (maybe should improve our design to support dynamic symbolic).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-20T18:10:48Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T17:03:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7df35c3561f4d8df9c19054ccb184001eddcffc0","head":{"label":"LeiWang1999:dev/fast_dlight","ref":"dev/fast_dlight","sha":"7df35c3561f4d8df9c19054ccb184001eddcffc0","user":{"login":"LeiWang1999","id":34334180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzM0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34334180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":615660601,"node_id":"R_kgDOJLI8OQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"LeiWang1999/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeiWang1999","id":34334180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzM0MTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34334180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999","html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeiWang1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeiWang1999/tvm","description":"Open

to this PR, `tanh(x)`returns `NaN` on metal when `x > 45.0`.\r\n\r\nMetal's built-in tanh is implemented as `(t - 1.0) / (t + 1.0)`, where `t = exp(2.0 * x)`. Hence for large `x`, `t` becomes `inf`, causing `tanh(x)` to be `NaN`.\r\n\r\nA numerically stable `tanh` is implemented for `llvm`, this PR lifts it to `src/target/intrin_rule.cc` and apply the same rule for metal as well.","created_at":"2024-01-19T19:48:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-20T06:30:44Z","closed_at":"2024-01-20T06:30:44Z","merged_at":"2024-01-20T06:30:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffa404fb48b9445cc3490d343f76442c01aef46d","assignee":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c1fb0108107fcda86bc09a97993240ef933aaa41","head":{"label":"CharlieFRuan:pr-0119-metal-tanh","ref":"pr-0119-metal-tanh","sha":"c1fb0108107fcda86bc09a97993240ef933aaa41","user":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":717204711,"node_id":"R_kgDOKr-s5w","name":"tvm","full_name":"CharlieFRuan/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan/tvm","description":"

target features are determined by a set of fixed checks on the target string. This works well for checking support of a small number of simple features, but it doesn't scale. Some problems include:\r\n- There are many non-trivial conditions for which a feature may(not) be available. It is easy to miss these with the current implementation.\r\n- The inclusion of some features in a target string can imply other features. For example, \"+sve2\" implies \"+sve\". This currently isn't taken into account.\r\n- The tests in tests/cpp/target/parsers/aprofile_test.c suggest that targets such as \"llvm -mcpu=cortex-a+neon\" and \"llvm -mattr=+noneon\" are supported target strings. The features will be correctly parsed in TVM, however, they are not valid in LLVM. Therefore, it's possible that TVM and LLVM have different understanding of the features available.\r\n\r\nThis commit uses the more robust LLVM target parser to determine support for the features in TVM. It leverages previous infrastructure added to TVM for obtaining a list of all supported features given an input target, and uses this to check the existance of certain features we're interested in. It should be trivial to grow this list over time. As a result of this change, the problems mentioned above are solved.\r\n\r\nIn the current form, this commit drops support for target strings such as \"llvm -mcpu=cortex-a+neon\" and \"llvm -mattr=+noneon\". A scan of the codebase suggests this functionality is not in use (only in test cases). Should we feel the need to support them, or have a smoother migration for downstream users of TVM we can add a translator to the parser to convert these into LLVM compatible targets.\r\n\r\ncc

the pytorch wheels available through `pip install` use the pre-C++11 ABI by setting `-DUSE_CXX11_ABI=0` [0].  If TVM were to user the pre-C++11 ABI, this would cause breakages with dynamically-linked LLVM environments.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a lint check to search for use of `#include <regex>` in any C++ files.  Use of this header should be avoided, as its implementation is not supported by gcc's dual ABI.  This ABI incompatibility results in runtime errors either when `std::regex` is called from TVM, or when `std::regex` is called from pytorch, depending on which library was loaded first.\r\n\r\nThis restriction can be removed when a version of pytorch compiled using `-DUSE_CXX11_ABI=1` is available from PyPI.\r\n\r\n[0]

to this commit, symbolic variables used by a lambda function would be duplicated between the caller and the lifted-out function. In addition, shape inference within the lifted-out function was performed without access to the symbolic variables, resulting in unnecessary fallback from `R.Tensor([m, n])` to `R.Tensor(ndim=2)`.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `LambdaLift` transform to handle symbolic variables.  All symbolic variables have unique definitions across the resulting `IRModule`, and shape inference in the lifted-out function is aware of symbolic variables that have been exposed to it.","created_at":"2024-01-16T15:44:59Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T16:09:37Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T16:09:34Z","merged_at":"2024-01-23T16:09:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"7789b248fbe0776fc29efdc0d772a0deeb95f8a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/43b7f8cdf59eae6bd6be94ebaa8dcffafa70d3e4","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_lambda_lift_symbolic_vars","ref":"unity_lambda_lift_symbolic_vars","sha":"43b7f8cdf59eae6bd6be94ebaa8dcffafa70d3e4","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a fix of `LowerCrossThreadReduction`: The pass will remove all the loops with thread bind under the inter thread reduction block, which will introduce some issues when we meet the case where there could be other non-reduction blocks under the reduction thread.\r\n\r\nBefore removing a thread-bound loop, check if the block(s) under this loop has reduction block var. If the block(s) under have reduction do not have any reduction block var, it means that block is not reduction, and therefore this thread-bound loop should be kept. Otherwise, we remove the thread-bound loop as usual.\r\n\r\nrelated discussion:

#16345 introduced a TIR intrinsic `tvm_thread_invariant` as a no-op intrinsic that indicates that a condition is an invariant across threads. It is a necessary change to support MoE group GEMM operations.\r\n\r\nHowever, we noticed that the LLVM-ROCm backend has been broken since then because this no-op intrinsic hasn't been properly handled in this particular backend.

`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` variable. It also fixes the issue if TVM cmake was called from directory with another cmake project.","created_at":"2024-01-12T11:56:33Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:57Z","closed_at":"2024-01-15T06:46:48Z","merged_at":"2024-01-15T06:46:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe9814c73e24df3ecd031b216492fb555a1ab95a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4eb9d880fd049730f452a651419bf73b7abdab1b","head":{"label":"apache:echuraev/fix_cmake_issue_for_opencl_tests","ref":"echuraev/fix_cmake_issue_for_opencl_tests","sha":"4eb9d880fd049730f452a651419bf73b7abdab1b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open
