To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-26T10:35:29Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T11:45:34Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T10:48:46Z","merged_at":"2020-03-26T10:48:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b78fe00f6ded8e4f267138c4bbc32c04fc37b0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1cee4a27d0bb9fc3864576f42fa6def843938c68","head":{"label":"jingwen-ywb:jingwen-20200326-echo","ref":"jingwen-20200326-echo","sha":"1cee4a27d0bb9fc3864576f42fa6def843938c68","user":{"login":"jingwen-ywb","id":53991270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTkxMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53991270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb","html_url":"https://github.com/jingwen-ywb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":201733074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDE3MzMwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"jingwen-ywb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jingwen-ywb","id":53991270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTkxMjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53991270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb","html_url":"https://github.com/jingwen-ywb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingwen-ywb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jingwen-ywb/flink","description":"Apache

writing to Hive tables\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen inserting to a partition, Hive will update the partition's SD according to table SD. For example, consider the following use case:\r\n```\r\ncreate table foo (x int,y int) partitioned by (p string);\r\ninsert overwrite table foo partition (p='1') select * from ...;\r\nalter table foo set fileformat rcfile;\r\ninsert overwrite table foo partition (p='1') select * from ...;\r\n```\r\nThe second INSERT will write RC files to the partition and therefore the partition SD needs to be updated to use RC file input format. Otherwise we hit exception when reading from this partition.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add new interface to alter partition in `TableMetaStore`.\r\n  - Alter existing partition in `PartitionLoader`.\r\n  - Add test case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change fixes unit test \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change fixes unit test \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\nno to all \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-25T23:53:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T20:33:11Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T11:19:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c8d5d34961e951b52075aae5151844ce494fc1e","assignee":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278672464,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4NjcyNDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=FileSystems","name":"component=FileSystems","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0ad71f6f67c7fef6c94b0764a1ff2419d039fee4","head":{"label":"qqibrow:fixprestofx","ref":"fixprestofx","sha":"0ad71f6f67c7fef6c94b0764a1ff2419d039fee4","user":{"login":"qqibrow","id":441984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow","html_url":"https://github.com/qqibrow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250116202,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTAxMTYyMDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"qqibrow/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqibrow","id":441984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow","html_url":"https://github.com/qqibrow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqibrow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_t

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues).

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf an exception is thrown from task's async checkpoint process, the checkpoint will be declined as expected, but the reason for declining checkpoint will be regarded as #CheckpointFailureReason.JOB_FAILURE, which gives a wrong message to users. We should replace #CheckpointFailureReason.JOB_FAILURE with #CheckpointFailureReason.EXCEPTION, otherwise user will see \"The job has failed\" on Checkpoint UI.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUse #CheckpointException to wrap the exception thrown from #AsyncCheckpointRunnable.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nA trival rework without testing.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nThis change will correct the error message when circumstances mentioned above happen.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nNo

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fix the ClassNotFoundException  flink-sql-connector-elasticsearch7*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Correct the shade exclusions*\r\n  - *Exclude Log4j-charsets.properties file when shade*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Add end-to-end test in test_sql_client.sh for elasticsearch7*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `CheckpointBarrierUnaligner` as a central building block to unaligned checkpoints, which allows checkpoint barriers to overtake inflight data and write inflight data as part of a checkpoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Making all channel-related classes aware of their index and allow positional access to all related classes (gates, input channels, (sub)partitions).\r\n- Adding feature toggle (turned off by default)\r\n- Allow buffers and barriers on input channels be handled by `CheckpointBarrierUnaligner`\r\n- Adding the basic `CheckpointBarrierUnaligner`\r\n- Allow checkpoint barriers to overtake input and output buffers\r\n- Passing inflight input and output buffers that have been skipped to the ChannelStateWriter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests for non-trivial commits (WIP)\r\n- Added basic integration tests (smoke tests for now as the actual persisting of data is not implemented)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo add proper file extension when compression is enabled.\r\n\r\nWhen `hive.exec.compress.output` is on, we write into Hive tables with a compression codec. But we don't append a proper extension to the resulting files, which means these files can't be consumed later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Support setting file extension in `FileSystemOutputFormat`, and use the extension in `PartitionTempFileManager`.\r\n  - Decide file extension by calling Hive util method.\r\n  - Refactor code.\r\n  - Add test case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-25T08:15:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T03:13:26Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T03:05:30Z","merged_at":"2020-03-27T03:05:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"6758ee33ef7fd87d53e97459d293fa38700c9085","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ac9478ae19478ac09f82e91a25c7622fb3c0aa81","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-16647-1.10","ref":"FLINK-16647-1.10","sha":"ac9478ae19478ac09f82e91a25c7622fb3c0aa81","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix reading Hive tables with RegexSerDe.\r\nRegexSerDe initialization fails with NPE. It's because we don't properly generate the table properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Create table properties by calling Hive util method\r\n  - Keep the table properties in `HiveTablePartition` and use it to initialize SerDe\r\n  - Add test case\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added test case\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

ARTIFACTS_DIR.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-24T14:33:46Z","updated_at":"2020-03-25T18:35:56Z","closed_at":"2020-03-25T18:35:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05d26f3345c10ba8534f42727a86f97db619aeb2","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278805855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODA1ODU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TestInfrastructure","name":"component=TestInfrastructure","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1883016275,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODgzMDE2Mjc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem/AzurePipelines","name":"component=BuildSystem/AzurePipelines","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11501/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11501/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11501/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/67ae0e8ccb38f9612cc04399e8ab4af922e320b2","head":{"label":"rmetzger:FLINK-16480-pr","ref":"FLINK-16480-pr","sha":"67ae0e8ccb38f9612cc04399e8ab4af922e320b2","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20618957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxODk1Nw==","name":"flink","full_name":"rmetzger/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https:

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe [node-selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/) is a collection of key/value pairs to constrain a pod to only be able to run on particular node(s).

PR picks [pull-11247](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/11247) to release-1.10.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the issue that `str_to_map` fails if it returns a constant value.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - If a Hive UDF returns a constant value, i.e. the result OI is a constant OI, just use the constant writable value from the OI.\r\n  - Add test case for `str_to_map`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

decimal type with precision < 10\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`TypeDescription::DEFAULT_SCALE` is 10. `OrcSplitReaderUtil::logicalTypeToOrcType` sets precision before it sets scale. So if we create a decimal type with precision<10, it'll cause an exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Sets scale first in OrcSplitReaderUtil::logicalTypeToOrcType.\r\n  - Add test for decimal type.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test case\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, Flink only snapshots and stores operator state. For the Unaligned Checkpoints, channel state needs to be stored as well. This PR adds channel state handles to checkpoint metadata and updates state assignment on recovery.\r\n\r\nThe metadata is added on the `OperatorSubtaskState` level: each operator has in and out channel states. Currently, only head and tail operators in the chain will have `in` and `out` states respectively (topology change is not supported).\r\nAn alternative approach (implemented [here](https://github.com/rkhachatryan/flink/tree/uc-state-metadata)) would be to add channel state on the `TaskStateSnapshot` level. While it looks simpler from the Task perspective; it requires some artificial binding in `CompletedCheckpoint` to allow assignment on recovery.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - some pre-requisite refactorings\r\n - add channel state metadata to OperatorSubtaskState\r\n - adjust StateAssignmentOperation\r\n - adjust metadata serialization\r\n - adjust related classes\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing (modified) tests, such as:\r\n - CheckpointCoordinatorFailureTest\r\n - LocalStateForwardingTest\r\n - OperatorSnapshotFinalizerTest\r\n - OperatorSnapshotFuturesTest\r\n - RestoreStreamTaskTest\r\n - StreamTaskTest\r\n\r\nAnd new tests:\r\n- `ChannelStateNoRescalingPartitionerTest`\r\n- `StateAssignmentOperationTest#testChannelStateAssignmentStability`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no (not user-facing)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce config options to support to set labels and node-selector for JM/TM pods. \r\n* The [labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) are key/value pairs that will be attached to the JM/TM pod.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Support to set labels\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Unit tests\r\n* Manually test in a real cluster\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUse headless service instead of  node port when run flink job on kubernetes for better performance and compatibility。\r\n\r\nFirst, the RPC and blob only need a headless service which could avoid iptables or ipvs forwarding. \r\n\r\nSecond，serverless K8S(like AWS EKS) in public cloud does not support Node Port，which cause some problem when running flink On serverless K8S.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\nUse headless service instead of  node port when run flink job on kubernetes. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `DispatcherBootstrap` which will contain the \"initial\" state of the dispatcher. This means that upon dispatcher initialisation `Dispatcher#onStart()`, the `DispatcherBoootstrap#initialize()` method will be called to initialise it.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in the case of the dispatcher of a session cluster, the bootstrap will re-launch the recovered job graphs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIntroduces the `DispatcherBootstrap` interface with a default implementation for the current `StandaloneDispatcher` and `MiniDispatcher` which relaunched the recovered (or submitted) `JobGraph`s.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAlready covered by tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAt the moment there are four fields initialized in the method of StreamTask#beforeInvoke, such as `stateBackend`, `checkpointStorage`, `timerService`, `asyncOperationsThreadPool`.\r\n\r\nIn general it is suggested to use final fields to get known benefits. So we can refactor the StreamTask to initialize these fields in the constructor instead.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Migrate some files initialization from `#beforeInvoke` to constructor.*\r\n  - *Remove the `null` conditions for related fields in `StreamTask`*\r\n  - *Add throw `Exception` for some related classes*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe Flink semantics of a counter are not matching with the counters\r\nin DataDog. In Flink a counter counts the total of increment and\r\ndecrement calls. In DataDog a counter is the number of increment\r\nand decrement calls during the reporting interval.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changed DCounter to report a delta since the last report and not the total value\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\nThere is an existing unit test for the datadog metrics component. No change was done to it.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-22T18:16:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T09:08:53Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T09:08:53Z","merged_at":"2020-03-26T09:08:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"69f20e929b9f6c58b3220dd41b41b21ad5f4bcdd","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1ac54f0d5858be27c66f55fb56b96664f4252256","head":{"label":"kottmann:flink_15438","ref":"flink_15438","sha":"1ac54f0d5858be27c66f55fb56b96664f4252256","user":{"login":"kottmann","id":1217786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTc3ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1217786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann","html_url":"https://github.com/kottmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kottmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b17d01ba8022398b40075174c9fc288c552910f6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.git

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd a set command to set job name when submit job on sql client\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nadd a set command to set job name when submit job on sql client\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-22T08:29:05Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T08:24:12Z","closed_at":"2020-12-10T08:24:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea212368a66a1ec10fd6d2b532bded47b42ef2eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0c3ff299be5c73bde33fff8975dde454f483aa50","head":{"label":"zhangjun0x01:flink-sql-client-jobname","ref":"flink-sql-client-jobname","sha":"0c3ff299be5c73bde33fff8975dde454f483aa50","user":{"login":"zhangjun0x01","id":25563794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTYzNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25563794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246776709,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDY3NzY3MDk=","name":"flink","full_name":"zhangjun0x01/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangjun0x01","id":25563794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTYzNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25563794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request adds support for ORC BulkWriter for the `StreamingFileSink`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add OrcBulkWriter that uses ORC's `WriterImpl` and a slightly customised implementation of ORC's `PhysicalWriter` to write elements in the form of `VectorizerRowBatch`.\r\n  - Add OrcBulkWriterFactory to create an instance of ORCBulkWriter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added an integration test to test this writer and also to verify that no Serialization related exception is thrown.\r\n  - Added a unit test to test this new writer\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running on a cluster with a streaming source, and writing to the filesystem\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **don't know**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, in `YarnClusterDescriptor#startAppMaster,` we first write out and upload the Flink Configuration file, then start to write out the JobGraph file and set its name into the Flink Configuration object, the setting is not written into the Flink Configuration file so that it does not take effect in the cluster side.\r\n\r\nThis ticket proposes to write out the JobGraph file before the Configuration file to ensure that the setting of FileJobGraphRetriever.JOB_GRAPH_FILE_PATH works on the cluster side.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage and could be verified manually by submitting a per job to the yarn cluster successfully.\r\n`./bin/flink run -d -e yarn-per-job

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n- user can implement  JobListener and register by conf. it will be convinient for users to port with other system ,such as atlas\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- i have unit test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes**)\r\n  - The serializers: no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request supports for defining scopes and variables on Python metric group, i.e., adding `get_metric_group()` on `FunctionContext`, adding `add_group` in `MetricGroup`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds `get_metric_group()` on `FunctionContext`\r\n  - Adds `add_group` in `MetricGroup`\r\n  - Adds `python.metric.enabled` configuration to enable or disable metric for Python UDFs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Adds tests in `testUDFProtoConstructedProperlyForSingleUDF` to verify the metric group proto info.\r\n  - Adds test_metric to verify operations in Python MetricGroup.\r\n  - Adds test_metric_it_case to verify metric group info which is passed from Java to Python\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (PythonDocs, Note: more documentation will be added in [FLINK-16674](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-16674))\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-21T07:49:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T12:51:38Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T12:50:29Z","merged_at":"2020-03-26T12:50:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb67adcacd6e7270e4c5c5841d282f234d34ba9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cd7f5ca1b3d716a5e34ba4256a33c6817f125480","head":{"label":"hequn8128:metricGroup","ref":"metricGroup","sha":"cd7f5ca1b3d716a5e34ba4256a33c6817f125480","user":{"login":"hequn8128","id":4971479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128","html_url":"https://github.com/hequn8128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72620237,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MjYyMDIzNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"hequn8128/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hequn8128","id":4971479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128","html_url":"https://github.com/hequn8128","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hequn8128/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hequn8128/flink","description":"Mirror

Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Inline `ClientUtils#submitJob(client, jobGraph)` since it is no more than `client.submit(jobGraph).get()` and we don't likely to change the behavior. What's more, the interesting stuff is often `JobID` instead of `JobSubmissionResult` which is no more than a thin wrapper of `JobID`\r\n- Move `ClientUtils#submitJobAndWaitForResult` since it is no more used in product scope.\r\n- Remove tests dedicated for these two utils.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is about tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request support dynamic index in elasticsearch table sink.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Import IndexFormatter to extract index*\r\n  - *Improve ElasticsearchUpsertSinkFunction to support dynamic index.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Add unit tests in IndexFormatterTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n   docs\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-20T15:54:38Z","updated_at":"2020-04-18T14:42:49Z","closed_at":"2020-04-18T14:42:49Z","merged_at":"2020-04-18T14:42:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1a21c6d3853fb6feb9c91a59952bc0095d5b29f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273431901,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDMxOTAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/ElasticSearch","name":"component=Connectors/ElasticSearch","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11466/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11466/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11466/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7999653a0fd426a2edff271a87a5a69f4e1c54dc","head":{"label":"leonardBang:FLINK-15400_dynamicIndex","ref":"FLINK-15400_dynamicIndex","sha":"7999653a0fd426a2edff271a87a5a69f4e1c54dc","user":{"login":"leonardBang","id":5163645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5163645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang","html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64203606,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDIwMzYwNg==","name":"flink","full_name":"leonardBang/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leonardBang","id":5163645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5163645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang","html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe `EmbeddedExecutor` is part of the [FLIP-85](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-85+Flink+Application+Mode) effort,  which aims at giving the user the option of running his/her `main` method on the cluster, rather than the client. \r\n\r\nRunning the user's main method in \"Application Mode\" implies:\r\n1) launching a dedicated cluster for the application's jobs\r\n2) running the user's main on the cluster, alongside the Dispatcher\r\n\r\nThe `EmbeddedExecutor` is an `Executor` which is assumed to run alongside the `Dispatcher` of the cluster, on the same machine.  Conceptually, it is like the existing `Executors` for session clusters, with the difference that this time there is no need to go through REST as this will be running already on the same machine as the Dispatcher.\r\n\r\nGiven that the Web Submission already runs the user's `main` on the cluster, this PR apart from introducing the `EmbeddedExecutor`, it also wires it to the `JarRunHandler` so that:\r\n1) we can test the executor already\r\n2) we get (partially for now) rid of the pattern of throwing `ProgramAbortException` in order to extract the `JobGraph`. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee the description above.\r\nIt introduces the `EmbeddedExecutor` with a custom `PipelineExecutorLoader` which is only aware of this executor and is used in the `JarRunHandler`. \r\n\r\nThe handler now, instead of extracting the `JobGraph` itself and submitting to the `Dispatcher`, now it executes the user's main method and let's the new executor do the job graph extraction and submission. \r\n\r\nTo not block any threads on the web frontend, we launch the job in `detached` mode, which is reasonable, as web submission is expected to be a \"fire-and-forget\" action, and also it is compatible with the current behaviour which does not return the results of operations like `collect()`, `count()` or `print()`. \r\n\r\nThe only difference compared to before is that now, a job with a `print()` will throw an exception (as is the case for detached submission from the CLI), rather than execute the job and silently return nothing.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt was tested manually on Yarn and local cluster and also it is tested through the updated tests for the `JarRunHandler`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-20T08:28:39Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:39:52Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T18:40:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"483aa21991d14cabfbbadc85ff7731b6df0eb817","assignee":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tisonkun","id":18818196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODE4MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18818196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun","html_url":"https://github.com/tisonkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tisonkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273465073,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDY1MDcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/REST","name":"component=Runtime/REST","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1536123478,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2MTIzNDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Client/JobSubmission","name":"component=Client/JobSubmission","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11460/com

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`BootstrapTools#getEnvironmentVariables` actually is a general utility to extract key-value pairs with specified prefix trimmed from the Flink Configuration object. It can not only be used to extract customized environment variables in the YARN setup but also for customized annotations/labels/node-selectors in the Kubernetes setup.\r\n\r\nThis ticket proposes to rename it to `ConfigurationUtils#getPrefixedKeyValuePairs` and move it to the flink-core module as a more general utility to share for the YARN/Kubernetes setup.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAt the moment we usually create two Services for a Flink application, one is the internal Service and the other is the so-called rest Service, the previous aims for forwarding request from the TMs to the JM, and the rest Service mainly serves as an external service for the Flink application. Here is a summary of the issues:\r\n\r\n1. The functionality boundary of the two Services is not clear enough since the internal Service could also become the rest Service when its exposed type is ClusterIP.\r\n2. For the high availability scenario, we create a useless internal Service which does not help forward the internal requests since the TMs directly communicate with the JM via the IP or hostname of the JM Pod.\r\n3. Headless service is enough to help forward the internal requests from the TMs to the JM. Service of ClusterIP type would add corresponding rules into the iptables, too many rules in the iptables would lower the kube-proxy's efficiency in refreshing iptables while notified of change events, which could possibly cause severe stability problems in a Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we propose some improvements to the current design:\r\n\r\n1. Clarify the functionality boundary for the two Services, the internal Service only serves the internal communication from TMs to JM, while the rest Service makes the Flink cluster accessible from outside. The internal Service only exposes the RPC and BLOB ports while the external one exposes the REST port.\r\n2. Do not create the internal Service in the high availability case.\r\n3. Use HEADLESS type for the internal Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added unit tests and can be verified on a real K8s cluster as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a non-HA session cluster and check there are two dedicated Services created, the internal one has NONE CLUSTER-IP.\r\n2. Deploy an HA session cluster and check only the rest Service is created.\r\n3. Check that the internal Service only exposes the RPC and BLOB port while the external one exposes the REST port.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request to fix the spelling mistakes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nfix the spelling mistakes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis pull request do not need test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix TableEnvironmentITCase.testClearOperation test failure\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Reset the collection data in `TestCollectionTableFactory`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCRON test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nNA\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-19T09:58:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T12:37:57Z","closed_at":"2020-03-19T12:32:19Z","merged_at":"2020-03-19T12:32:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"e19bc924a7a6c7e4522b850e2020e2dc4847da57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e1c643b9012d7759332437ecb7902dcdc073ab8d","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-16675-master","ref":"FLINK-16675-master","sha":"e1c643b9012d7759332437ecb7902dcdc073ab8d","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix TableEnvironmentITCase.testClearOperation test failure\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Reset the collection data in `TestCollectionTableFactory`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCRON test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  NA\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis fixes a regression in the DataStream API for being unable to call\r\n```\r\nDataStreamSource#setParallelism(-1)\r\n```\r\nwhich should set the cluster/job default. It was introduced by https://github.com/apache/flink/commit/4a5e8c083969cad215819ad6a3a0d2919e8c2d5e.\r\n\r\n@xintongsong actually, I'm also a bit unsure on some other things from that commit, like `OperatorValidationUtils#validateMaxParallelism(int, boolean)` using an upper bound of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` instead of `Transformation#UPPER_BOUND_MAX_PARALLELISM`. In the end, it is not too much of a problem since this is actually checked twice in `SingleOutputStreamOperator#setMaxParallelism`, once there and a second time in the transformation which uses the correct upper bound. In the end, that part was only copied from the old code which did not have an upper bound check there and therefore, I did not change this here either.\r\n\r\nWhen merging, please also apply to release-1.10\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- change `DataStreamSource#setParallelism()` to call `OperatorValidationUtils.validateParallelism` instead of `OperatorValidationUtils.validateMaxParallelism`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces new memory model and its configuration options for JM.\r\nThere is no behavioural change at the moment, only data structures for memory components are prepared and options are parsed to fill them.\r\nSee more details in [FLIP-116: Unified Memory Configuration for Job Managers](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP+116%3A+Unified+Memory+Configuration+for+Job+Managers).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce new memory JM options in `JobManagerOptions`\r\n  - Introduce `JobManagerProcessSpec` container for JM memory components\r\n  - Factor out common parts from `TaskExecutorProcessUtils` into `MemoryProcessUtils` which can be reused for JM (JVM components and arguments, some other common methods)\r\n  - Factor out common tests from `TaskExecutorProcessUtilsTest` into the base test suite `MemoryProcessUtilsTestBase`\r\n - Introduce `JobManagerProcessUtils` which parses new memory specific `JobManagerOptions` and calculates JM memory components as `JobManagerProcessSpec`\r\n - Introduce `JobManagerProcessUtilsTest` suite for `JobManagerProcessUtils`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable

on #10362 (FLINK-14792).\r\n\r\nWith this PR the ResourceManager tracks cluster partitions hosted on task executors, based on the `ClusterPartitionReports` that are already submitted via TE heartbeats.\r\n\r\nThe entire partition handling logic is encapsulated in a `ResourceManagerPartitionTracker`; the RM does not really do anything and just informs the tracker about certain events (arrival of a new report, shutdown of a TM, requested release of a partition via the REST API).\r\n\r\nThe tracker maintains the following mappings\r\na) data set -> TE\r\nb) TE -> data set\r\nc) TE -> partitions\r\n\r\nMapping a) is required for the release of partitions via the REST API.\r\nMapping b) is required for figuring out which data sets may be affected by a TE shutdown.\r\nMapping c) is required for detecting when all partitions of a partition are being tracked and whether a TE has lost a single partition.\r\n\r\nThe tracker not only tracks partitions but also searches for data sets that have been corrupted by the loss of partitions (e.g.,  because of a TE shutdown). In this case the tracker will issue release calls for the remaining partitions to the hosting task executors.\r\n\r\nNote that `ResourceManagerPartitionTracker#listDataSets` and  `#releastPartitions` are unused at this time, but are required for the upcoming REST API.\r\n\r\nThis PR does _NOT_ handle cases where a partition of a cluster partition is never being tracked, for example because the TE died just after the job finished. In this case we will currently never release partitions of the corresponding data set.\r\nThis will be tackled in a follow-up, and requires setting up a timeout for the maximum duration between the first and last registration of a partition.","created_at":"2020-03-18T14:23:06Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T15:16:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T15:14:47Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T15:14:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"e63c31ba8a28a609e385eb98a874c2abdf72a28e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c04e7d39c3d7b3ba8e6678d8bd193f7d7ce5405f","head":{"label":"zentol:14791","ref":"14791","sha":"c04e7d39c3d7b3ba8e6678d8bd193f7d7ce5405f","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zentol/flink","description":"Mirror

when it fails to translate the operation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTableEnvironmentImpl won't clear buffered operations if the translation throws an exception. This can cause problem for following DMLs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Always clear the buffered operations.\r\n  - Add test case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test case\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAt the moment there are at-least four implementations of `ResultPartitionWriter` interface used in unit tests. And there are about ten methods to be implemented for `ResultPartitionWriter` and most of them are dummy in tests.\r\n\r\nWhen we want to extend the methods for `ResultPartitionWriter`, the above four dummy implementations in tests have to be adjusted as well, to waste a bit efforts.\r\n\r\nTherefore the abstract ResultPartitionWriterTestBase is proposed to implement the basic dummy methods for `ResultPartitionWriter`, and the previous four instances can all extend it to only implement one or two methods based on specific requirements in tests. It will probably only need to adjust the ResultPartitionWriterTestBase when extending the `ResultPartitionWriter` interface.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce abstract ResultPartitionWriterTestBase to implement `ResultPartitionWriter`*\r\n  - Make previous related `ResultPartitionWriter` instances to extend `ResultPartitionWriterTestBase`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

to hive table with compression\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo add proper file extension when compression is enabled.\r\n\r\nWhen `hive.exec.compress.output` is on, we write into Hive tables with a compression codec. But we don't append a proper extension to the resulting files, which means these files can't be consumed later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Support setting file extension in `FileSystemOutputFormat`, and use the extension in `PartitionTempFileManager`.\r\n  - Decide file extension by calling Hive util method.\r\n  - Refactor code.\r\n  - Add test case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-18T12:05:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T03:09:09Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T03:04:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"679a85e0b624a267482e2af8a3a5695c3797167f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11440/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11440/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11440/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/11a740c2b5cc9391290a5c373ce68b1669a332e6","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-16647","ref":"FLINK-16647","sha":"11a740c2b5cc9391290a5c373ce68b1669a332e6","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the order in which the `CliFrontend` selects the active CLI command. \r\n\r\nCurrently in Flink there are 3 custom command lines, the `DefaultCLI`, the `FlinkYarnSessionCli` and the `ExecutorCLI` and when the user submits his/her CLI command, the `CliFrontend` selects which one to use (i.e. which one is active) for further processing based on criteria specific to each custom command line.\r\n\r\nThe `FlinkYarnSessionCli` is chosen if there is a file called `.yarn-properties-USERNAME`  (among other criteria) in a specific directory. This file can be written transparently to the user, if he/she used the CLI previously to launch a yarn session cluster. \r\n\r\nThe `ExecutorCLI` is activated if and only if there is an explicit `-e` flag specified by the user. \r\n\r\nGiven that currently Flink first checks if the yarn cli is active and, if not, it only then checks the `ExecutorCLI`, if this \"magic\" file exists from a previous run, there is no way for the user to use the `ExecutorCLI` without deleting the \"properties\" file, which may be useful in the future.\r\n\r\nGiven that in the case of the `ExecutorCLI`, an explicit action is required by the user to activate it, while this is not the case for the yarn cli, this PR aims at changing the order in which the cli's are checked for being activated or not.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChanges the order of loading the clis in the `CliFrontend.loadCustomCommandLines()`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded the `FlinkYarnSessionCliTest.testExecutorCLIisPrioritised()`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix the bug when read multiple orc file throw a NullPointerException\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - set the schema null  on method OrcInputFormat#closeInputFormat instead of method close\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the current WordCount example to have a SourceFunction that randomly generates input data based on a set of sentences, so the WordCount job can run forever. The generation interval is configurable.\r\n\r\nThis will be the easiest way to start a long running flink job and can be useful for new users to start using flink quickly, or for developers to test flink easily.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added a new SourceFunction `RandomSentenceSource` that generates random data continuously until cancellation*\r\n  - *Modified the WordCount example to use the `RandomSentenceSource` as the input optionally*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 1 node cluster with 1 JobManagers and 1 TaskManagers, submitted the new WordCount jobs with `--random` option with different intervals and verified the jobs worked correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nDesigned to fix business call FlinkKafkaConsumer's cacel function throw  CloseException\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n-Remove the KafkaFetcher call cancel method handover close call code \r\n   This is redundant code because the  handover maybe will wakeup on the KafkaConsumerThread call shutdown method and here will be throw CloseException when User call the cancel method.\r\n\r\n-when call the  handover close method on KafkaConsumerThread run end it should check the running flag if true.\r\n  the use call the cancel it will mark the running flag false then KafkaConsumerThread will break the main loop. it will throw CloseException in this case but the result is not  user excepted\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n  the calls Kafka010FetcherTest  covered this  changing test\r\n\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n      no\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n    no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nProblem: Builds on Azure where failing if S3 credentials were not provided, because the syntax in the pipeline definition was incorrect.\r\nThis mostly affected PR builds, because they don't have access to the credentials.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Use a way to access secret variables that leads to an empty value (instead of the variable name). Also, extend the check in the unit tests to \"variable empty\" instead of just \"variable not set\".\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI triggered a build [with](https://dev.azure.com/georgeryan1322/Flink/_build/results?buildId=178&view=results) and [without](https://dev.azure.com/georgeryan1322/Flink/_build/results?buildId=176&view=results) credentials + there is the test run of this PR.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nReduce hive source parallelism when limit push down\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReduce hive source parallelism when limit push down\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-17T12:12:24Z","updated_at":"2020-03-18T08:53:07Z","closed_at":"2020-03-18T08:53:07Z","merged_at":"2020-03-18T08:53:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4245bdcd2e9ba48cdab9760d8120df60aa0e2d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11429/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11429/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11429/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c3fe6c06b90a164641afa4557ccea372c6b72bec","head":{"label":"zhangjun0x01:flink-16413-1.10","ref":"flink-16413-1.10","sha":"c3fe6c06b90a164641afa4557ccea372c6b72bec","user":{"login":"zhangjun0x01","id":25563794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTYzNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25563794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246776709,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDY3NzY3MDk=","name":"flink","full_name":"zhangjun0x01/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangjun0x01","id":25563794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTYzNzk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25563794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangjun0x01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangjun0x01/flink","description":"Apache

This commit\r\nremoves the dependency management entries for these dependencies so that the\r\ninfluxdb reporter bundles the correct dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe `FlinkKubeClient` interface offers several methods which are synchronous (e.g. `FlinkKubeClient.createTaskManagerPod`, `FlinkKubeClient.stopPod`, `FlinkKubeClient.getPodsWithLabels`, etc). The problem is that these methods are directly used by the `KubernetesResourceManager` which calls them from the main thread. Since these methods perform I/O operations (sending and receiving network packages) they can potentially block the execution and hence should not happen from the `RpcEndpoint`'s main thread.\r\n\r\nSo the PR will make some interfaces the of FlinkKubeClient asynchronous, which potentially blocks the execution of RpcEndpoint's main thread. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Make `createTaskManagerPod` and `stopPod` asynchronous\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n* This PR will **NOT** introduce any behavior change. All the current unit tests, e2e tests should work correctly.\r\n* Manually test on a real K8s cluster for starting session, job submission, stop session, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-17T08:07:37Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T14:03:28Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T14:03:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd7969a2bb228e3875198e88aa42c8100f46a0fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5a6f63974423ed7573724093210a76f5caa717b7","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-15790","ref":"FLINK-15790","sha":"5a6f63974423ed7573724093210a76f5caa717b7","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918/flink","description":"Apache
