Description ##\r\nWhen detecting memory leaks on c++ inference code using ASAN, I have found that almost all of the leaks in ASAN reports come from unreleased memory in object pool. The [free code](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/common/object_pool.h#L135) is deliberately commented out to avoid program crash from accessing too early destructed objects in global singletons.\r\n\r\nThe main problem of object pool is fixed in #312, maybe there are still some underlying issues. I have re-added the free operation, and experienced no problems in several weeks' usage.\r\n\r\nI think the correct way is to just let problems happen, then we can fix them to approach leak-free codes.\r\n\r\nSince issues like #13265 are reported, some ASAN tests are suggested to be added in CI to assure absolutely no leaks in c++ interface.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T08:27:35Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T11:17:08Z","closed_at":"2019-02-21T11:17:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66a136b328306f057cd212dbc51f736452f03d91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":919645457,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTk2NDU0NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C%20API","name":"C

Description ##\r\n\r\nWhis is a Work in Progress PR for AMP (automatic mixed precision) support for MXNet, similar to pyTorch version found in https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex.\r\n\r\nThis PR relies on multiple other PRs and bug fixes, listed in Comments section.\r\n\r\nDynamic loss scaling part done by @Caenorst (commits were squashed for easier rebasing).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Auditor that enables/disables operations to be done in FP16 automatically. It is implemented via patching MXNet functions in mxnet.symbol and mxnet.ndarray to insert casts to FP16/FP32 where necessary.\r\n- [x] Operator `amp_cast` and `amp_multicast` that handle casting between FP16/FP32 when necessary and do not change other types. They are optimized to not do anything if the input is already in the proper type.\r\n- [x] Dynamic loss scaling and supporting operators for checking gradients for infs/NaNs and skipping update step if such value is encountered.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This PR relies on multiple other PRs/bug fixes:\r\n  - [x] #14153 \r\n  - [x] https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2572 - once this is done, need to change submodule to point to dmlc/tvm again\r\n  - [x] #14097 \r\n  - [x] https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/issues/503\r\n  - [x] #12139 which was masked by #12189, but which prevents updating to newer dmlc-core\r\n  - [x] #14209 (without this fix SSD from GluonCV does not work)\r\n  - [x] #14325 \r\n  - [x] #14326\r\n  - [x] #14377\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @eric-haibin-lin @szha

Description ##\r\nThe current install instructions for Raspberry Pi did not work for me. I kept at it until I got it working and now I've updated the instructions based on my experience using the cross-compile approach. The wheel I provide is from using this route.\r\n\r\nI think that the dependencies could be leaner, but I know that these worked.\r\n \r\nI did not test the native approach. I made one edit there because I noticed it doesn't install python-dev and that's needed for the Pi wine detector example.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-14T23:11:33Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T15:08:40Z","closed_at":"2019-02-19T15:08:40Z","merged_at":"2019-02-19T15:08:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"af9e3b3ae9f55b51dd2557a8b664622571ceda48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":286739971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODY3Mzk5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Installation","name":"Installation","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":708199304,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxOTkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Website","name":"Website","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":820944660,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA5NDQ2NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Edge%20devices","name":"Edge

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n- The analog of `numpy.allclose(a, b, rtol=1e-05, atol=1e-08, equal_nan=False)` is implemented as a MxNet operator:\r\n```\r\n    mx.nd.contrib.allclose(a, b, rtol, atol, equal_nan)\r\n```\r\n- For now, besides the unit test `test_allclose_function()`, this method is used only in\r\n```\r\ndef assert_almost_equal(a, b, rtol=None, atol=None, names=('a', 'b'), equal_nan=False)\r\n```\r\nwhere parameter **a** or/and **b** could be defined also as  `mx.nd.array`(s):\r\n```\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    a : np.ndarray or mx.nd.array\r\n    b : np.ndarray or mx.nd.array\r\n```\r\n- When calling `assert_almost_equal`, no more `asnumpy()` conversion needed. It will be done automatically (in `assert_almost_equal`), if \r\n     (a) **a** or **b** has no attribute \"context\" OR \r\n     (b) these attributes are different.\r\n\r\n- The elimination of `asnumpy()` conversions and the use of `mx.nd.contrib.allclose(...)` for `mx.nd.array`'s allows to achieve 5-7x speedup for GPU tests that use long arrays.\r\n\r\n- The MxNet operator `mx.nd.contrib.approx_gradient(...)`, for calculation of **one** OR **all** coordinates of the numerical approximation of the gradient vector was implemented. This operator is called in the `numeric_grad(...)`, which is called by widely used `check_numeric_gradient(...)`\r\n \r\n- New parameter  `use_batch` which was added to\r\n```\r\n    def check_numeric_gradient(... use_batch=False):\r\n```\r\nallows to calculate the approximation of gradient in a _batch mode_. \r\n- Unfortunately our current implementation of _batch mode_ **DOES NOT** allow to use it for all operations. For instance, it is impossible to use it   \r\n    (a) for operation, which are similar to matrix multiplications;  \r\n    (b) when the shape of the output of the operation is NOT the same as the shapes of its input parameters;   \r\n    (c) some other cases;   \r\n\r\nCurrently we are using the _batch mode_ **only** when we call\r\n```\r\ndef test_elemwise_binary_ops():\r\n        . . .\r\n        if skip_gradient_check is not True:\r\n            check_numeric_gradient(test, location,\r\n                                   grad_stype_dict=grad_stypes, use_batch=True)\r\n```\r\n- For _elemwise_ operations the _batch mode_ used in `check_numeric_gradient(...)` gives significant (3.5-5x on CPU and 6-10x on GPU) speedup. \r\n\r\n- Even when we cannot use  _batch mode_, we still see the run time improvement associated with the usage of new MxNet operators:\r\n```\r\n     mx.nd.contrib.approx_gradient(...)\r\n     mx.nd.contrib.allclose(...)\r\n```\r\nThere are two causes of this improvement:\r\n    (a) now the number of `asnumpy()` conversions, used inside `check_numeric_gradient(...)`, is significantly less than before;\r\n    (b) more calculations which are made on GPUs.  \r\n\r\n- In general, we see 1.58x improvement in runtime for the test suite `L0_self_test`:\r\n```\r\nNow:      Ran 520 tests in  994.935s\r\nBefore:   Ran 520 tests in 1574.341s \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPerhaps, it makes sense:\r\n- to make possible to use (OR just start to use)  _batch mode_ for other operations;\r\n- eliminate `asnumpy()` conversions used when `assert_almost_equal` function is called.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's not an easy task, because `assert_almost_equal` is used in many different places. But, it should make the Python code cleaner and some tests will run much faster, especially, those, where both parameters **a** and **b** are the  `mx.nd.array`'s\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-14T01:23:40Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T22:02:32Z","closed_at":"2019-03-15T22:02:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15f2e8686affb41c5095744c170549e25a2431a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes shape inference, which currently results in wrong result for some cases.\r\n\r\nAn example problematic case (as it works in current version of MXNet, before applying this change):\r\nIf I do\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data', shape=(1,0,512,512))\r\nweight = mx.sym.Variable('weight')\r\ncdata = mx.sym.cast(data, dtype='float16')\r\ncweight = mx.sym.cast(weight, dtype='float16')\r\ntest = mx.sym.Convolution(data=cdata, weight=cweight,layout='NCHW', pad=(3, 3), num_filter=64, stride=(2, 2), no_bias=True, dilate=(1, 1), kernel=(7, 7), num_group=1)\r\n\r\nprint(test.infer_shape_partial())\r\n```\r\nI get expected result:\r\n```\r\n([(1, 0, 512, 512), (64, 0, 7, 7)], [(1, 64, 256, 256)], [])\r\n```\r\nbut when I change H and W dimensions in the shape to 0s,\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.Variable('data', shape=(1,0,0,0))\r\nweight = mx.sym.Variable('weight')\r\ncdata = mx.sym.cast(data, dtype='float16')\r\ncweight = mx.sym.cast(weight, dtype='float16')\r\ntest = mx.sym.Convolution(data=cdata, weight=cweight,layout='NCHW', pad=(3, 3), num_filter=64, stride=(2, 2), no_bias=True, dilate=(1, 1), kernel=(7, 7), num_group=1)\r\n\r\nprint(test.infer_shape_partial())\r\n```\r\nI get\r\n```\r\n([(1, 0, 0, 0), ()], [(1, 64, 0, 0)], [])\r\n```\r\nso the shape of the weight changed to `()`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Change to the way passes are done so that both forward and backward inference is performed every time - I'm not sure if this is necessary - @eric-haibin-lin, thoughts? \r\n- [x] Change to the way shape inference works. Currently a shape contributes 1 to the `num_unknown` if it has at least 1 zero. After the change number of 0 elements is added to the `num_unknown` - that way shape inference pass does not end prematurely if only some of the elements of shape were deduced.\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nCPP GPU test running too long.  The examples in ci_test.sh are taking longer time to finish. Reduced the number of epochs for which examples were running. Updated mlp example to accept the number of epochs to run. By default the example was running for 15000 epochs.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nDisables flaky test\r\nRelates to #10973\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nDisables test_operator_gpu.test_deconvolution test\r\n\r\n## Comments

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nFixes nightly job by filtering some commands when running the installation guide test.\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\nThis commit was cherry-picked

Description ##\r\nThe nightly job was failing because the installation instructions test was testing v1.3.x instructions against the `master` branch. I've updated the underlying script to filter out the git calls from the set of operations it extracts from the instruction document.\r\nTargets #13800\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nFixes nightly job by filtering some commands when running the installation guide test.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis commit was cherry-picked to be merged to branch `v1.3.x` on PR #14145

title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T23:15:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-11T22:28:52Z","closed_at":"2019-02-13T03:18:13Z","merged_at":"2019-02-13T03:18:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"87c7addcdd520103e68345768e31ffaffbf66399","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

PR adds a new option pin_device_id to Gluon DataLoader. The pin_device_id will be used to allocate pinned memory if pin_memory is True. This option is needed if we want to use pinned memory in DataLoader for distributed training with MXNet and Horovod. Otherwise, multiple training processes will allocate memory on a single device and then cause out of memory error. The default value for pin_device_id is 0 which is the same with the current behavior.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T21:32:28Z","updated_at":"2019-02-13T21:56:49Z","closed_at":"2019-02-13T21:36:29Z","merged_at":"2019-02-13T21:36:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b1761ff118e4724a9d934aa018de90acadda17f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708228884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgyMjg4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Gluon","name":"Gluon","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis is a followup on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14119\r\nfixes #14026 \r\n\r\nIn addition of increase shared memory on docker, I reduced the number of workers. It was using 32 workers and created too large shared memory.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help from the Berlin team, I just attended the office hours and  was able to reproduce the docker environment and test the fix.\r\nThis fix is tested and passed on CI docker using AWS Ubuntu DeepLearning Base AMI on g3.8xlarge\r\nrunning following test passed:\r\n```\r\nci/build.py --docker-registry mxnetci

Description ##\r\nThis PR added MKL-DNN based quantized FullyConnected operator via FComputeEx API, and changed MKL IGEMM based quantized FullyConnected operator to FCompute API.\r\nThe PR also added the subgraph implementation for both FullyConnected and quantized FullyConnected to provide more operator fusion on graph level (it's easier to extend other element-wise operator fusion in the future), the following patterns are supported currently: `FullyConnected + relu`, `quantized FullyConnected + requantize`, and `quantized FullyConnected + requantize + dequantize`.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ZhennanQin @zheng-da \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T08:33:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T02:26:01Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T04:35:04Z","merged_at":"2019-03-08T04:35:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"8668db79ad6e0f75cc848923e323f6c316e18937","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nCurrently we cannot build mxnet on ubuntu 16.04 with USE_LIBJPEG_TURBO=1 because the library was compiled without PIC in the libturbo-jpeg library. Another package libjpegturbo fixes this issue.\r\nsee [this](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/issues/147).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAdds libjpeg-turbo dependency to ubuntu based builds appropriately. \r\nAdds libjpeg-turbo flag to ubuntu builds. This is inline with the build flags used in the shipped version of mxnet, for instance,  see [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/make/pip/pip_linux_cpu.mk#L83).\r\n\r\nNow the CI and CD will be slightly more congruent.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T07:24:56Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T23:58:50Z","closed_at":"2019-02-14T23:58:50Z","merged_at":"2019-02-14T23:58:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf46ca459875bd2a3844fe8ec6bc68b744e7f141","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T05:47:06Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T07:01:12Z","closed_at":"2019-03-04T21:50:28Z","merged_at":"2019-03-04T21:50:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"df7771b4d29f6283f9d7d9d721378fc6be5cf9d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25470168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev","html_url":"https://github.com/sergeykolychev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergeykolychev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14026\r\nTemporary disable gluon tutorial test, as it's failing the nightly test https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14026\r\n\r\nSince this only happens on CI docker envrioment, and I was not able to reproduce the test failure, I am disable this test.  Although I have  a potential fix here https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14119, it can't be properly tested on CI for now.\r\n\r\n**Note: do not merge https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14119 if this PR is merged.**\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR

Description ##\r\nThis is a potential fix for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14026\r\nneed to be tested on CI docker environment before merge.\r\n\r\nSuggest to disable the test first https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14120\r\n\r\naccording to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11872\r\nGluon data loader will hang and give connection refused error if shared memory is too small. Our nightly test on tutorials give 500m shared memory on docker now. Increasing it to 1500m.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

@zheng-da @apeforest @szha  @pengzhao-intel\r\nPR Major change:\r\n\r\n* Introduce `SubgraphSelectorV2` that accepts `BiDirectedNode` instead of `nnvm::Node` to get full context of visited node. `BiDirectedNode` is double linked version of  `nnvm::Node`, which can list the output consumer of node. This is very useful to help make selection which has output requirement. Wrapper class `SubgraphSelectorV2Bridge` is added to convert `SubgraphSelector` to `SubgraphSelectorV2`, which allows developer to continue using old `SubgraphSelector`. So this feature is fully back-compatible.\r\n\r\n* Introduce `kAdjust` mode for `SubgraphProperty` to allow adjusting network parameters instead of create new node. New API `AdjustSubgraphNode()` is added to  `SubgraphProperty` for this, which can adjust selected nodes attributes. This is useful when we don't want to create new subgraph node, but to do some modification on selected nodes. Quantized scale alignment optimization is pending on this feature.\r\n\r\n* Change the behavior of PartitionGraph to create single subgraph node for nodes isolating with each other. https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Enable+Operator+Level+Parallelism+under+Subgraph is depending on this change.\r\n\r\n* Add new subgraph pass \"quantized scale alignment optimization\" as an example for new subgraph API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes nd.slice for erroneous output in the following cases:\r\n(1) begin=end ( fixes #13760 ). Throws invalid input error.\r\n(2) end=-1, step=-1 ( fixes #14105 ). Added tests for the same.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fixed nd.slice for erroneous outputs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-09T20:59:20Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T19:03:14Z","closed_at":"2019-03-12T18:40:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba0e2ae48368cf912c1ce29b54997e4dade07109","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nEarlier, we were using Kernel Launch/Map way of launching kernel to write common CPU and GPU code for ToTensor operator. However, I observed there are too many threads and blocks being launched with kernel causing significant performance implication.\r\n\r\nTo overcome, I wrote a separate CUDA kernel for GPU and moved out of Kernel launch/map.\r\nBenchmarks below.\r\n\r\n**Benchmarks**\r\n\r\nRan 1000 ToTensor operation on (512, 512, 3)\r\n\r\n**GPU**\r\nBefore \r\n\r\n('Average time per ToTensor 512,512,3 - ',

Description ##\r\nCurrently the type of the second argument in `slice_like` op (`shape_from` ) needs to be the same as the first argument, even though only its (second argument's) shape is used. This PR relaxes that so `slice_like` accepts any type for the `shape_from` argument.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x]

Description ##\r\n\r\nReduce copying of shared_ptr. In a microbenchmark is 10% faster. But the main motivation is simplifying creation of nnvm graph on operators.\r\n\r\n    Optimize move semantics of NodeEntry\r\n    https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/pull/2576\r\n    Making copies of shared_ptr is more expensive than moving.\r\n    This PR reduces lock contention by using move semantics in NNVM nodes\r\n    making also more convenient to construct NodeEntry classes in the code\r\n    due to the added ctors.\r\n    \r\n    Update NDarray with NodeEntry constructors and refine initializer lists.\r\n    \r\n    Sync gradient.cc with tvm\r\n\r\nimperative.cc will be addressed in a different refactor.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-08T12:57:57Z","updated_at":"2019-05-25T01:58:04Z","closed_at":"2019-05-23T03:08:27Z","merged_at":"2019-05-23T03:08:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"038b9fbffab88f456b7e72857945142b045b3759","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admi

Description ##\r\nThis adds coverage to the Scala and Java APIs using the scoverage tool. It also updates the scala compiler to a newer maven plugin and adds ResourceScope to prevent memory leaks on a number of integration tests.\r\n\r\nThe coverage can be run with `mvn -B package scoverage:integration-test -Dscoverage.skip=false`.\r\n\r\nAfter that command, a patchy report can be build using `mvn pre-site scoverage:package scoverage:report-only

The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with

Description ##\r\nIncrease the performance of `BulkAppend` and `BulkFlush` methods used in Gluon hybridized models with `static_alloc=True, static_shape=False`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] The previous way of bulking ops in Gluon was creating a new lambda during every BulkAppend function in kind of recursive scheme, which involved copying all the environment every time. This PR changes that by instead introducing a vector of lambda functions to the `BulkStatus` and populating that vector.\r\n- [x] That change improves the time to perform `BulkAppend`, but `BulkFlush` still needed to perform the copy of the entire vector of lambdas, including all of the environment. This is alleviated by, instead of passing the vector by value, a `shared_ptr` is passed instead, increasing the performance of `BulkFlush` function by ~3.5x from 70us to ~20us.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Those changes have the biggest impact in multi-GPU or small model scenario when the speed of scheduling work is the most important (in multi-GPU all work is scheduled by a single Python thread).\r\n- The speed of multiGPU launches should be improved further by going to multiprocess model where each process handles a single GPU.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin \r\n","created_at":"2019-02-05T00:00:34Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T22:02:33Z","closed_at":"2019-02-06T22:02:33Z","merged_at":"2019-02-06T22:02:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"149d8105ea3c4dfd63c3c7e25b3be1e4c4f2ec45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707546925,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NDY5MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\n1. In PR #13802 we added additional support for normalize operator and also re-organized with kernel launch/map functionality.\r\n2. However, PR #13802 introduced performance regression.\r\n3. In this PR, I fix the performance issue and bring it close to the original performance.\r\n4. Earlier, I was parallelizing kernel launch based on length (h*w) and hence, there was a significant overhead compared to simple operation being performance in the kernel (x-mean/std)\r\n5. Main changes in this PR includes - Parallelizing kernel launch based on number of channels rather than length, using omp parallel in the kernel. \r\n\r\n## Before regressing PR #13802 \r\nTotal time

change:\r\nTotal time for 50000 images of shape (3,300,300) to do normalization - 104.09s\r\n\r\nI am working on the fix.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nThis PR modify TensorRT usage by relying on the Subgraph API, the backend is named 'TensorRT'\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- Need an update in documentation for general use cases\r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- TensorRT now just rely on the Subgraph API, and a contrib function for loading weights\r\n- Add FP16 support, computation in FP16 forced by default\r\n- Graph partitioning have changed so if the same input of a subgraph is used multiple times in the subgraph then it stay as a single node in the subgraph\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Now that it's using the Subgraph API, you can use TensorRT with both module API and symbolic API\r\n- The way weights are loaded in the TensorRT node is a little bit dirty, we will do a follow up PR (including one on NNVM) to natively have a node attributes own subgraph parameters including a setter on the c api\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-31T22:54:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-07T19:01:56Z","closed_at":"2019-05-01T16:36:46Z","merged_at":"2019-05-01T16:36:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c874cfc807cee755c38f6486e8e0f4d94416cd8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nCurrently, the label's data descriptor in NDArrayIter.scala does not allow one to specify the dType for the labels passed. It is hardcoded at MX_REAL_TYPE. This PR addresses that.\r\nFixes #14037 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n@lanking520 @andrewfayres @zachgk

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\ntransposed convolution operator in CPU w/o MKLDNN is not working properly when dilation is set. This is because the mshadow library function `unpack_patch2col` and `pack_col2patch` generate incorrect results with dilation parameter.

Description ##\r\n\r\nEases the pain of linking with OpenBLAS using cmake.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to use the provided `OpenBLASConfig.cmake`.\r\n\r\n### Justification for the change\r\n\r\nThe standard way of linking with dependencies in CMake is via the `find_package()` mechanism ([docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)). This mechanism provides 2 ways of finding the dependencies:\r\n- Config mode (uses a file named `OpenBLASConfig.cmake` (or `openblas-config.cmake`), which are provided by the dependency itself)\r\n- Module mode (uses a file named `FindOpenBLAS.cmake`, which is provided by either cmake or the project compiling the dependency, mxnet in this case)\r\n\r\nThe preferred way to find a dependency is if they provide their \"Config\" file, since the authors of the dependency are the ones who know best about the structure of their code and how they should be linked.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to compile MXNet on Windows it didn't work well. My setup was:\r\n\r\n- Visual studio 2017.\r\n- OpenBLAS package from the SourceForge binaries package, as specified in the [documentation to build MXNet on Windows from source](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/install/windows_setup.html#build-from-source).\r\n\r\nIt failed because this binary package is compiled with a Visual Studio version prior to 2015. So I would get the error `unresolved external symbol __imp____iob_func`. The reasons are explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30412951/unresolved-external-symbol-imp-fprintf-and-imp-iob-func-sdl2\r\n\r\nThen I tried to use the [conda-forge package](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openblas). This almost worked.\r\n\r\nOn further inspection of the [FindOpenBLAS.cmake](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cmake/Modules/FindOpenBLAS.cmake) and the conda-forge package, I noticed that MXNet didn't use the provided \"cmake Config mode\" files (`OpenBLASConfig.cmake`). It tried to find the library all by itself, which is an \"anti-pattern\" when using cmake. So I thought that this could be an opportunity to be able to contribute to the project by improving this module.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add , tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\nI have tested this by compiling it on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\nTo provide OpenBLAS I have tried:\r\n\r\nOn Linux:\r\n- compiled OpenBLAS from source with cmake and installed it\r\n- compiled OpenBLAS from source with make and installed it\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n- used the compiled OpenBLAS package from conda-forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openblas\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThis PR aims to fix #12203 . The test_depthwise convolution fails occasionally on CI for GPU context. The problem occurs as the test tries to match **GPU** output of convolution on an image with **CPU** output of convolution on sliced images concatenated later. The error tolerance values are sometimes exceeded. When the comparison instead is made between **GPU** output of convolution on an image with **GPU** output of convolution on sliced images concatenated later, it passes the test.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Second context changed to match first one. This make comparison for different implementations on same contexts\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-29T01:55:45Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T10:47:03Z","closed_at":"2019-02-05T19:04:44Z","merged_at":"2019-02-05T19:04:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"41ba0142a37ed8b8d7432993d6becd6ad73d316b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR removes the debug flag during build, adds support for v1.4.x docs, and fixes a publish bug (that I introduced).\r\n\r\nRegarding the bug, I needed to add an artifacts flag to `settings.ini` so that I could skip trying to copy artifacts from branches where they don't exist. I could have put this logic in post processing in `update_all_version.sh`, but I liked the fact that the artifact step happens with the rest of the docs generation, so you get in with a local single version build and with a full multi-version site build.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nAnyone testing this might run into an error with the java/scala docs generation step. Something seems to have caused locally cached build files to break the docs generation (unrelated to this PR), so delete your `build_version_doc/apache_mxnet` folder and try again.

items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nUpdate maven build script for mac based on @azai91 build instruction\r\n\r\nThe problem in here: Mac used a clang with old OpenMP version which may causing the problems with the build. The best way to deal with this without introducing a LLVM dependencies is to upgrade your xcode version (Xcode 9.2 or above)\r\n\r\n@szha @marcoabreu @zachgk \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be
