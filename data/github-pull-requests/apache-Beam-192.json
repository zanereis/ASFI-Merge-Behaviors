is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented here: https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3.\r\n\r\nSince the io package is quite big, with a large amount of open issues, I've decided to split up the porting of this package into multiple PRs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ports the `io.source_test_utils.py` and `io.sources_test` modules and adds the already passing `io.concat_source_test.py `module to the Python 3 test suite.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK |

[streamy-db](https://github.com/domsj/streamy-db), although I've worked around this issue by defining [my own timestampPolicyFactory](https://github.com/domsj/streamy-db/blob/594b8db1a1008f8c46a5483ea9284cb2ea714dbb/src/main/scala/domsj/streamy/db/beam/package.scala#L20-L46)).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best road is towards making this contribution, how much discussion it would need, and via which channel. So I'm just opening this preliminary PR and hoping you will enlighten me about the proper way forward :-)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

resolves the work for [BEAM-3612] to make it easy to generate type assertion shims, in particular with the starcgen tool. With this nothing in the main beam core generates unnecessary reflection overhead. We are likely able to delete the .../exec/optimized package as well, which added unnecessary bloat to binaries with questionable gain.\r\n\r\nThis PR is large, but most of the bulk is in the generated code, which is in any *.shims.go file. \r\nThe rest is adding go:generate lines to invoke the starcgen tool to generate the registrations and shims.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the starcgen tool make it more convenient to use within a package, and also possible to write out diagnostic output to the generated file.\r\nThe change to the shimx package (which does the actual code generation) makes the closured method wrappings for StructuralDoFns stably sorted to avoid unnecessary re-ordering on subsequent generations. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented here: https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3.\r\n\r\nSince the io package is quite big, with a large amount of open issues, I've decided to split up the porting of this package into multiple PRs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ports the `io.rangetrackers.py` module and adds the already passing `io.restriction_trackers.py` module to the Python 3 test suite.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

avoids tiny allocations on encode and decode of all the ints,varints, and window headers necessary for Beam Go to function over the FnAPI.\r\n\r\nGo's escape analysis is pretty good, except when it comes to indirect function calls and interfaces. If an argument is passed through to one of those, the compiler has no choice but to allocate it to the heap, as the lifetime can't be known without additional analysis.\r\n\r\nUsing the unsafe package, it's possible to wrap invocations of interfaces like io.Reader and io.Writer, and encourage the compiler to allocate the small buffers to the stack instead. This reduces garbage generation, which saves CPU time in the garbage collector.\r\n\r\nGo's tooling permits reading the escape analysis results and justification for why something was moved to the heap or not. For example, before I changed the coder/int.go this was the analysis output for the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/code/src/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/graph/coder\r\n % go build -gcflags '-m -m -l' 2>&1 | grep /int.go\r\n./int.go:27:13: make([]byte, 8) escapes to heap\r\n./int.go:27:13:         from ret (assigned) at ./int.go:27:6\r\n./int.go:27:13:         from w.Write(ret) (parameter to indirect call) at ./int.go:29:19\r\n./int.go:26:33: leaking param: w\r\n./int.go:26:33:         from w.Write(ret) (receiver in indirect call) at ./int.go:29:19\r\n./int.go:34:19: leaking param: r\r\n./int.go:34:19:         from r (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:35:28\r\n./int.go:44:13: make([]byte, 4) escapes to heap\r\n./int.go:44:13:         from ret (assigned) at ./int.go:44:6\r\n./int.go:44:13:         from w.Write(ret) (parameter to indirect call) at ./int.go:46:19\r\n./int.go:43:33: leaking param: w\r\n./int.go:43:33:         from w.Write(ret) (receiver in indirect call) at ./int.go:46:19\r\n./int.go:51:19: leaking param: r\r\n./int.go:51:19:         from r (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:52:28\r\n./int.go:60:31: leaking param: w\r\n./int.go:60:31:         from w (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:61:21\r\n./int.go:65:18: leaking param: r\r\n./int.go:65:18:         from r (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:66:26\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that  all the make []bytes are escaping.\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/code/src/github.com/apache/beam/sdks/go/pkg/beam/core/graph/coder\r\n % go build -gcflags '-m -m -l' 2>&1 | grep /int.go\r\n./int.go:26:33: leaking param: w\r\n./int.go:26:33:         from w (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:29:31\r\n./int.go:28:33: EncodeUint64 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:29:39: EncodeUint64 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:34:19: leaking param: r\r\n./int.go:34:19:         from r (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:36:34\r\n./int.go:36:42: DecodeUint64 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:39:37: DecodeUint64 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:43:33: leaking param: w\r\n./int.go:43:33:         from w (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:46:31\r\n./int.go:45:33: EncodeUint32 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:46:39: EncodeUint32 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:51:19: leaking param: r\r\n./int.go:51:19:         from r (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:53:34\r\n./int.go:53:42: DecodeUint32 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:56:37: DecodeUint32 data does not escape\r\n./int.go:60:31: leaking param: w\r\n./int.go:60:31:         from w (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:61:21\r\n./int.go:65:18: leaking param: r\r\n./int.go:65:18:         from r (passed to call[argument escapes]) at ./int.go:66:26\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards, they are not escaping. \r\n\r\nAn alternative of this would be to pass around concrete reader and writers, so escape analysis would function properly, however, this would tie the code too in-depth to the implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

allocations of return slices when invoking DoFns, and cache the type conversion transforms. Largely lives with the invariant that within a DoFn, all inputs will be of the same type, and avoids the overhead of the type switch in Convert on a perDoFn basis.\r\n\r\nThis adds more overhead on the initial call for a DoFn, but saves ~30-50ns per invocation avoiding allocation overhead, and type comparison overhead.\r\n\r\nThe calls closures in fn_arity.go are generated up to funcs with 7 args and 3 returns from the fn_arity.tmpl file. They shouldn't require much change or maintenance. However, there's likely opportunity to benchmark to see where the break even point for the default \"general\" case is, vs the generated code.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

improvements to the schema CoGroup transform:\r\n  * Allow the user to use strings instead of TupleTags. TupleTags existed to make Java type inference work, and this is not needed with the schema-based join as the types are in the schema. This also allows a simpler builder for PCollectionTuple.\r\n\r\n  * Instead of multiple CoGroup.byFieldNames, byFieldIds, etc. the new syntax is CoGroup.join(By.fieldNames), CoGroup.join(By.fieldIds), etc. This shrinks the API surface area, and also provides a place to provide per-input options (used for outer joins).\r\n\r\n* Add a .crossProductJoin. This expands the iterables into an inner-product. For example:\r\n    PCollection<Row> innerJoined = inputs.apply(\r\n        CoGroup.join(\"input1\", By.fieldNames(\"user\"))\r\n                       .join(\"input2\", By.fieldNames(\"user\"))\r\n                       .crossProductJoin();\r\n\r\n* Each input can be marked for \"outer-join\" participation semantics. This means that if no records for that input are present for a join key, an output is still generated from the cross product with the value for that input replaced by a null. This generalizes normal left/right/full outer joins to N inputs. For example with two inputs:\r\n    PCollection<Row> leftOuterJoined = inputs.apply(\r\n        CoGroup.join(\"input1\", By.fieldNames(\"user\").withOuterJoinParticipation())\r\n                       .join(\"input2\", By.fieldNames(\"user\"))\r\n                       .crossProductJoin();\r\nR: @dpmills \r\nR: @akedin

link both the registration invite and the #beam channel invite on the contact\r\npage. Most people clicked on the \"Join\" link which sent them to the #general\r\nchannel after signing up in Slack. They would ask questions there which\r\nbothered some of the ~2000 channel ASF members.\r\n\r\nThis makes it more obvious that users won't land in the #beam channel after\r\nsigning up. It also strategically places the #beam channel link first.\r\n\r\n@iemejia Just saw that you already fixed this. Do you think it makes sense to merge this? It does make it more clear that there are two links involved and one is just for signing up.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented here: https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3.\r\n\r\nSince the io package is quite big, with a large amount of open issues, I've decided to split up the porting of this package into multiple PRs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ports the `io.filesystemio` module and adds the already passing `io.localfilesystem_test` module to the Python 3 test suite.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

current naming scheme for the vendored grpc package relocation uses underscores between the version parts (v1_13_1); this breaks JNI package name parsing, which is used by the default netty SSL provider. When we disabled conscrypt SSL for BEAM-6182, this broke streaming Dataflow pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the naming scheme to use 'p' between identifiers. We also point projects at the project version of vendored grpc rather than the released artifact so that we can test the fix; we should follow-up after releasing a new vendored artifact to point projects at it.\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of #7255, trying to fix build issues.\r\n\r\n/cc @kennknowles @aaltay \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented here: https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3.\r\n\r\nSince the io package is quite big, with a large amount of open issues, I've decided to split up the porting of this package into multiple PRs.\r\n\r\nThis PR ports the io.filesystem module and fixes the hanging tests related to gzip (BEAM-5623), which were blocking further porting of the io package.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex |

the 2.9.0 release, we [realized](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/dc816a5f8c82dd4d19e82666209305ec67d46440fe8edba4534f9b63@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E) that the website could not be built from the source archive because the build assumes a git environment. This change explicitly handles the case of building outside of git.\r\n\r\nI validated this using the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download a zip archive of this branch and unzip in a new directory: https://github.com/swegner/beam/archive/website_git.zip\r\n  a. Copy gradle wrapper files which are [excluded from export](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/d3fbf8059c1282fc12251538121830381dfaff6f/.gitattributes#L32).\r\n1. From the unzipped directory, build and test the website: `./gradlew -p website check stageWebsite --scan`\r\n\r\nThe build [now succeeds](https://gradle.com/s/qjon5mqdxh4n4) and staged website was uploaded to http://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/swegner-archive/index.html\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.
