replaces the old custom hashmap variant in MetaMethodIndex with standard maps. Problem though is that this change is a breaking change. MetaMethodIndex itself looks very different now, but is not likely used. There is one protected method in MetaClassImpl which is also used for example by ExpandoMetaClass, which I consider slightly more as problem.

special attention should be given to the change of ClassNodeResolver. So far whenever Groovy tried to compile on a newer JDK it did fail because it could not read the class file version. This is mostly due to the decompiler (using ASM to read class files).  https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/60bde29d2d6546d0cf2c4f83a5f2ad9c641710e6/src/main/java/org/codehaus/groovy/control/ClassNodeResolver.java#L260\r\nThis would normally throw a IllegalArgumentException, which is by this change now swallowed and Groovy falls back to ClassLoader based reading of the file instead. This is of course slower then, but it will still work.","created_at":"2023-12-21T12:35:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-16T16:04:19Z","closed_at":"2024-01-09T16:46:27Z","merged_at":"2024-01-09T16:46:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"1034c3ad13bc2b00b6684ff21c0d78d57eee9f62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-milles","id":18193802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18193802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-milles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-milles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/2019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/2019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/2019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/cef341d45c8a8ca2591f7b310bddf6d5f33689d0","head":{"label":"apache:feature/update_jvm_version_handling","ref":"feature/update_jvm_version_handling","sha":"cef341d45c8a8ca2591f7b310bddf6d5f33689d0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

This plugin is now built to Java 11 class file format. It requires Gradle to run on Java 11 or later. (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/1c1955efc33a80498d5c8f31937bd8f6a090a5a9\">1c1955e</a>)\nb. Enable Java Tool Chain support by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/c94b8865d844064f4900d156192c0ea448277854\">c94b886</a>). To disable it, set <code>useJavaToolchains = false</code> in the <code>spotbugs</code> extension.\nc. Drop support for Gradle 7.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/4b0f8006fdfe6345a74edb356e3c3b1da13225f1\">4b0f800</a>). The convention API provides replacement from 7.1 and later, so we use 7.1 as minimal required version.\nd. Remove deprecated methods <code>SpotBugsTask.getEnabledReports()</code> and <code>SpotBugsTask.getFirstEnabledReport</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/2ab3c45bf6215ba1f35e87427893d4c97a7190bc\">2ab3c45</a>)\ne. The <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code> now accept enum values instead of String instances. Read the following notes for detail.</p>\n<h3>Note for Groovy buildscripts</h3>\n<p>Groovy buildscripts should use use <code>valueOf(String)</code> method explicitly for <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code>. For example:</p>\n<pre lang=\"groovy\"><code>// before (v5)\nspotbugs {\n    effort = 'default'\n    reportLevel = 'default'\n}\n<p>// after (v6)\nspotbugs {\neffort = Effort.valueOf('DEFAULT')\nreportLevel = Confidence.valueOf('DEFAULT')\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This limitation is caused by a <a href=\"https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/bug-cannot-use-kotlin-enum-from-groovy/1521\">known issue of the Groovy language</a>.</p>\n<h3>Note for Kotlin buildscripts</h3>\n<p>It is recommended to use Gradle 8.2 or later, then you can enjoy the <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/8.2/release-notes.html#simple-property-assignment-in-kotlin-dsl-enabled-by-default\">simple property assignment</a> feature by default.</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>// legacy (Gradle 8.1 and older)\nimport com.github.spotbugs.snom.Confidence\nimport com.github.spotbugs.snom.Effort\n<p>spotbugs {\neffort.set(Effort.DEFAULT)\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Analysis\r\nAs mentioned by Paul's comment in the jira, this is a bug in `JsonParserCharArray`. The problem does not exist in `JsonParserUsingCharacterSource`.\r\nAfter debugging through both classes, both parser methods look exactly the same, except that `CharacterSource` would automatically add a `10`(line feed) char at the end, which triggers an exception. But for `JsonParserCharArray` it ends right at the last curly brace so the exception is overlooked.\r\n# Fix\r\nTo keep the behavior consistent across `JsonParserCharArray` and `JsonParserUsingCharacterSource`, a line feed character is added to the end of the char array on initialization of `JsonParserCharArray`.\r\n#

Bug Description\r\nSomething like\r\n```\r\n            interface A<K, V> {\r\n            }\r\n            class B<V> implements A<Long, V>{\r\n            }\r\n            A<Long, String> a = new B<>()\r\n```\r\nwould cause groovyc to fail.\r\n\r\n# Analysis\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-11192\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in `org.codehaus.groovy.transform.stc.StaticTypeCheckingVisitor#inferDiamondType`.\r\n\r\nThe `inferredType` is `java.util.Map<java.lang.Long, java.lang.String> -> java.util.Map<K, V> `and `cceType` is `MapLong<> -> MapLong<V>`.\r\n\r\nAfter `adjustGenerics()` on line 1124, `cceType` becomes `MapLong<java.lang.Long, java.lang.String> -> MapLong<V>`, which is incorrect. It should be `MapLong<java.lang.String> -> MapLong<V>`.\r\n\r\n# Fix\r\nIf we see (# of generic types for A) > (# of generic types for B's redirect), then only keep the generic types that correspond to B's redirect generic types.\r\n\r\nA.genericTypes = [Long, String]\r\nB.genericTypes = []\r\nA.redirect().genericTypes = [K, V]\r\nB.redirect().genericTypes = [V]\r\n\r\nIn this case, find the index of `V` in A.redirect().genericTypes, then find the corresponding type in A.genericTypes, which is
