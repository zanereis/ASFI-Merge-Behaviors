#34482 \r\n\r\nkubelet client will not remove pods for us. After discussions, it is discovered that all containers inside a Pod will be able to respond to a SIGTERM signal. So instead of going into the istio-proxy container and use the `/quitquitquit` endpoint to pause the sidecar, we can just use the api `delete_namespaced_pod` to delete the entire pod.\r\n\r\nThis PR

This function allows users to return a list of distinct values from a MongoDB collection. I think the distinct function fits well with the other collection functions in the hook.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```py\r\nhook = MongoHook(conn_id='my_conn_id')\r\ncoll = hook.get_collection(\r\n                mongo_db='test',\r\n                mongo_collection='test',\r\n            )\r\ndistinct_keys = coll.distinct('name')\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```py\r\nhook = MongoHook(conn_id='my_conn_id')\r\ndistinct_keys= hook.get_collection(\r\n                mongo_db='test',\r\n                mongo_collection='test',\r\n                key='name'\r\n

#34388\r\nrelated: #21605\r\n\r\nThis PR combines the multi-line log messages read from KubernetesPodOperator pod before logging them by the task.\r\n\r\nWhy removing the logged error messages is not enough?\r\n\r\nIn case of any interruption, we retry the method, so if we are in the middle of a multi-line message, we could have a duplication in the log because all the lines after the first one do not have a timestamp, but by combining them in the same message before logging them, we ensure in case of any interruption that we will retry combining and logging the whole message because we didn't do that in the first

tasks with the trigger rule `all_skipped` end up in `no status` state if they have an upstream task that is in `upstream_failed`

{dagrun.py:674} ERROR - Task deadlock (no runnable tasks); marking run <DagRun all_skipped_example_2 @ 2023-09-15 12:35:59.760313+00:00: manual__2023-09-15T12:35:59.760313+00:00, state:running, queued_at: 2023-09-15 12:35:59.767117+00:00. externally triggered: True> failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seemed not right so I attempted to fix it by adding `upstream` failed as a condition to mark tasks with the `all_skipped` trigger rule as skipped.\r\n\r\nAfter the fix this is the behavior of the same DAG.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/90063506/5201c910-dd48-46ce-8b82-4b4a95aac6ea)\r\n\r\nThis behavior would be the same as for `all_failed` where an upstream task in `success` or `skipped` state leads to the task to be skipped. But I think maybe there is an argument for having the task with the `all_skipped` trigger rule fail instead of being skipped if an upstream task is in `upstream_failed` to preserve the final DAG state if the `all_skipped` task is the only leaf? The current error leads to a DAG run failure, while skipping the final task marks it as successful.\r\n\r\nDAG to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom pendulum import datetime\r\n\r\n@dag(\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 8, 1),\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n)\r\ndef all_skipped_example_2():\r\n    @task\r\n    def

all_skipped_task_1():\r\n        return \"hi\"\r\n\r\n    @task\r\n    def downstream_task():\r\n        return \"hi\"\r\n\r\n    upstream_task_1_obj = upstream_task_1()\r\n\r\n    (upstream_task_1_obj >> all_skipped_task_1() >> downstream_task())\r\n\r\n    upstream_task_0() >> upstream_task_1_obj\r\n\r\n\r\nall_skipped_example_2()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also attempted to add a

Overview\r\n\r\nIntroducing the **AWS ECS executor**!\r\n\r\nOver the past couple months myself, @ferruzzi  and @syedahsn have been hard at work on an AWS ECS executor (if you've not seen us as much in the community, this is why :sweat_smile:), based on an initial contribution from @aelzeiny\r\n\r\nFrom the headline sentence in the README:\r\n> This is an Airflow executor powered by Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). Each task that Airflow schedules for execution is run within its own ECS container.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial release with most of the basic functionality in place. We have many future upgrades, CLI commands, and other features planned, so stay tuned!\r\n\r\n# Review Notes\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a large PR, which in some ways is not ideal. However, it can be difficult to release portions of a component like this. We've tried to scope all the code here to the minimum required for folks to begin using this executor.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing, I don't think it's required to read every single line of code. I have annotated most modules in the diff view with comments explaining the changes. Please take a look at the portions you think are relevant or that you have some experience in.\r\n\r\nUltimately, (almost) all the code is scoped to the Amazon provider package and it is a net new component, so there is a very limited blast radius. Very little existing user workflows or code should be affected. Included in the list below are the areas of existing code that have been updated, which have the possibility of affecting user workflows. \r\n\r\n**Some specific changes to pay particular attention to**:\r\n- The new logging environment variable to enable task logs to work correctly in containerized executors. K8s has an approach for this, which we follow quite closely when making it generic. However, we did not convert K8s to this new mechanism to keep the change set minimal and reduce blast radius.\r\n- Updates to boto user agent tagging in the Base Aws hook.\r\n- A config yaml is now present in the AWS provider, leveraging @potiuk's changes, this is new code, but the first time we're leveraging this system so it's worth reviewing carefully\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nThere is extensive unit testing which has near 100% line coverage in most cases:\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-09-14 11-43-48](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/7fcf9b85-ae54-4ef6-9dd3-c8e537301931)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also performed a lot of manual UAT for things such as:\r\n- Load testing (500 concurrent tasks, reaching the limit imposed by ECS, see the performance and tuning section of the README)\r\n- Different platform versions of ECS Fargate\r\n- Multiple ways to provide AWS credentials to the executor (built into the image, using Airflow connection, etc)\r\n- Deferrable operators\r\n- Dynamic task mapping \r\n- Data Driven Scheduling\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

It has already been addressed in other places using `func.count()`, so the problematic line looks more like a typo/oversight.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^

#32767 has moved all k8s classes to cncf.kubernetes provider, however there was a mistake with location of Pod*Exceptions - rather than in pod_manager they remained defined in the kubernetes_executor package - which has the side-effect that trying to import them in Airflow Pre 2.7 raised the\r\n\"You should not use the provider's executors in this version of Airflow.\" error.\r\n\r\nThis change moves the exceptions to the pod_generator package to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
