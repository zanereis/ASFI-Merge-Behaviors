for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnhance method verifyNotReadPath to identify subqueries hidden in the filter conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSparkSQL will throw exception if outputPath tries to overwrite inputpath. You can see the specific validation method 'verifyNotReadPath()' in the ddl.scala. SparkSQL can identify simple scenario such as:\r\n\r\n`insert overwrite table output_t select * from output_t;`\r\nHowever，SparkSQL cannot identify more complex scenarios where the subquery is hidden within filter conditions, such as：\r\n\r\n```\r\ninsert overwrite table output_t select * from input_t ta where not exists(select tb.id from output_t tb where tb.id = ta.id);\r\ninsert overwrite table output_t select * from input_t ta where ta.id in (select id from output_t );\r\ninsert overwrite table output_t select * from input_t ta where ta.id < (select max(tb.id) from output_t tb where tb.id=ta.id);\r\n```\r\nIn these scenarios above, SparkSQL throws an exception with the message 'java.io.FileNotFoundException: File does not exist' which can be confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The aforementioned SQL will throw a more explicit exception with the message 'Can't overwrite a path that is also being read from'.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nBefore the Change:\r\n\r\nUsers needed to import LOG_SCHEMA to read structured logs as a JSON data source:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.util.LogUtils.LOG_SCHEMA\r\n\r\nval logDf = spark.read.schema(LOG_SCHEMA).json(\"path/to/logs\")\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter the Change:\r\n\r\n- Renamed for Clarity:`LOG_SCHEMA` has been renamed to `SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA` to make its purpose more clear.\r\n- No Import Needed in REPL Shells: You can now use `SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA` directly in REPL environments like spark-shell and pyspark without importing it.\r\n\r\nNow, you can read structured logs without the import:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval logDf = spark.read.schema(SPARK_LOG_SCHEMA).json(\"path/to/logs\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimply the way to query structured logs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this a new feature in Spark 4.0\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the misreporting of fatal errors (such as `OutOfMemoryError`) as uncaught exceptions in `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler`.\r\n\r\n#### Context\r\n\r\nIn `Executor.scala`, an exception is considered fatal if any exception in the chain (or its causes) is fatal. This behavior is controlled by the `spark.executor.killOnFatalError.depth` config, which limits the depth to which the chain is inspected. If a fatal error is found, `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` is called.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` only considers the top-level exception when reporting the exit code, rather than traversing the full exception chain to identify the true fatal cause. As a result, some fatal errors, such as `OutOfMemoryError`, are mistakenly reported as uncaught exceptions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if we have an OOM exception with the following structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRuntimeException\r\n - Caused by: RuntimeException\r\n - Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemory\r\n```\r\n\r\nSparkUncaughtExceptionHandler would quit the executor with error code SparkExitCode.UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION, when the true cause is an OOM error.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler` to:\r\n- Inspect the exception chain (up to the configured depth).\r\n- Ensure that the actual fatal error is correctly identified and reflected in the exit code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a bug because some nonfatal exceptions are mistakenly reported as an uncaught exception when the true cause is some other fatal error down the exception chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added to `SparkUncaughtExceptionHandlerSuite.scala`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR collations can now be identified by their fully qualified name, as per the collation project plan. The `Collation` expression has been changed to always return fully qualified name. Currently we only support predefined collations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake collation names behave as per the project spec.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Two user-facing changes are made:\r\n1. Collation expression now returns fully qualified name:\r\n```sql\r\nselect collation('a' collate utf8_lcase) -- returns `SYSTEM.BUILTIN.UTF8_LCASE`\r\n```\r\n2. Collations can now be identified by their full qualified name:\r\n```sql\r\nselect contains('a' collate system.builtin.utf8_lcase, 'A') -- returns true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to make `StaticInvoke` compatible with the method that return `Any`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, our `StaticInvoke` does not support calling the method with a return type signature of `Any`(actually, the type of return value may be `different data type`), while `Invoke` supports it, let's align it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, only for spark developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake `AbstractStringType` class serializable, so that the derived classes can be used in expressions that perform replacement using `Invoke`-like Spark expressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nObjects with custom parameters cannot be used as inputTypes unless the underlying class is serializable. For example, `ValidateUTF8` is a string function that uses `StaticInvoke` replacement, and an object derived from `AbstractStringType` as one of the input types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests suffice. More will be added with appropriate collation support in various Spark expressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `grpcio` and `grpcio-status` `1.67.0` for Python 3.13 tests in order to reveal the remaining test failures after installing the official `grpcio` in Python 3.13 environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`grpcio` added Python 3.13 support since 1.66.2.\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.67.0/\r\n- https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/1.66.2/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is an infra change for test coverage. Currently, `pyspark-connect` module test fails due to the missing required package, `grpc`, like the following. \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11372942311/job/31638495254\r\n```\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'grpc'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual check the generated image of this PR builder.\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/dongjoon-hyun/apache-spark-ci-image:master-11389776259 python3.13 -m pip list | grep grpcio\r\ngrpcio

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a separate docker file for doc build\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\ncurrently we only have single test image, for `pyspark`, `sparkr`, `lint` and `docs`, it has two major issues:\r\n1, disk space limitation: we are adding more and more packages in it, the disk space left for testing is very limited, and cause `No space left on device` from time to time;\r\n2, environment conflicts: for example, even though we already install some packages for `docs` in the docker file, we still need to install some additional python packages in `build_and_test`, due to the conflicts between `docs` and `pyspark`. It is hard to maintain because the related packages are installed in two different places.\r\n\r\nso I am thinking of spinning off some installations (e.g. `docs`) from the base image, so that:\r\n1, we can completely cache all the dependencies for `docs`;\r\n2, the related installations are centralized;\r\n3, we can free up disk space on the base image (after we spin off other dependency, we can remove unneeded packages from it);\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we want to apply multiple images, we can easily support different environments, e.g. adding a separate image for old versions of `pandas/pyarrow/etc`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno, infra-only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nci\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

The API call\r\nis best effort.\r\n\r\nBy logging the error using the Python warnings module, we produce\r\na user facing warning and can be confusing.\r\nThe original intention is to add it to the log output for debugging when\r\nnecessary. Switch to use a standard logger instead.\r\n\r\nThe warnings module should generally be used to warn users of their\r\nchoices - deprecated API, unapplied option, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to provide default values for metrics on observe API, when physical node (CollectMetricsExec) is lost in executed plan. This includes the case where logical node (CollectMetrics) is lost during optimization (and it's mostly the case).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen user defines the metrics via observe API, they expect the metrics to be retrieved via Observation (batch query) or update event of StreamingQueryListener.\r\n\r\nBut when the node (CollectMetrics) is lost in any reason (e.g. subtree is pruned by PruneFilters), Spark does behave like the metrics were not defined, instead of providing default values.\r\n\r\nWhen the query runs successfully, user wouldn't expect the metric being bound to the query to be unavailable, hence they missed to guard the code for this case and encountered some issue. Arguably it's lot better to provide default values - when the node is pruned out from optimizer, it is mostly logically equivalent that there were no input being processed with the node (except the bug in analyzer/optimizer/etc which drop the node incorrectly), hence it's valid to just have default value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, user can consistently query about metrics being defined with observe API. It is available even with aggressive optimization which drop the CollectMetrics(Exec) node.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-17T09:02:46Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T03:30:01Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T10:44:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b37de118ab521ee1276bbe86ba35cd3b380e811","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAvoid unnecessary operations in `attach_distributed_sequence_column`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, `attach_distributed_sequence_column` always needs `sdf.columns`, which may trigger an analysis task in Spark Connect if the `sdf.schema` has not been cached;\r\n2, for zero columns dataframe, it trigger `sdf.count` which seems redundant;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded ut\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd named argument support to more TVFs.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM inline(input => array(struct(1, 'a'), struct(2, 'b')));\r\nSELECT * FROM inline_outer(input => array(struct(1, 'a'), struct(2, 'b')));\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM posexplode(collection => array(1, 2));\r\nSELECT * FROM posexplode_outer(collection => map('a', 1, 'b',

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following TVFs should support named argument as same as `explode`:\r\n\r\n- `inline`\r\n- `posexplode`\r\n- `variant_explode`\r\n\r\nand their `_outer` variations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the above functions support named arguments.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-16T21:23:32Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T20:45:35Z","closed_at":"2024-11-05T20:45:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94a44ef0b75f21d9dd9e689be11b0bc3d729fb77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8a8a8c0b08e6f94af97149a5f368baf26e25caa","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-49995/named_argument","ref":"issues/SPARK-49995/named_argument","sha":"d8a8a8c0b08e6f94af97149a5f368baf26e25caa","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds `try_parse_url` expression that sets `failOnError` to false by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nINVALID_URL contains suggested fix for turning off ANSI mode. Now that in Spark 4.0.0 we have moved to ANSI mode on by default, we want to keep suggestions of this kind to the minimum. There exist implementations of `try_*` functions which provide safe way to get behavior as for ANSI mode off and suggestions of this kind should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn this case, try expressions

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix a flaky test by handling `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2235`(multiple failures exception) in addition to the single exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter merging\r\n- #47533\r\n\r\nThe following failures were reported multiple times in the PR and today.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11358629880/job/31593568476\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11367718498/job/31621128680\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11360602982/job/31598792247\r\n```\r\n[info] - SPARK-47148: AQE should avoid to submit shuffle job on cancellation *** FAILED *** (6 seconds, 92 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   \"Multiple failures in stage materialization.\" did not contain \"coalesce test error\" (AdaptiveQueryExecSuite.scala:939)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.cleanUpAndThrowException` throws two types of exceptions. When there are multiple errors, `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2235` is thrown. We need to handle this too in the test case.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcfe62b9988f9b00c23de0b71acc1c6170edee9e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala#L843-L850\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcfe62b9988f9b00c23de0b71acc1c6170edee9e/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/errors/QueryExecutionErrors.scala#L1916-L1921\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Also, [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48206/files#diff-0ffd087e0d4e1618761a42c91b8712fd469e758f4789ca2fafdefff753fe81d5) started getting to big, so this is an effort to split the change needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, legacy error is now merged into ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests check that the error message stayed the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn 'HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol', task output files are generated ahead instead of calling `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat#getDefaultWorkFile`, which uses the `mapreduce.output.basename` as the prefix of output files.\r\nIn this pull request, we modify the `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol.getFilename` method to also look up this config instead of using the hardcoded 'part'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nGiven a custom file name is a useful feature for users. They can use it to distinguish files added by different engines, on different days, etc. We can also align the usage scenario with other SQL on Hadoop engines for better Hadoop compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, a Hadoop configuration 'mapreduce.output.basename' can be used in file datasource output files\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- improve `performance` of `randStr`.\r\n- make the `non-codegen` and `codegen` implementations of `randStr` as consistent as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport kde/density plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49530.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. kde/density plots are supported as shown below.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> data = [\r\n...     (1.0, 4.0),\r\n...     (2.0, 4.0),\r\n...     (2.5, 4.5),\r\n...     (3.0, 5.0),\r\n...     (3.5, 5.5),\r\n...     (4.0, 6.0),\r\n...

fig2 = df.plot(kind=\"kde\", column=\"x\", bw_method=0.3, ind=20)\r\n>>> fig2.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- fix the `error prompt` when `seedExpression` is `non-foldable` in `randstr`.\r\n- use `toSQLId` to set the parameter value `inputName` for `randstr ` and `uniform` of `NON_FOLDABLE_INPUT`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Let me take an example\r\n```scala\r\nval df =

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix how the JVM options are supplemented with Java module options and IPv6 options. Get and set based on the exact value of `spark.*.extraJavaOptions`, and don't use the helper config which combines both default and extra Java options.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current approach using `DRIVER_JAVA_OPTIONS` and `EXECUTOR_JAVA_OPTIONS` loads both the `spark.*.extraJavaOptions` _and_ `spark.*.defaultJavaOptions`, adds the \"supplemental\" options, and then resaves the result in `spark.*.extraJavaOptions`. This is because DRIVER_JAVA_OPTIONS is a config like:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  private[spark] val DRIVER_JAVA_OPTIONS =\r\n    ConfigBuilder(SparkLauncher.DRIVER_EXTRA_JAVA_OPTIONS)\r\n      .withPrepended(SparkLauncher.DRIVER_DEFAULT_JAVA_OPTIONS)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is `spark.*.defaultJavaOptions` being added multiple times to `spark.*.extraJavaOptions`, and when the full options are actually pulled to launch a process, three copies of what was in the `spark.*.defaultJavaOptions` ends up being included on the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n$ pyspark --conf spark.driver.defaultJavaOptions=\"-Dfoo=bar\"\r\n>>>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `BarrierTaskContextSuite.successively sync with allGather and barrier` test case to be robust.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test case asserts the duration of partitions. However, this is flaky because we don't know when a partition is triggered before `barrier` sync.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0e75d19a736aa18fe77414991ebb7e3577a43af8/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/BarrierTaskContextSuite.scala#L116-L118\r\n\r\nAlthough we added `TestUtils.waitUntilExecutorsUp` at Apache Spark 3.0.0 like the following,\r\n\r\n- #28658\r\n\r\nlet's say a partition starts slowly than `38ms` and all partitions sleep `1s` exactly. Then, the test case fails like the following.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11298639789/job/31428018075\r\n```\r\nBarrierTaskContextSuite:\r\n...\r\n- successively sync with allGather and barrier *** FAILED ***\r\n  1038 was not less than or equal to 1000 (BarrierTaskContextSuite.scala:118)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the failure history here (SPARK-49983) and SPARK-31730, the slowness seems to be less than `200ms` when it happens. So, this PR aims to reduce the flakiness by capping the sleep up to 500ms while keeping the `1s` validation. There is no test coverage change because this test case focuses on the `successively sync with allGather and battier`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only test case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

to build the RDD, which will execute all AQE stages except the result stage. If any of them failed, the failure will be cached by lazy RDD val.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `AsyncRDDActionsSuite.FutureAction result, timeout` test case to be robust.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce the flakiness in GitHub Action CI. Previously, the sleep time is identical to the timeout time. It causes a flakiness in some environments like GitHub Action.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/11298639789/job/31428018075\r\n```\r\nAsyncRDDActionsSuite:\r\n...\r\n- FutureAction result, timeout *** FAILED ***\r\n  Expected exception java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown (AsyncRDDActionsSuite.scala:206)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a test-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-15T23:14:17Z","updated_at":"2024-10-16T14:23:54Z","closed_at":"2024-10-16T14:23:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f87d482907c179a93ca7e71aae8d155d3d42c090","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48485/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48485/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48485/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d61d5460725964f50fd1a791903532a6896d1ca","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49981","ref":"SPARK-49981","sha":"4d61d5460725964f50fd1a791903532a6896d1ca","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPreviously, the output deprecation warning happens in the `spark.session` function, in this PR, we move it to the `.onAttach` function so it will be triggered whenever library is attached \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI believe having the warning message on attach time have the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- **Have a more prompt warning.** If the deprecation is for the whole package instead of just the `sparkR.session` function, it is more intuitive for the warning to show up on attach time instead of waiting til later time\r\n- **Do not rely on the assumption of \"every sparkR user will run sparkR.session method\".** This asumption may not hold true all the time. For example, some hosted spark platform like Databricks already configure the spark session in the background and therefore will not show the error message. So making this change should make sure a broader reach for this warning notification\r\n- **Less intrusive warning**. Previous warning show up every time `sparkR.session` is called, but the new warning message will only show up once even if user run multiple `library`/`require` commands\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n**Yes**\r\n1.

The objects are allocated due to deep recursion in the `gatherCommutative` method which uses `flatmap` recursively. Each invocation of `flatmap` creates a new temporary Scala collection. Our claim is based on the following stack trace (>1K lines) of a thread in the driver below, truncated here for brevity:\r\n```\r\n\"HiveServer2-Background-Pool: Thread-9867\" #9867 daemon prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007f35080bf000 nid=0x33e7 runnable [0x00007f3393372000]\r\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n   \tat scala.collection.immutable.List$Appender$1.apply(List.scala:350)\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.List$Appender$1.apply(List.scala:341)\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.List.flatMap(List.scala:431)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CommutativeExpression.gatherCommutative(Expression.scala:1479)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CommutativeExpression.$anonfun$gatherCommutative$1(Expression.scala:1479)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CommutativeExpression$$Lambda$5280/143713747.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.List.flatMap(List.scala:366)\r\n....\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CommutativeExpression.gatherCommutative(Expression.scala:1479)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CommutativeExpression.$anonfun$gatherCommutative$1(Expression.scala:1479)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CommutativeExpression$$Lambda$5280/143713747.apply(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.List.flatMap(List.scala:366)\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by using a stack-based iterative computation, completely avoiding the creation of temporary Scala objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRollback of transform function signature from SPARK-49568 to SPARK-49029.\r\n\r\nSPARK-49961 notes an API bug introduced during SPARK-49568 with changes applied to SPARK-49029.  The bug fix reintroduces the aaf61e69 change and applies the same to sql.Dataset.  Without this change compilation of code using transform will break due to incorrect types.  Scala code compiles with just the base api.Dataset change but Java will not, hence the sql.Dataset change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport sparkSession.implicits._\r\nval ds = Seq(1, 2).toDS()\r\nval f: Dataset[Int] => Dataset[Int] = d => d.selectExpr(\"(value + 1) value\").as[Int]\r\nval transformed = ds.transform(f)\r\nassert(transformed.collect().sorted === Array(2, 3)) \r\n```\r\n\r\nfails to compile.  With this (re)patch it succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo - as per previous versions (yes from 4.0.0-preview2)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nSimple tests introduced for Scala and Java interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n4.0.0-preview2 introduced, as part of SPARK-49025 pr #47785, changes which drive ExpressionEncoder derivation purely from AgnosticEncoders.  This PR adds a trait:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n@DeveloperApi\r\ntrait AgnosticExpressionPathEncoder[T]\r\n  extends AgnosticEncoder[T] {\r\n  def toCatalyst(input: Expression): Expression\r\n  def fromCatalyst(inputPath: Expression): Expression\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand hooks in the De/SerializationBuildHelper matches to allow seamless extension of non-connect custom encoders (such as [frameless](https://github.com/typelevel/frameless) or [sparksql-scalapb](https://github.com/scalapb/sparksql-scalapb)).\r\n\r\nSPARK-49960 provides the same information.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout this change (or similar) there is no way for custom encoders to integrate with 4.0.0-preview2 derived encoders, something which has worked and devs have benefited from since pre 2.4 days.  This stops code such as Dataset.joinWith from deriving a tuple encoder which works (as the provided ExpressionEncoder is now discarded under preview2).  Supplying a custom AgnosticEncoder under preview2 also fails as only the preview2 AgnosticEncoders are supported in De/SerializationBuildHelper, triggering a MatchError.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTest was added using a \"custom\" string encoder and joinWith based on an existing joinWith test.  Removing the case statements in either BuildHelper will trigger the MatchError.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore this PR, store assignment policy is validated for `V2Write` command when `v2Write.table.resolved && v2Write.query.resolved && !v2Write.outputResolved` is true. However, `!v2Write.outputResolved` doesn't hold for DataFrameWriterV2 API and the policy is not validated. This PR validates store assignment policy for `V2Write` command without any conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLEGACY store assignment policy should not be allowed writing to v2 table with DataFrameWriterV2 API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAn `AnalysisError` will be thrown when users write to v2 table with DataFrameWriterV2 API and  `spark.sql.storeAssignmentPolicy=LEGACY`  \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter [SPARK-40194](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37631), the current behavior of the split function is as follows:\r\n```\r\nselect split('hello', 'h', 1) // result is [\"hello\"]\r\nselect split('hello', '-', 1) // result is [\"hello\"]\r\nselect split('hello', '', 1)  // result is [\"h\"]\r\n\r\nselect split('1A2A3A4', 'A', 3) // result is [\"1\",\"2\",\"3A4\"]\r\nselect split('1A2A3A4', '', 3)  // result is [\"1\",\"A\",\"2\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the function's description, when the limit is greater than zero, the last element of the split result should contain the remaining part of the input string.\r\n```\r\nArguments:\r\n      * str - a string expression to split.\r\n      * regex - a string representing a regular expression. The regex string should be a Java regular expression.\r\n      * limit - an integer expression which controls the number of times the regex is applied.\r\n          * limit > 0: The resulting array's length will not be more than `limit`, and the resulting array's last entry will contain all input beyond the last matched regex.\r\n          * limit <= 0: `regex` will be applied as many times as possible, and the resulting array can be of any size. \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the split function produces incorrect results with an empty regex and a limit. The correct result should be: \r\n```\r\nselect split('hello', '', 1)    // result is [\"hello\"]\r\n\r\nselect split('1A2A3A4', '', 3)  // result is [\"1\",\"A\",\"2A3A4\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nWhen the empty regex parameter is provided along with a limit parameter greater than 0, the output of the split function changes.\r\nBefore this patch\r\n```\r\nselect split('hello', '', 1)          // result is [\"h\"]\r\nselect split('1A2A3A4', '', 3)  // result is [\"1\",\"A\",\"2\"]\r\n```\r\nAfter this patch \r\n```\r\nselect split('hello', '', 1)          // result is [\"hello\"]\r\nselect split('1A2A3A4', '', 3)  // result is [\"1\",\"A\",\"2A3A4\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- To Remove the dependency of `javax.ws.rs.ws-rs-api` as it's no longer required. \r\n\r\nPrior discussion can be found on:\r\n - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41340\r\n - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45154\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the past, the codebase used to have a few .scala classes referencing and using the `ws-rs-api`, such as https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/b7fdc23ccc5967de5799d8cf6f14289e71f29a1e#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8R624-R627\r\n\r\nHowever as the time passed by, all usages of `ws-rs-api` are either got removed / refactored. Hence there is no need to have it import on root POM as now and we can always re-introduce it later, if the usage can be justified again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit-test, to make sure the codebase is not impacted by the removal of the dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-14T21:09:26Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T22:23:27Z","closed_at":"2024-10-15T22:23:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e10308f45a81f60dce7600d30865b2301e0c4ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1976fd294d6a6d4a07d9292bb02d68ce5cec356","head":{"label":"hiufung-kwok:ft-hf-SPARK-49963-remove-ws-rs-api","ref":"ft-hf-SPARK-49963-remove-ws-rs-api","sha":"a1976fd294d6a6d4a07d9292bb02d68ce5cec356","user":{"login":"hiufung-kwok","id":170855298,"node_id":"U_kgDOCi8Lgg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170855298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok","html_url":"https://github.com/hiufung-kwok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":806050858,"node_id":"R_kgDOMAtcKg","name":"spark","full_name":"hiufung-kwok/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hiufung-kwok","id":170855298,"node_id":"U_kgDOCi8Lgg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170855298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok","html_url":"https://github.com/hiufung-kwok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiufung-kwok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hiufung-kwok/spark","description":"Apache

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimplifying the AbstractStringType hierarchy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe addition of trim-sensitive collation (#48336) highlighted the complexity of extending the existing AbstractStringType structure. Besides adding a new parameter to all types inheriting from AbstractStringType, it caused changing the logic of every subclass as well as changing the name of a derived class StringTypeAnyCollation into StringTypeWithCaseAccentSensitivity which could again be subject to change if we keep adding new specifiers.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, the introduction of support for indeterminate collation would further complicate these types. To address this, the proposed changes simplify the design by consolidating common logic into a single base class. This base class will handle core functionality such as trim or indeterminate collation, while a derived class, StringTypeWithCollation (previously awkwardly called StringTypeWithCaseAccentSensitivity), will manage collation specifiers.\r\n\r\nThis approach allows for easier future extensions: fundamental checks can be handled in the base class, while any new specifiers can be added as optional fields in StringTypeWithCollation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWith existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ColumnarArray` represents an array containing elements from `data[offset]` to `data[offset + length)`. When copying the array, the null flag should also be read starting from `offset` rather than 0.\r\n\r\nSome expressions depend on this utility function. For example, this bug can lead to incorrect results in `ArrayTransform`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix correctness issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTwo unit tests, one with `ArrayTransform`, and the other tests `ColumnarArray` directly. Both the tests would fail without the change in the PR.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr is add AVA_OPTION_PURE_MODE configuration item. When the configuration item is set to true, JavaOptions cannot be configured.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdding JAVA_OPTION_PURE_MODE can completely prevent command injection caused by Java parameters in Yarn mode. This is more secure when JVM parameters do not need to be customized.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? \r\nYes. If JAVA_OPTION_PURE_MODE is set to true, JavaOptions cannot be set.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new UT.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
