What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12047/files#diff-94a1f59bcc9b6758c4ca874652437634R529, we may split field expressions codes in `CreateExternalRow` to support wide table. However, the whole stage codegen framework doesn't support it, because the input for expressions is not always the input row, but can be `CodeGenContext.currentVars`, which doesn't work well with `CodeGenContext.splitExpressions`.\n\nActually we do have a check to guard against this cases, but it's incomplete, it only checks output fields.\n\nThis PR improves the whole stage codegen support check, to disable it if there are too many input fields, so that we can avoid splitting field expressions codes in `CreateExternalRow` for whole stage codegen.\n\nTODO: Is it a better solution if we can make `CodeGenContext.currentVars` work well with `CodeGenContext.splitExpressions`?\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in DatasetSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-04-12T03:53:02Z","updated_at":"2016-05-24T04:44:10Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T06:00:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f88db7aaa8c53a63d083757829712e53e677933f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12322/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12322/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12322/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d63e15188b2477a21ea5fd8ba9d5a285dad46a1","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:codegen","ref":"codegen","sha":"4d63e15188b2477a21ea5fd8ba9d5a285dad46a1","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn this PR, we are trying to address the comment in the original PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/dfce9665c4b2b29a19e6302216dae2800da68ff9#commitcomment-17057030\n\nIn this PR, we checks if table/view exists at the beginning and then does not need to capture the exceptions, including `NoSuchTableException` and `InvalidTableException`. We still capture the NonFatal exception when doing `sqlContext.cacheManager.tryUncacheQuery`. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases should cover the code changes of this PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch provides a first cut of python APIs for structured streaming. This PR provides the new classes:\n- ContinuousQuery\n- Trigger\n- ProcessingTime\n  in pyspark under `pyspark.sql.streaming`.\n\nIn addition, it contains the new methods added under:\n-  `DataFrameWriter`\n   a) `startStream`\n   b) `trigger`\n   c) `queryName`\n-  `DataFrameReader`\n   a) `stream`\n- `DataFrame`\n  a) `isStreaming`\n\nThis PR doesn't contain all methods exposed for `ContinuousQuery`, for example:\n- `exception`\n- `sourceStatuses`\n- `sinkStatus`\n\nThey may be added in a follow up. \n\nThis PR also contains some very minor doc fixes in the Scala side.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPython doc tests\n\nTODO:\n- [ ] verify Python docs look

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen FileSourceStrategy is used, record reader is created which incurs a NN call internally. Later in OrcRelation.unwrapOrcStructs, it ends ups reading the file information to get the ObjectInspector. This incurs additional NN call. It would be good to avoid this additional NN call (specifically for partitioned datasets).  \n\nAdded OrcRecordReader which is very similar to OrcNewInputFormat.OrcRecordReader with an option of exposing the ObjectInspector. This eliminates the need to look up the file later for generating the object inspector. This would be specifically be useful for partitioned tables/datasets.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan tpc-ds queries manually and also verified by running

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nShutting down `QueuedThreadPool` used by Jetty `Server` to avoid threads leakage after SparkContext is stopped.\n\nNote: If this fix is going to apply to the `branch-1.6`, one more patch on the `NettyRpcEnv` class is needed so that the `NettyRpcEnv._fileServer.shutdown` is called in the `NettyRpcEnv.cleanup` method. This is due to the removal of `_fileServer` field in the `NettyRpcEnv` class in the master branch. Please advice if a second PR is necessary for bring this fix back to `branch-1.6`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan the ./dev/run-tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis task will copy the Vector and Matrix classes from mllib to ml package in mllib-local jar. The UDTs and `since` annotation in ml vector and matrix will be removed from now. UDTs will be achieved by #SPARK-14487, and `since` will be replaced by /\\* @ since 1.2.0 */\n\nThe BLAS implementation will be copied, and some of the test utilities will be copies as well. \n\nSummary of changes:\n1. In mllib-local/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**ml**/linalg/BLAS.scala\n   - Copied from mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**mllib**/linalg/BLAS.scala\n   - logDebug(\"gemm: alpha is equal to 0 and beta is equal to 1. Returning C.\") is removed in ml version.\n2. In  mllib-local/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**ml**/linalg/Matrices.scala\n   - Copied from mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**mllib**/linalg/Matrices.scala\n   - `@Since` was removed, and we'll use standard `/* @Since /*` Java doc. Will be in another PR.\n   - `UDT` related code was removed, and will use `SPARK-13944` https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12259  to replace the annotation. \n3. In mllib-local/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**ml**/linalg/Vectors.scala\n   - Copied from mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**mllib**/linalg/Vectors.scala\n   - `@Since` was removed.\n   - `UDT` related code was removed.\n   - In `def parseNumeric`, it was throwing `throw new SparkException(s\"Cannot parse $other.\")`, and now it's throwing `throw new IllegalArgumentException(s\"Cannot parse $other.\")`\n4. In mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**mllib**/linalg/Vectors.scala\n   - For consistency with ML version of vector, `def parseNumeric` is now throwing `throw new IllegalArgumentException(s\"Cannot parse $other.\")`\n5. mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**mllib**/util/NumericParser.scala is moved to mllib-local/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/**ml**/util/NumericParser.scala\n   - All the `throw new SparkException` were replaced by `throw new IllegalArgumentException`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-12T01:56:30Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T19:03:38Z","closed_at":"2016-04-15T08:18:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c61999b2b6bf952a9498a3927643beef1530225","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12317/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12317/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12317/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e626d1dca729b6e33835d3fa87e1acb7a37aa510","head":{"label":"dbtsai:dbtsai-ml-vector","ref":"dbtsai-ml-vector","sha":"e626d1dca729b6e33835d3fa87e1acb7a37aa510","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore we are using `AnalysisException`, `ParseException`, `NoSuchFunctionException` etc when a parsing error encounters. I am trying to make it consistent and also **minimum** code impact to the current implementation by changing the class hierarchy. \n1. `NoSuchItemException` is removed, since it is an abstract class and it just simply takes a message string.\n2. `NoSuchDatabaseException`, `NoSuchTableException`, `NoSuchPartitionException` and `NoSuchFunctionException` now extends `AnalysisException`, as well as `ParseException`, they are all under `AnalysisException` umbrella, but you can also determine how to use them in a granular way.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases should cover this patch.\n","created_at":"2016-04-12T00:36:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T22:12:36Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T20:45:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4fdcb53367f59cc56541d525b738b2dd1b4cdf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8ec506980dcbb6f8f6eee7db3fe31fb6085eaded","head":{"label":"bomeng:SPARK-14414","ref":"SPARK-14414","sha":"8ec506980dcbb6f8f6eee7db3fe31fb6085eaded","user":{"login":"bomeng","id":295781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng","html_url":"https://github.com/bomeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"75e05a5a964c9585dd09a2ef6178881929bab1f1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes are proposed in this pull request?\n1. This updates the logic to resolve output table from the incoming `LogicalPlan`. It catches cases where there are too many data columns and throws an `AnalysisException` rather than silently dropping the extra data. It also improves the error message when there are too few columns and warns when the output columns appear to be out of order.\n2. This combines the pre-insert casts for Hive's `MetastoreRelation` with the pre-insert cast and rename for `LogicalRelations`. Both are now handled as a single `ResolveOutputColumns` step in the analyzer that implements the above improvements. <s>Casts are now UpCasts to avoid silently adding incorrect casts when columns are misaligned.</s> Casts are still somewhat unsafe and should be fixed in a follow-up PR.\n3. This adds a by-name column resolution strategy that matches output columns to the incoming data by name. <s>This is exposed on the `DataFrameWriter`</s>:\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch includes unit tests that exercise the cases outlined above.\n","created_at":"2016-04-12T00:23:09Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T18:48:00Z","closed_at":"2018-07-26T18:48:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/906e68d071daf4e2f15b0f2017b248b872bb6285","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-14543-fix-hive-write-cast-and-rename","ref":"SPARK-14543-fix-hive-write-cast-and-rename","sha":"906e68d071daf4e2f15b0f2017b248b872bb6285","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improve the performance of SQL UI by:\n\n1) remove the details column in all executions page (the first page in SQL tab). We can check the details by enter the execution page.\n2) break-all is super slow in Chrome recently, so switch to break-word.\n3) Using \"display: none\" to hide a block.\n4) using one js closure for  for all the executions, not one for each.\n5) remove the height limitation of details, don't need to scroll it in the tiny window.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExists

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently PipedRDD internally uses PrintWriter to write data to the stdin of the piped process, which by default uses a BufferedWriter of buffer size 8k. In our experiment, we have seen that 8k buffer size is too small and the job spends significant amount of CPU time in system calls to copy the data. We should have a way to configure the buffer size for the writer.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan PipedRDDSuite tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds support for in/exists predicate subqueries to Spark. Predicate sub-queries are used as a filtering condition in a query (this is the only supported use case). A predicate sub-query comes in two forms:\n- `[NOT] EXISTS(subquery)`\n- `[NOT] IN (subquery)`\n\nThis PR is (loosely) based on the work of @davies (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10706) and @chenghao-intel (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9055). They should be credited for the work they did.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nModified parsing unit tests.\nAdded tests to `org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite`\n\ncc @rxin, @davies &

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSuppose a sendMsg function depends on the state of a edge's vertices to send messages, and those Pregel messages update such state. In this scenario, initialMsg will initially enforce the same message on all vertices, effectively removing a custom initialization one may have per vertex.\n\nTo deal with this situation, we must define a dummy initMsg (i.e. None), and all Pregel functions must be modified to handle this type of message. A simpler and less cumbersome solution is to make initMsg and the initialization step in Pregel optional.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new tests were added. Some tests were updated. Previous functionality was kept.\n","created_at":"2016-04-11T17:22:49Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T07:07:09Z","closed_at":"2020-01-15T07:06:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1613dae08f952c1673b26c56c5cfa6f9bd288304","head":{"label":"adeandrade:pregel-optional-initmessage","ref":"pregel-optional-initmessage","sha":"1613dae08f952c1673b26c56c5cfa6f9bd288304","user":{"login":"adeandrade","id":313191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzE5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/313191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade","html_url":"https://github.com/adeandrade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47136013,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEzNjAxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"adeandrade/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adeandrade","id":313191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzE5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/313191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade","html_url":"https://github.com/adeandrade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adeandrade/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor dense rows, compute covariance more accurately by centering in computeCovariance (sparse case remains untouched). Also compute column means more accurately with computeColumnSummaryStatistics\n\nCC @mengxr -- am I missing anything here? seems OK for the dense case.\nI'd like to back-port to 1.6 or even 1.5 if this looks OK.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins test, including new test mentioned in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn order to separate the linear algebra, and vector matrix classes into a standalone jar, we need to setup the build first. This PR will create a new jar called mllib-local with minimal dependencies. \n\nThe previous PR was failing the build because of `spark-core:test` dependency, and that was reverted. In this PR, `FunSuite` with `// scalastyle:ignore funsuite` in mllib-local test was used, similar to sketch. \n\nThanks.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests\n\n@mengxr @tedyu @holdenk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen netty transfer data that is not `FileRegion`, data will be in format of `ByteBuf`, If the data is large, there will occur significant performance issue because there is memory copy underlying in `sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.write`, the CPU is 100% used, and network is very low.\n\nIn this PR, if data size is large, we will split it into small chunks to call `WritableByteChannel.write()`, so that avoid wasting of memory copy. Because the data can't be written within a single write, and it will call `transferTo` multiple times. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nSpark unit test and manual test.\nManual test:\n`sc.parallelize(Array(1,2,3),3).mapPartitions(a=>Array(new Array[Double](1024 * 1024 * 50)).iterator).reduce((a,b)=> a).length`\n\nFor more details, please refer to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- SparkR glm supports families and link functions which match R's signature for family.\n- SparkR glm API refactor. The comparative standard of the new API is R glm, so I only expose the arguments that R glm supports: `formula, family, data, epsilon and maxit`.\n- This PR is focus on glm() and predict(), summary statistics will be done in a separate PR after this get in.\n- This PR depends on #12287 which make GLMs support link prediction at Scala side. After that merged, I will add more tests for predict() to this PR.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests.\n\ncc @mengxr @jkbradley @hhbyyh

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPhysical files stored in Hive as ORC would have internal columns as _col1,_col2 etc and column mapping would be available in HiveMetastore.  It was possible to query ORC tables stored in Hive via Spark's beeline client in earlier branches, and with master branch this was broken. When reading ORC files, it would be good map hive schema to physical schema for supporting backward compatibility.  This PR addresses this issue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual execution of TPC-DS queries at 200 GB scale.\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\n\n…in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix memory leak in the Sorter. When the UnsafeExternalSorter spills the data to disk, it does not free up the underlying pointer array. As a result, we see a lot of executor OOM and also memory under utilization.\nThis is a regression partially introduced in PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9241\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by running a job and observed around 30% speedup after this change.\n","created_at":"2016-04-10T08:09:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T08:47:56Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T23:11:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92a084bcad848b5961570b80c3306e8932c18fb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12285/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12285/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12285/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d89adf8e514afb502b8adbac050a32c1672549ff","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:executor_oom","ref":"executor_oom","sha":"d89adf8e514afb502b8adbac050a32c1672549ff","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, we use java HashMap for HashedRelation if the key could fit within a Long. The java HashMap and CompactBuffer are not memory efficient, the memory used by them is also accounted accurately.\n\nThis PR introduce a LongToUnsafeRowMap (similar to BytesToBytesMap) for better memory efficiency and performance.\n\nThis PR reopen #12190 to fix bugs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

Check your build definition for\n[error] missing or conflicting dependencies.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR updates MLlib APIs to accept `Dataset[_]` as input where `DataFrame` was the input type. This PR doesn't change the output type. In Java, `Dataset[_]` maps to `Dataset<?>`, which includes `Dataset<Row>`. Some implementations were changed in order to return `DataFrame`. Tests and examples were updated. Note that this is a breaking change for subclasses of Transformer/Estimator.\n\nLol, we don't have to rename the input argument, which has been `dataset` since Spark 1.2.\n\nTODOs:\n- [x] update

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12234 to 1.6. Original description below:\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for better handling of exceptions inside catch blocks if the code within the block throws an exception. For instance here is the code in a catch block before this change in `WriterContainer.scala`: \n\n``` scala\nlogError(\"Aborting task.\", cause)\n// call failure callbacks first, so we could have a chance to cleanup the writer.\nTaskContext.get().asInstanceOf[TaskContextImpl].markTaskFailed(cause)\nif (currentWriter != null) {\n  currentWriter.close()\n}\nabortTask()\nthrow new SparkException(\"Task failed while writing rows.\", cause)\n```\n\nIf `markTaskFailed` or `currentWriter.close` throws an exception, we currently lose the original cause. This PR fixes this problem by implementing a utility function `Utils.tryWithSafeCatch` that suppresses (`Throwable.addSuppressed`) the exception that are thrown within the catch block and rethrowing the original exception.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new functionality added\n","created_at":"2016-04-09T07:04:59Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T18:14:24Z","closed_at":"2016-04-11T18:14:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ff3539b6931225c7933e1a8c6468e0a25b4f5f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0defe220b3f6df7979483ce5959e5485e56353c6","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:fix-exception-1.6","ref":"fix-exception-1.6","sha":"0defe220b3f6df7979483ce5959e5485e56353c6","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch implements the `CREATE TABLE` command using the `SessionCatalog`. Previously we handled only `CTAS` and `CREATE TABLE ... USING`. This requires us to refactor `CatalogTable` to accept various fields (e.g. bucket and skew columns) and pass them to Hive.\n\nWIP: Note that I haven't verified whether this actually works yet! But I believe it does.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests will come in a future

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14480\n\nIn `CSVParser.scala`, there is an `Reader` wrapping `Iterator` but there are two problems by this.\n\nFirstly, it was actually not faster than processing line by line with Iterator due to additional logics to wrap `Iterator` to `Reader`.\nSecondly, this brought a bit of complexity because it needs additional logics to allow every line to be read bytes by bytes. So, it was pretty difficult to figure out issues about parsing, (eg. SPARK-14103).\n\nTo cut in short, this PR includes two changes,\n- Parse CSV data with `Iterator` not `Reader`.\n- Refactor CSV data source to be consistent with JSON data source.\n\nThis PR removes classes `CSVParser` and introduces new classes `UnivocityParser`, `UnivocityGenerator` and `CSVUtils` to be consistent with JSON data source (`JacksonParser`, `JacksonGenerator` and `JacksonUtils`). Also, `DefaultSource` moves to `CSVRelation` just like `JSONRelation`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-04-09T03:37:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:40Z","closed_at":"2016-06-21T06:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9aecf886926d6d1f7e76ae8dd201c39433eda0cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12268/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12268/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12268/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7abdfc111166f2bf275fc4318c0ffe8836dcbb70","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14480","ref":"SPARK-14480","sha":"7abdfc111166f2bf275fc4318c0ffe8836dcbb70","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR tries to separate the serialization and deserialization logic from object operators, so that it's easier to eliminate unnecessary

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nNow, when executor is removed by driver with heartbeats timeout, driver will re-queue the task on this executor and send a kill command to cluster to kill this executor.\nBut, in a situation, the running task of this executor is finished and return result to driver before this executor killed by kill command sent by driver. At this situation, driver will accept the task finished event and ignore speculative task and re-queued task. \nBut, as we know, this executor has removed by driver, the result of this finished task can not save in driver because the BlockManagerId has also removed from BlockManagerMaster by driver. So, the result data of this stage is not complete, and then, it will cause fetch failure. For more details, [link to jira issues SPARK-14485](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14485)\nThis PR introduce a mechanism to ignore this kind of task finished.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-04-08T07:58:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T23:43:00Z","closed_at":"2016-06-07T23:34:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31bcca5fbf800b82a4d6c7d067680a4b13b2fb87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b71916629320fcd23f8539c6974c5f52115e0a74","head":{"label":"zhonghaihua:ignoreTaskFinishForExecutorLostAndRemovedByDriver","ref":"ignoreTaskFinishForExecutorLostAndRemovedByDriver","sha":"b71916629320fcd23f8539c6974c5f52115e0a74","user":{"login":"zhonghaihua","id":4409429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDk0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4409429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua","html_url":"https://github.com/zhonghaihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30346856,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM0Njg1Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhonghaihua/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhonghaihua","id":4409429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDk0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4409429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua","html_url":"https://github.com/zhonghaihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhonghaihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhonghaihua/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#12123 (SPARK-14245) introduced a feature displaying user name who runs jobs on AllJobsPage.\n\nUser names are pulled from the system property \"user.name\" but the property means who runs an application and each jobs in an application can be run by different users.  \nOne example is the case of using ThriftServer.  \nThriftServer is run by a user but queries are not always submitted by the user.                                                                                \n\nThis patch resolve this issue and displaying user name for each job and query on WebUI.  \nFollowing screenshots are the example of querying through ThriftServer run by root.                                                                           \n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBased on our tests, gzip decompression is very slow (< 100MB/s), making queries decompression bound. Snappy can decompress at ~ 500MB/s on a single core.\n\nThis patch changes the default compression codec for Parquet output from gzip to snappy, and also introduces a ParquetOptions class to be more consistent with other data sources (e.g. CSV, JSON).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nShould be covered by existing unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-08T07:17:03Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T06:53:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-09T06:53:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a89c0fdb993969d045b0dd442a7bb68e05a708ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12256/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12256/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12256/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/70ea5f88a3eaf878379acaf0e31597c297cdb8d4","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14482","ref":"SPARK-14482","sha":"70ea5f88a3eaf878379acaf0e31597c297cdb8d4","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere are many operations that are currently not supported in the streaming execution. For example:\n- joining two streams\n- unioning a stream and a batch source\n- sorting\n- window functions (not time windows)\n- distinct aggregates\n\nFurthermore, executing a query with a stream source as a batch query should also fail.\n\nThis patch add an additional step after analysis in the QueryExecution which will check that all the operations in the analyzed logical plan is supported or not.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch updates FileScanRDD to start reading from the next file while the current file\nis being processed. The goal is to have better interleaving of CPU and IO. It does this\nby launching a future which will asynchronously start preparing the next file to be read.\nThe expectation is that the async task is IO intensive and the current file (which\nincludes all the computation for the query plan) is CPU intensive. For some file formats,\nthis would just mean opening the file and the initial setup. For file formats like\nparquet, this would mean doing all the IO for all the columns.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nGood coverage from existing tests. Added a new one to test the flag. Cluster testing on tpcds queries.\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T21:50:02Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T09:19:43Z","closed_at":"2017-02-17T09:19:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc11dd580a751b2e39694223ecbf1fa2b4a7bdc0","head":{"label":"nongli:interleave","ref":"interleave","sha":"bc11dd580a751b2e39694223ecbf1fa2b4a7bdc0","user":{"login":"nongli","id":242468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli","html_url":"https://github.com/nongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30051398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDA1MTM5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"nongli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nongli","id":242468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli","html_url":"https://github.com/nongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nongli/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn order to separate the linear algebra, and vector matrix classes into a standalone jar, we need to setup the build first. This PR will create a new jar called mllib-local with minimal dependencies. The test scope will still depend on spark-core and spark-core-test in order to use the common utilities, but the runtime will avoid any platform dependency. Couple platform independent classes will be moved to this package to demonstrate how this work.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHere is why SPARK-14437 happens:\nBlockManagerId is created using NettyBlockTransferService.hostName which comes from `customHostname`. And `Executor` will set `customHostname` to the hostname which is detected by the driver. However, the driver may not be able to detect the correct address in some complicated network (Netty's Channel.remoteAddress doesn't always return a connectable address). In such case, `BlockManagerId` will be created using a wrong hostname.\n\nTo fix this issue, this PR uses `hostname` provided by `SparkEnv.create` to create `NettyBlockTransferService` and set `NettyBlockTransferService.hostname` to this one directly. A bonus of this approach is NettyBlockTransferService won't bound to `0.0.0.0` which is much safer.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually checked the bound address using local-cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis detects a relation's partitioning and adds checks to the analyzer.\nIf an InsertIntoTable node has no partitioning, it is replaced by the\nrelation's partition scheme and input columns are correctly adjusted,\nplacing the partition columns at the end in partition order. If an\nInsertIntoTable node has partitioning, it is checked against the table's\nreported partitions.\n\nThese changes required adding a PartitionedRelation trait to the catalog\ninterface because Hive's MetastoreRelation doesn't extend\nCatalogRelation.\n\nThis commit also includes a fix to InsertIntoTable's resolved logic,\nwhich now detects that all expected columns are present, including\ndynamic partition columns. Previously, the number of expected columns\nwas not checked and resolved was true if there were missing columns.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis adds new tests to the InsertIntoTableSuite that are fixed by this PR.\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T16:55:25Z","updated_at":"2016-05-09T15:23:45Z","closed_at":"2016-05-09T09:03:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a45b749f62d709960837625cee7bd2d30fbfce64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2130db80e6717060aad7f37f445cad6ec861252d","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-14459-detect-hive-partitioning","ref":"SPARK-14459-detect-hive-partitioning","sha":"2130db80e6717060aad7f37f445cad6ec861252d","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

unresolved \"spark_gropuing_id\" virtual attribute, then resolved by ResolveMissingAttribute.\n\nThis PR also fix the HAVING clause that access a grouping column that is not presented in SELECT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for better handling of exceptions inside catch blocks if the code within the block throws an exception. For instance here is the code in a catch block before this change in `WriterContainer.scala`: \n\n``` scala\nlogError(\"Aborting task.\", cause)\n// call failure callbacks first, so we could have a chance to cleanup the writer.\nTaskContext.get().asInstanceOf[TaskContextImpl].markTaskFailed(cause)\nif (currentWriter != null) {\n  currentWriter.close()\n}\nabortTask()\nthrow new SparkException(\"Task failed while writing rows.\", cause)\n```\n\nIf `markTaskFailed` or `currentWriter.close` throws an exception, we currently lose the original cause. This PR fixes this problem by implementing a utility function `Utils.tryWithSafeCatch` that suppresses (`Throwable.addSuppressed`) the exception that are thrown within the catch block and rethrowing the original exception.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new functionality added\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T06:40:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T00:56:43Z","closed_at":"2016-04-09T00:25:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e57a907e1dd398afedffaade96ca9903b9b5a354","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e41cae8a8a3fb248e643d68d5e9d144292b6ad2f","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:fix-exception","ref":"fix-exception","sha":"e41cae8a8a3fb248e643d68d5e9d144292b6ad2f","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe Scala Dataset public API currently only allows users to specify encoders through SQLContext.implicits. This is OK but sometimes people want to explicitly get encoders without a SQLContext (e.g. Aggregator implementations). This patch adds public APIs to Encoders class for getting Scala encoders.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNone - I will update test cases once https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12231 is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we first introduced Aggregators, we required the user of Aggregators to (implicitly) specify the encoders. It would actually make more sense to have the encoders be specified by the implementation of Aggregators, since each implementation should have the most state about how to encode its own data type.\n\nNote that this simplifies the Java API because Java users no longer need to explicitly specify encoders for aggregators.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T05:36:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T07:02:20Z","closed_at":"2016-04-09T07:02:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4675496b19742596177138594c73c79e1b2e8dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b759f0a24fa689cb74b42b4102ee9023d770da7e","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14451","ref":"SPARK-14451","sha":"b759f0a24fa689cb74b42b4102ee9023d770da7e","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch removes DirectParquetOutputCommitter. This was initially created by Databricks as a faster way to write Parquet data to S3. However, given how the underlying S3 Hadoop implementation works, this committer only works when there are no failures. If there are multiple attempts of the same task (e.g. speculation or task failures or node failures), the output data can be corrupted. I don't think this performance optimization outweighs the correctness issue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRemoved the related tests also.\n","created_at":"2016-04-07T04:37:08Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T21:45:33Z","closed_at":"2016-04-07T07:53:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"497fcae43d84fb753df3171d252b68c96d4bbc02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5de86b698d5da6943cca1ad9b50eb3385d24122","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-10063","ref":"SPARK-10063","sha":"c5de86b698d5da6943cca1ad9b50eb3385d24122","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror
