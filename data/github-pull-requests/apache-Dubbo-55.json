Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-08T02:23:03Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T02:28:35Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T02:28:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72e943361c6e6dd95ad2b6f953ca0c94a204899c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5294/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5294/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5294/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/04305d2704aab03dd29ff1f6e768568927cae995","head":{"label":"luoanjuan:master","ref":"master","sha":"04305d2704aab03dd29ff1f6e768568927cae995","user":{"login":"luoanjuan","id":23101555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTAxNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23101555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan","html_url":"https://github.com/luoanjuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":186521517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODY1MjE1MTc=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"luoanjuan/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoanjuan","id":23101555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTAxNTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23101555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan","html_url":"https://github.com/luoanjuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoanjuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoanjuan/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T08:36:11Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T08:37:06Z","closed_at":"2019-11-07T08:37:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b085e7ba30947dd418df986271a2f7beb14496bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e9efac0cd42eded7e3f65e5358dd7bf810e94927","head":{"label":"Zheaoli:demo-api","ref":"demo-api","sha":"e9efac0cd42eded7e3f65e5358dd7bf810e94927","user":{"login":"Zheaoli","id":7054676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQ2NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7054676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli","html_url":"https://github.com/Zheaoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":220186511,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjAxODY1MTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Zheaoli/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zheaoli","id":7054676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTQ2NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7054676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli","html_url":"https://github.com/Zheaoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zheaoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Zheaoli/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor PR: #5255 , add license header for LogUtils.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-31T08:30:02Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T10:19:54Z","closed_at":"2019-12-11T12:38:41Z","merged_at":"2019-12-11T12:38:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"938a46641ce76df26a01d5f7543b474219c78240","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

CommandHelper class \r\n2.Add private constructor to this class \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nshould not bring any side effect\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2019-10-30T01:50:28Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T14:54:44Z","closed_at":"2019-11-18T14:54:44Z","merged_at":"2019-11-18T14:54:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f1307da013987c40439eb60dbc4fb01c8a601e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/071525b9bcf7ea54b3040aab0015278b4f7d2367","head":{"label":"jamesxuhaozhe:master","ref":"master","sha":"071525b9bcf7ea54b3040aab0015278b4f7d2367","user":{"login":"jamesxuhaozhe","id":3423684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3423684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesxuhaozhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":183569011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODM1NjkwMTE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"jamesxuhaozhe/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jamesxuhaozhe","id":3423684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjM2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3423684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe","html_url":"https://github.com/jamesxuhaozhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamesxuhaozhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jamesxuhaozhe/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #5052. When generic invokes, the beginning `invocation` object (before any filters) will be used to be a callback method's parameter, such as like `onMessage`, `onError` of interface `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Filter.Listener`. However, `invocation`'s function `getMethodName` will return value:`$invoke` when it is a generic invoke.\r\n\r\nThus, it will cause `endCount` method not counting the origin method status. Then the `executes` limit is not accurate enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

shutdown stage of a project ,gracefull shut down is necessary.\r\nThere is a application listener ,but it is not enough,some actions should be done with dubbo.\r\nFor example, Kafka producer should flush messages to the broker after protocol destroyed.\r\nAnother,MQ consumer should not poll new messages any more after registries destroyed.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n\r\n1.add a interface GraceFulShutDown that support spring and SPI extension\r\n2.update SpringExtensionFactory.ShutdownHookListener to support customized actions when spring bean exists which implements GraceFullShutDown or SPI config exits\r\n3.add a unit test GraceFulShutDownTest\r\n4.update DubboShutDownHook that support GracefulShutDown\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-28T08:27:57Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T06:14:06Z","closed_at":"2020-09-02T06:14:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d02cb5ba6d89c5b3074ee500e522e972b93519cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/34","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/34/labels","id":5540134,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTU0MDEzNA==","number":34,"title":"2.7.9","description":"","creator":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":56,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-15T02:24:14Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z","due_on":"2020-08-31T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-02-08T02:36:26Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cd91bd8802fb1fb5fd3990eb448de40bb4a7095f","head":{"label":"kele6413430:master-new","ref":"master-new","sha":"cd91bd8802fb1fb5fd3990eb448de40bb4a7095f","user":{"login":"kele6413430","id":16238117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430","html_url":"https://github.com/kele6413430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177272973,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzcyNzI5NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"kele6413430/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kele6413430","id":16238117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430","html_url":"https://github.com/kele6413430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kele6413430/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

want to fix it on the branch 2.5.x \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix bug\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nfix bug (the result of sorting List<Route> is wrong), this bug was fixed in 2.6.x。but the dubboX depended on 2.5.x， hope 2.5.x can fix it\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-25T08:10:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-25T08:13:19Z","closed_at":"2019-10-25T08:13:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"9362181d1285fe89d345ebf92ec4186353f1fd02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-25T02:22:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T06:05:54Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T05:20:58Z","merged_at":"2019-11-08T05:20:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfa84998968f7f9bfc25b935b531fcf8c67fe854","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5238/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5238/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5238/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/33216a092cb3b63eb880c3e51c9eb1458ff3f03f","head":{"label":"wangkezun:fix-net-utils-bug","ref":"fix-net-utils-bug","sha":"33216a092cb3b63eb880c3e51c9eb1458ff3f03f","user":{"login":"wangkezun","id":3012882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTI4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3012882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun","html_url":"https://github.com/wangkezun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217288818,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyODg4MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wangkezun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangkezun","id":3012882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTI4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3012882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun","html_url":"https://github.com/wangkezun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkezun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangkezun/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-24T15:24:59Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T03:21:20Z","closed_at":"2019-12-18T03:18:59Z","merged_at":"2019-12-18T03:18:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"1750e47c647efdeaf758bdd482f0943d1b715c80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3a24cb04d495653fcdd3209596489e1157c5f1a8","head":{"label":"lkj41110:fix_Traversing","ref":"fix_Traversing","sha":"3a24cb04d495653fcdd3209596489e1157c5f1a8","user":{"login":"lkj41110","id":18658843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110","html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":128875781,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjg4NzU3ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"lkj41110/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lkj41110","id":18658843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110","html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

URL\r\n2. add test cases for getAuthority() in URLTest\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-17T09:58:27Z","updated_at":"2019-10-24T15:21:46Z","closed_at":"2019-10-24T15:21:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c6b60a6c745ead2f7b1b15677c1bf1493e1e8fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/25e73b5995326938c73f5b329783ab859930aaae","head":{"label":"lkj41110:fixa","ref":"fixa","sha":"25e73b5995326938c73f5b329783ab859930aaae","user":{"login":"lkj41110","id":18658843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110","html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":128875781,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjg4NzU3ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"lkj41110/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lkj41110","id":18658843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110","html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

GraceFulShutDown\r\n2.update SpringExtensionFactory.ShutdownHookListener to support customized actions when spring bean exists which implements GraceFullShutDown or SPI config exits\r\n3.add a unit test GraceFulShutDownTest\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-16T07:29:19Z","updated_at":"2019-10-22T03:44:15Z","closed_at":"2019-10-22T03:44:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ce487c01f3c924988973ef5672956bd6a27e397","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1b6bcf55de4d1668e6b5bdc08b9d62abc2fb09dc","head":{"label":"kele6413430:2.7.4-release","ref":"2.7.4-release","sha":"1b6bcf55de4d1668e6b5bdc08b9d62abc2fb09dc","user":{"login":"kele6413430","id":16238117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430","html_url":"https://github.com/kele6413430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177272973,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzcyNzI5NzM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"kele6413430/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kele6413430","id":16238117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjM4MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16238117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430","html_url":"https://github.com/kele6413430","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kele6413430/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kele6413430/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nClose #5170 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue: #5168 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor Issue #5166 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

is the purpose of the change\r\nFix #5140\r\nMake sure the address element properly populated with 3.0.14 or higher version of cxf.\r\n\r\nBrief changelog\r\nUpdate the webservice protocol, replace HTTPTransportFactory with SoapTransportFactory.\r\n\r\nVerifying this change\r\nPut cxf 3.0.14 in lib and export a webservice.\r\nUse browser to view the wsdl of the exported webservice.\r\nSee if the address element populated in the \"service\" node.\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-10T09:09:50Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T12:15:56Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T12:15:55Z","merged_at":"2020-01-16T12:15:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2f58d4b692f0b5df6a85454628c6fe7131ce30d","assignee":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfor issue #5148 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

licenseCheck.sh\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5118) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-08T03:52:35Z","updated_at":"2019-10-08T05:15:17Z","closed_at":"2019-10-08T05:10:32Z","merged_at":"2019-10-08T05:10:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"576ee2c55a1077095208e98c1e4e3896ce087487","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c7c9389064d0f784d0bc1bf9dd649be699849994","head":{"label":"drow931:dubbo_contributor_first","ref":"dubbo_contributor_first","sha":"c7c9389064d0f784d0bc1bf9dd649be699849994","user":{"login":"drow931","id":11514434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE0NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11514434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931","html_url":"https://github.com/drow931","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":213525900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTM1MjU5MDA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"drow931/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"drow931","id":11514434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE0NDM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11514434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931","html_url":"https://github.com/drow931","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drow931/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/drow931/dubbo","description":"Apache

pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nReduce object allocation when get `Method` returnTypes.\r\nThe original code allocate 2 `Optional` objects, 2 `Consumer` objects and 1 `Iterator` object each time it gets `Method` returnTypes, it will increase GC pressure.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Use ` != null` instead of  `Optional.ifPresent(Consumer)`\r\n* Use `Map<String, List<MethodModel>>`  instead of  `Map<String, Set<MethodModel>>` in `ServiceModel`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-04T04:58:21Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T12:21:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T02:46:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f86d8932faa17059d2944672811c66b9dcfce481","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need maintainers to triage"}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1e7b158b935bd33d65e8114cbe0d840e4f7f5b4d","head":{"label":"LinShunKang:performance-tuning-2.7.x","ref":"performance-tuning-2.7.x","sha":"1e7b158b935bd33d65e8114cbe0d840e4f7f5b4d","user":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:performance-tuning-2.7.x","ref":"performance-tuning-2.7.x","sha":"c48c5cfa1d9fe05fb6c3f5198638eb260759a8a2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nboth `testStoreProvider()` and `testStoreConsumer()` are unstable, and it is more likely failed in travis.\r\nThe assumption we made that the operation should be done in 1s in async mode may fail.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nBring back `testStoreProvider()`\r\nUse EtcdMetadataReport in sync mode for UT\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nut pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2019-09-19T07:04:41Z","updated_at":"2019-09-29T07:34:41Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T02:36:03Z","merged_at":"2019-09-20T02:36:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"79c61669b339d4ef1d47d5977d234a79216254cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b8320ff1d3b57be12d1e8426dc21090652608fed","head":{"label":"biyuhao:stabilize-ut","ref":"stabilize-ut","sha":"b8320ff1d3b57be12d1e8426dc21090652608fed","user":{"login":"biyuhao","id":1197310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTczMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao","html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146312405,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYzMTI0MDU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"biyuhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"biyuhao","id":1197310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTczMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao","html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-19T03:02:16Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T02:38:51Z","closed_at":"2019-09-19T03:12:59Z","merged_at":"2019-09-19T03:12:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"2443767c4677fca145e59da703e6662dbaf1414c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/27","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/27/labels","id":4418980,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDQxODk4MA==","number":27,"title":"2.7.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":100,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-18T07:07:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T13:07:08Z","due_on":"2019-09-19T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T05:43:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1662ab7ab0dd86a77a6db0b9dcec84b7bfb8460d","head":{"label":"chickenlj:revert-5072-by-logging-errormsg","ref":"revert-5072-by-logging-errormsg","sha":"1662ab7ab0dd86a77a6db0b9dcec84b7bfb8460d","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nfix #4331 \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #5052. When generic invokes, the beginning `invocation` object (before any filters) will be used to be a callback method's parameter, such as like `onResponse`, `onError` of interface `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.Filter.Listener`. However, `invocation`'s function `getMethodName` will return value:`$invoke` when it is a generic invoke.\r\n\r\nThus, it will cause `endCount` method not counting the origin method status. Then the `executes` limit is not accurate enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-16T07:09:14Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T15:45:48Z","closed_at":"2019-10-29T15:37:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c7e7cc04ad494e7ed86694b90a5b3546ad38cb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9844ea699f7e5d6af23b5022c8455c76ee3dbc89","head":{"label":"sonymoon:dubbo-5052","ref":"dubbo-5052","sha":"9844ea699f7e5d6af23b5022c8455c76ee3dbc89","user":{"login":"sonymoon","id":6781070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODEwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6781070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon","html_url":"https://github.com/sonymoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":208033146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDgwMzMxNDY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sonymoon/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sonymoon","id":6781070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODEwNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6781070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon","html_url":"https://github.com/sonymoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sonymoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sonymoon/dubbo","description":"Apache

#5049 mentioned, when `@Service(protocol = \"dubbo1\")` is annotated on a class, the provider starts failed, `dubbo1` is the `id` property of `ProtocolConfig`.\r\n```java\r\n@Bean\r\n  public ProtocolConfig config1() {\r\n    ProtocolConfig config = new ProtocolConfig();\r\n    config.setId(\"dubbo1\");\r\n    config.setName(\"dubbo\");\r\n    config.setPort(20880);\r\n    return config;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe failure cause is `dubbo1` is not an name or alias of `ProtocolConfig` bean.\r\n\r\nWhen using xml way:\r\n```xml\r\n<dubbo:application name=\"demo-provider\"/>\r\n\r\n    <dubbo:registry address=\"zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181\"/>\r\n\r\n    <dubbo:protocol name=\"dubbo\" id=\"dubbo1\"/>\r\n\r\n    <bean id=\"demoService\" class=\"org.apache.dubbo.demo.provider.DemoServiceImpl\"/>\r\n\r\n    <dubbo:service interface=\"org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService\" ref=\"demoService\" protocol=\"dubbo1\"/>\r\n```\r\nxml config with` id` property assigned with `dubbo1`, the provider starts successfully.\r\n\r\nI think the annotation way should work fine as well.\r\n\r\n### My suggestion approach\r\nUse spring extension interfaces, such as:\r\n1. BeanDefinitionRegistry: can do the registry alias stuff\r\n2. BeanPostProcessor: can do `1`  after config beans's  initialization by implementing method `postProcessAfterInitialization`, which is already implemented by class `DubboConfigBindingBeanPostProcessor` with an empty method.\r\n\r\nActually, @haiyang1985 has a PR #5051 solving this issue:\r\nBut I think using `getBean` in `postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry` method cause the initialization of ProtocolConfig's bean too early (bean registry phase in spring) as @mercyblitz mentioned

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-10T13:07:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T04:01:47Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T04:01:47Z","merged_at":"2019-09-11T04:01:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"39edc80716aaa998eedcc53a2997fa5f7ac2b0ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a9aec64277b66579b0dbcd40508a96762d57f512","head":{"label":"Hearen:master","ref":"master","sha":"a9aec64277b66579b0dbcd40508a96762d57f512","user":{"login":"Hearen","id":10859176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU5MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10859176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen","html_url":"https://github.com/Hearen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":207556682,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDc1NTY2ODI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Hearen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Hearen","id":10859176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODU5MTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10859176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen","html_url":"https://github.com/Hearen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hearen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Hearen/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-10T08:59:29Z","updated_at":"2019-09-13T08:05:00Z","closed_at":"2019-09-13T08:05:00Z","merged_at":"2019-09-13T08:05:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"60abb6dbae34162556da3bfc1867862458d7981b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/69a766074be8d577ee85349c557ad1c38844cc38","head":{"label":"canglang1973:master","ref":"master","sha":"69a766074be8d577ee85349c557ad1c38844cc38","user":{"login":"canglang1973","id":17998341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTk4MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17998341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973","html_url":"https://github.com/canglang1973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104178011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxNzgwMTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"canglang1973/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"canglang1973","id":17998341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTk4MzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17998341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973","html_url":"https://github.com/canglang1973","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canglang1973/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/canglang1973/dubbo","description":"Dubbo
