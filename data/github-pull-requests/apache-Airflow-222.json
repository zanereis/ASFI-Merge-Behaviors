I standardized it to the common style. Now all commands use dashes.  I think this is more popular than undersocre. gcloud uses underscore e.g. [`gcloud ai-platform`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai-platform), git uses undersocre also e.g. [`git ls-files`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

message/PR title starts with [AIRFLOW-NNNN]. AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID*\r\n Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n Commits follow \"How to write a good git commit message\"\r\n Relevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\n I will engage committers as explained in Contribution Workflow Example.\r\nFor document-only changes commit message can start with [AIRFLOW-XXXX].\r\nReminder to contributors:\r\n\r\nYou must add an Apache License header to all new files\r\nPlease squash your commits when possible and follow the 7 rules of good Git commits\r\nI am new to the community, I am not sure the files are at the right place or missing anything.\r\n\r\nThe sensor could be used as the first node of a dag where the second node can be a TriggerDagRunOperator. The messages are polled in a batch and the dag runs are dynamically generated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNote, as per denied PR #1415, it is important to mention these integrations are not suitable for low-latency/high-throughput/streaming.

Background\r\n\r\nCurrently `action_logging` decorator adds all values in `request.values` into `extra` field when add log to database. Due to this, CSRF tokens are also persisted in the logs.\r\n\r\n![Airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/91641450-cac74280-ea24-11ea-8a1c-6397c54943eb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What Does This PR Do\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes either `csrf_token` or `_csrf_token` from the values to be persisted into database.\r\n\r\n## Why We May Need This Change\r\n\r\n- Even though CSRF token may not be extremely sensitive, it may be better to exclude it when we add log into database. \r\n\r\n- From another perspective, persisting it in database doesn't help (no matter in terms of auditing or debugging).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#10350\r\nReplaces PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/10556\r\n\r\nIt has been reported that the last run's execution date was incorrectly being displayed for both the last run's link text as well as the \"Start Date\" in the (i) tooltip on the DAGs page. This was happening in the RBAC UI. For example, this was wrong, the \"Start Date\" was _not_ `2020-08-08T00:00:00+00:00`, that is the `execution_date`:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-28 at 11 42 09 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45696489/91604632-e4cd2c00-e923-11ea-8da5-55a2d101be94.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it so it shows the _actual_ `start_date` for the \"Start Date\" tooltip instead of the `execution_date`, like it used to do in non-RBAC (Flask-admin) UI and before the RBAC UI was changed to load the latest_dagruns asynchronously:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-28 at 11 41 00 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45696489/91605066-b4d25880-e924-11ea-8454-2c78e83d3a72.png)\r\n\r\nEver since the PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4005 which loads the latest_dagruns asynchronously the correct Start Date was lost.

PR removes a line that (1) is costly and (2) as far as I can tell does not serve a purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is this line in the extra links section of `call_modal` in the `dag.html` template:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that on tree view, in a dag with many tasks, the task instance modal loads very slowly, even over 1 minute.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis line was introduced as part of #5059.\r\n\r\nOn [line 493](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/3b32166d3f32ef70206421ecba8361e4886aa599/airflow/www/templates/airflow/dag.html#L493) you can see that the tooltip is only rendered when the extra link REST call _fails_.   When the call is successful, the tooltip is disabled.  When the call fails, the tooltip is the `error` message in the json response.\r\n\r\nThe offending line has no effect on this behavior.  But it does have a cost.\r\n\r\nCalling `$('[data-toggle=\"tooltip\"]').tooltip()` loads up every single task state square and then, I presume re-creates a tooltip on each of them.  But these objects already have a tooltip, so that doesn't make sense, and certainly not here -- because all of these squares already have tooltips by the time you are calling up the modal.\r\n\r\nRemoving this line resolves the latency problem and as far as I can tell, does not have any negative effect.\r\n\r\n@milton0825 or @ArgentFalcon if interested please take a look.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

#10616\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a fix for the issue where DAG packages (zips) which provides possibly distinct versions of a support library might receive the wrong version from a different DAG\r\n\r\n~~To facilitate the review, it isn't yet squashed as requested; there are four commits~~: _(edit: after rebasing it to master, keeping the four commits wasn't feasible anymore. )_\r\n\r\n1. Unit tests that demonstrate the issue (and fail)\r\n2. a refactoring of DagBag.process_file to break up that function into more manageable pieces \r\n3. a first-level resolution of the issue (effectively, every module loaded by a DAG within a zip is immediately taken off the global namespace, so that the next DAG pack can try again), which still fails in case a DAG zip attempts to provide a different version of an otherwise globally-supplied module (e.g. an updated tzdb or something like that)\r\n4. a correction to the previous, ensuring zipped DAG get loaded in a clean and neutral environment\r\n5. an improvement on the previous, in order to avoid unloading modules between files of the same DAG package (they will be intended to share dependencies if they have any)\r\n\r\n(Another issue that is fixed in passing is that previously, the sys.path would grow indefinitely each time the DagBag loads or reloads a zipped DAG)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-27T23:10:48Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T00:31:17Z","closed_at":"2021-03-15T00:31:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14b7664a2333e813fbe361834674d635f9e6722f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

#10434\r\n\r\nThe problem is when `execution_date` is passed in the URL unencoded for the \"Last Run\" link it results in an incorrect `pendulum` datetime when `pendulum.parse()` is used in the codebase. The time of the pendulum datetime gets incorrectly returned as `00:00:00` no matter what time the execution date has. URL encoding the `execution_date` value fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nThis was already fixed in all other places `execution_date` is used in URLs years ago with commit https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/9ec7f0f04bcec67fa62fbd85085acaa5e3b298b7, but Last Run is more recent so this was missed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

a user I want to easily wrap a function to be a dag (or TaskGroup whenever AIP-34 is approved).\r\n\r\nThis introduces @dag decorator for easier dag construction based on python functions.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n- Change `dag_run_conf_overrides_params` default to `True`. This is in order to make behaviour consistent.\r\n- Add `@dag` decorator that generates DAG on invocation (see documentation and example DAG for usage)\r\n- Change filter for `DAG_DISCOVERY_SAFE_MODE` to discover dags with `dag` in it in lowercase. This is due to `@dag` not needing any `DAG`. We can narrow this a bit if this is too generic.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeeds:\r\n- Suggestions to test it works w dag

PR addresses the following Airflow Jira issues and references them in the PR title. \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AAR-487\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n_Why this is important?_\r\nAt the moment when you spin up a training, you cannot specify an accelerator, so when you end up with a CUSTOM tier and a standard machine, you cannot add GPUs that would speed up the training process.\r\n\r\n_Documentation_\r\nIt refers to the follow [REST API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.jobs#traininginput).\r\n \r\n\r\n> Optional. The configuration for your master worker.\r\n> \r\n> You should only set masterConfig.acceleratorConfig if masterType is set to a Compute Engine machine type. Learn about restrictions on accelerator configurations for training.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.
