commit adds three utility layers to handle variable length sequences. They all take one input by default (`data` of dimensions `[max seq len, batch size, rest dims]`), and optionally takes a second argument `sequence_length` (a list of positive integers of length `batch size`), which can be activated by the option `use_sequence_length`. If no sequence lengths are given, it is assumed the sequences are all equally sized `max seq len`.\n- `SequenceLast`: returns the last element of each sequence, thus a tensor of dim `[batch size, rest dims]`\n- `SequenceReverse`: reverses each sequence. Needed for variable length bidirectional RNN.\n- `SequenceMask`: masks all elements in a tensor not part of a sequence with zero. \n\n@antinucleon @pluskid

We thus need to initialize `dw` to 0 when `kAddTo` is not used. @sbodenstein, could you help review this? Also, I'm not clear about the layout of `parameters` for multiple stacked LSTM layers. For a single layer, I find the layout is `[flatten(i2h_weight), flatten(h2h_weight), flatten(i2h_bias), flatten(h2h_bias)]`, but that doesn't hold for multiple LSTM layers.\n","created_at":"2016-09-10T06:19:51Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T12:22:20Z","closed_at":"2016-09-14T11:00:10Z","merged_at":"2016-09-14T11:00:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb6e86e7928aef155445d5bdf9845af403ae6eeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7dd716e2724ec55c66e30c025f34896a69cf9c90","head":{"label":"sxjscience:fix_rnn_req","ref":"fix_rnn_req","sha":"7dd716e2724ec55c66e30c025f34896a69cf9c90","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

It seems that you modified some shape related code of `SoftmaxOutput` in 2a9ca98e3ac12fb48848a4f88c29260f66f250b4 and a717570e3ea49f0761fef3779d88e0186f8dd6d5. It somehow broke our current speech demos (cc @antinucleon @yzhang87), and also I'm having a hard time to get the time-major layout RNN to work here. Could you give us a quick summary of what those modifications are suppose to do?\n\nSpecifically, it seems [this block](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/commit/2a9ca98e3ac12fb48848a4f88c29260f66f250b4#diff-772857f6d2e364650368f86ab6cdf11aL85) of modification is causing the issue. The original behavior of `SoftmaxOutput` is treating only the last dimension as the _class_ dimension. For example, if the input is of shape `(2, 3, 4)`, then the output is also `(2, 3, 4)`, while the label is of shape `(2, 3)`, as `4` here means 4 categories. This is also what the current `infer_shape` says.\n\nHowever, if I understand correctly, it seems that modification is forcing the first dimension to be _number of samples_ and everything else is collapsed as categories. Is this intended behavior that is needed in some specific application? If it is, I guess we need to use a switch as we need the original behavior to properly support time-major

is a major refactor of src/kvstore, we should obtain multiple confirmations from users before merging.\n## performance improvement\n\nwill try to use gpu pear-to-pear communication if available for `kvstore=device`. together with PR #3238 , it potentially improves the performance using >=4 gpus training, or training multiple jobs at the same time. for example, using 8 m40, we can improve resnet 152 layers from 300 img/sec to 353 img/sec. even larger improvement is from distributed training. \n\nwe also provide tools in `tools/bandwidth` to measure the GPU bandwidth for various neural networks and hardwares. \n## changes for the interface\n1. new kvstore types `dist_sync_device` and `dist_async_device` for using GPU p2p communication in distributed training.\n2. which type kvstore will be created? (no different to current naming convention) \n   - if `\"device\" in name`, then will use GPU p2p for push and pull. otherwise all data go to cpu memory directly. \n   - if `\"dist\" in name`, use distributed kvstore. \n     - if \"async\" in name, use async communication; otherwise use synced communication\n3. the optimizer added into kvstore will run on GPUs when `kvstore=device`. previous we will copy data to cpu first. so the new way may accelerate things, but require the optimizer to be able to run GPUs\n\n~~4. the function `_create_kvstore` in `model.py` always returns `update_on_kvstore=True` to simplify things. we can further remove all logic related to `update_on_kvstore`.~~ \n## further things\n\nwe can use unified memory to solve #2919 we only need to\n- remove some context checks\n- remove the gpu buffer, do elementwisesum on ndarray from different gpus directly  \n\nbut i observed decreased performance on using unified memory. so we probably only enable it for very large arrays, e.g. fullc weight in vgg.

people are asking (#3142) how to use the new RNN symbol in mxnet, we provide this simple example as a demo. More importantly, this allow us to identify the use cases and issues we need to address. Currently we only have a wrapper to cuDNN RNN cell, so it is not available for CPU mode. Also we are working to stabilize the interfaces, as you can see from the comments of the demo, there are still many workarounds need to be applied to be able to work nicely with the rest of the mxnet high level APIs.\n\n@sbodenstein @antinucleon One important issue I need to mention is that currently the LSTM cell takes all the parameters as a concatenated big vector. This is not compatible with our initializer architecture. \n\nI only verified it is able to run and the perplexity is decreasing. But I did not compare with our old LSTM implementation

@antinucleon @tornadomeet \nCurrent master doesn't set gamma to 1 during testing, in order to accommodate old models introduced before fix_gamma was introduced and set to true by default.\n\nHowever this creates another problem as kvstore_local keeps a internal copy of all the weights so resetting to 1 inside bn is ignored and overwritten by kv's internal copy. As a result weight decay decreases gamma to 0 during training.\n\nThis PR fix this by resetting gamma whenever BN::Forward/Backward is called. However this invalidates all models trained before Dec 5 2015.\n\nMy suggestion is to merge this when we release 1.0 and explain this to the users in transition guide as well as provide a converter that set fix_gamma to false in .json symbols.\n","created_at":"2016-08-16T10:56:09Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T04:05:45Z","closed_at":"2016-08-17T04:05:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed44fd616c122c5e619f4edd7618551c17056559","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f486072da0670bcb31953ca6fd3baed64962cc36","head":{"label":"piiswrong:master","ref":"master","sha":"f486072da0670bcb31953ca6fd3baed64962cc36","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44707337,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcwNzMzNw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"piiswrong/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong/mxnet","description":"Efficient
