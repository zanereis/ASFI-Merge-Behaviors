issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

for the python one I spent some time figured out the `serialized_fn` is base64 encoded  of   zlib compressed  of a pickle serialized object code of the python function, and Java version's serialized_fn is using another way of serialization of a function (looks like snappy compression of java byte code?),\r\n    so the question is here: does this mean the `properties` is complete up to SDK Writers? if somebody is going to do Go or NodeJS, since different language has very different way of serialization of a function's code; all these will look like duplicating a lot of effort, then BEAM-14 could be a better approach?\r\n    but generally, could you share more necessary documentation for SDK writters? so far I feel these are necessary: **1) define a function serialization protocol, to be used in the `steps / properties`** **2) a language specific docker image, to be used as `workerHarnessContainerImage`, this image will need to interpret the serialization protocol from `steps / properties`**\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"kind\": \"ParallelDo\",\r\n      \"name\": \"s2\",\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"serialized_fn\": {\r\n          \"value\": \"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\",\r\n          \"@type\": \"http://schema.org/Text\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"display_data\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"value\": {\r\n              \"@type\": \"http://schema.org/Text\",\r\n              \"value\": \"__main__.WordExtractingDoFn\"\r\n            },\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. I see the Python API uses a lot of operator overloading like `|` and `>>`, but is that a very thoughtful decision, for reading input to use `p | 'label' >> beam.ReadFrom...()` I don't feel very intuitive, why not use `<<` to mean read from ? are there any good writtings from engineers behind?\r\n     it's similar for other languages which have many other kinds of syntax sugar, will be more interesting if can program in other languages than Java or Python; but will it become true? or will google will dedicate some more effort? or answer is **never**; could you do first fill parity from Python to have all features of Java API? the missing feature of triggers is an important one\r\n\r\nI don't see BigData processing area (Streaming or Batch, the competence lead by Spark vs. Apex vs. Flink vs. Gearpump vs. DataFlow) for any other programming language than Java is mature so far, to do any serious work on BigData processing, I feel choices are still limited to Java only, at least for this year 2017. would you say more programming language can do BigData, more SDKs coming next

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Wrap `FileSystems.delete` to do file cleanup in integration tests.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExtension to compute approximate statistics with the use of probabilistic data structure, or sketches.\r\n\r\nFor now, 4 sketches are supported :\r\n- HyperLogLog (ApproximateDistinct) for stream's cardinality\r\n- Count-min Sketch (SketchFrequencies) for computing frequency by element\r\n- Stream Summary (KMostFrequent) for computing a top k of most frequent elements\r\n- T-Digest (TDigestQuantiles) for computing quantiles in the stream\r\n\r\nThe sketches are implemented as Beam Combiners, allowing a user to build the sketch dynamically in the Pipeline and then make some dynamic queries and/or store it in a database.\r\n

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh PTAL\r\n\r\nThis is part 1 of many for the job submission API.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-01T23:18:23Z","updated_at":"2017-08-03T03:44:51Z","closed_at":"2017-08-03T03:44:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60f8bd1f4b967109d4dbf452c8b7035c8a536970","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/009e6ec204b6ff7cfabe8e480a831a0c5121b5eb","head":{"label":"robertwb:patch-10","ref":"patch-10","sha":"009e6ec204b6ff7cfabe8e480a831a0c5121b5eb","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-01T21:28:23Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T15:50:16Z","closed_at":"2017-08-02T18:49:11Z","merged_at":"2017-08-02T18:49:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"371a89ec7bdf4b92ebd7e346b376160253416a32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/371a89ec7bdf4b92ebd7e346b376160253416a32","head":{"label":"bjchambers:pbzip2-cherrypick","ref":"pbzip2-cherrypick","sha":"371a89ec7bdf4b92ebd7e346b376160253416a32","user":{"login":"bjchambers","id":35960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers","html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53010511,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzAxMDUxMQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"bjchambers/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bjchambers","id":35960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers","html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjchambers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bjchambers/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

BigQuery load jobs to be selected by the user even when using unbounded PCollections. If using unbounded PCollections, the user must specify a frequency indicating how often these load jobs will be generated.\r\n\r\nNote: while there are some similarities between the BigQuery transform and what is done in FileBasedSink, there are a enough differences that it does not appear easy or advisable to attempt to reuse the code.\r\n\r\nNote: a design choice is to only allow the user to specify a triggering frequency, not arbitrary windows. The reason is that this triggering frequency is merely a tuning parameter controlling the BigQuery load jobs and is usually set to keep the number of BQ load jobs under quota (ideally it wouldn't even be needed, however I don't know how to make this automatic and respect user quotas).

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Renames Source.getDefaultOutputCoder to Source.getOutputCoder (in a compatible way), to avoid the implication that it is optional: it is not optional.\r\n- Requires specifying a Coder on PCollection.createPrimitiveOutputInternal: as of this PR it can still be null (in which case coder will stay unset), but eventually it won't be\r\n- Removes all overrides of PTransform.getDefaultOutputCoder and deprecates it: instead, PTransform's should explicitly .setCoder() on their output collection\r\n\r\nThis PR is 3 boring, almost mechanical commits, each of which is large but should be individually easy to review.\r\n\r\nThe next step (in a separate PR) will be getting rid of .setCoder() calls in the SDK. Nearly all such calls are on results of ParDo.of() and MapElements.via() and such - I'll need to add optional .withOutputCoder() parameters to those transforms.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb \r\nCC:

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-26T00:07:19Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T23:13:37Z","closed_at":"2017-07-26T21:57:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a95235debf0f116a9d972498f1f9c988123906e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f371b51afd4ca506988e59a6e61816e71b65c85a","head":{"label":"robertwb:runner-api-combine","ref":"runner-api-combine","sha":"f371b51afd4ca506988e59a6e61816e71b65c85a","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-25T00:41:51Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T17:56:26Z","closed_at":"2017-07-26T17:56:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c00955dd7a6c6adf618bf732110d0f56901e048a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/3635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/3635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/210c857ea0859ab06c74d2ef6c9668567c000624","head":{"label":"robertwb:runner-api-read-good","ref":"runner-api-read-good","sha":"210c857ea0859ab06c74d2ef6c9668567c000624","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

is based on https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/3549 by @lgajowy, but it turned out that a lot more needs to be done to fix it properly, and the necessary changes require knowledge of sufficiently dark corners of the SDK and runners that asking an external contributor to do this is unfair, so I did the changes myself.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: callers of Source.getDefaultOutputCoder shouldn't require it to succeed.\r\n\r\nSource.getDefaultOutputCoder is only a hint for inferring the Coder of its elements, and it should not be required to succeed.\r\n\r\nE.g. when a runner is replacing a Read.from(source) transform, and the override needs to know a coder for elements of the source, if the source doesn't provide a coder, the user may have set a coder on the returned PCollection explicitly. In this case, the runner should use that coder.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, when an API uses a Source and needs its coder, it must let the caller provide a Coder explicitly (e.g. SourceTestUtils).\r\n\r\nI am treating this as a backwards-compatible change because Source.getDefaultOutputCoder() is a runner-facing rather than user-facing API. From the point of view of a user implementing a Source, adding a throws to the base class method signature is compatible.\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh \r\nCC:

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis change reduces duplication in the ValidatesRunner tests and avoids the proliferation of additional files in favor of the

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@kennknowles  @peihe  Could you please help to review the implementation of JStorm runner? \r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- There are still two test suites which were failed(CountingSourceTest, GenerateSequenceTest).

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

asks for controlling batch size using the `PubsubIO.Write.Builder`\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Two values configurable through the `PubsubIO.Write.Builder`:\r\n- `maxBatchSize` - controls the bulk batch request size\r\n- `maxBatchByteSize` - controls the bulk batch bytes request size\r\n\r\nIn this PR I have also made a modification to the `PubsubIO.Write.PubsubBoundedWriter`. Now the writer will dynamically track the number of bytes allocated for all messages. If the number of bytes exceeds the threshold it will publish before adding more messages.\r\n\r\nIf the message size exceeds the `maxBatchByteSize` then an exception will be thrown\r\n\r\nAn example use case of the new parameter is:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPubsubIO.writeMessages()\r\n    .withMaxBatchSize(100)\r\n    .withMaxBatchByteSize(100000)\r\n

of an exactly-once sink for Kafka, making use of transactions added in Kafka 0.11. This requires exact-once semantics for runners similar to Dataflow. \r\n\r\nMarking it a as WIP for now since there are a few more TODOs to address (runtime compatibility checks for runners / Kafka version, more tests, etc).\r\n\r\nThe implementation is described in a comment in the code : \r\n\r\n    // Dataflow ensures at-least once processing for side effects like sinks. In order to provide\r\n    // exactly-once semantics, a sink needs to be idempotent or it should avoid writing records\r\n    // that have already been written. This snk does the latter. All the the records are ordered\r\n    // across a fixed number of shards and records in each shard are written in order. It drops\r\n    // any records that are already written and buffers those arriving out of order.\r\n    //\r\n    // Exactly once sink involves two shuffles of the records:\r\n    //    A : Assign a shard ---> B : Assign sequential ID ---> C : Write to Kafka in order\r\n    //\r\n    // Processing guarantees also require deterministic processing within user transforms.\r\n    // Here, that requires order of the records committed to Kafka by C should not be affected by\r\n    // restarts in C and its upstream stages.\r\n    //\r\n    // A : Assigns a random shard for message. Note that there are no ordering guarantees for\r\n    //     writing user records to Kafka. User can still control partitioning among topic\r\n    //     partitions as with regular sink (of course, there are no ordering guarantees in\r\n    //     regular Kafka sink either).\r\n    // B : Assigns an id sequentially for each messages within a shard.\r\n    // C : Writes each shard to Kafka in sequential id order. In Dataflow, when C sees a record\r\n    //     and id, it implies that record and the associated id are checkpointed to persistent\r\n    //     storage and this record will always have same id, even in retries.\r\n    //     Exactly-once semantics are achieved by writing records in the strict order of\r\n    //     these checkpointed sequence ids.\r\n    //\r\n    // Parallelism for B and C is fixed to 'numShards', which defaults to number of partitions\r\n    // for the topic. A few reasons for that:\r\n    //  - B & C implement their functionality using per-key state. Shard id makes it independent\r\n    //    of cardinality of user key.\r\n    //  - We create one producer per shard, and its 'transactional id' is based on shard id. This\r\n    //    requires that number of shards to be finite. This also helps with batching. and avoids\r\n    //    initializing producers and transactions.\r\n    //  - Most importantly, each of sharded writers stores 'next message id' in partition\r\n    //    metadata, which is committed atomically with Kafka transactions. This is critical\r\n    //    to handle retries of C correctly. Initial testing showed number of shards could be\r\n    //    larger than number of partitions for the topic.\r\n    //\r\n    // Number of shards can change across multiple runs of a pipeline (job upgrade in Dataflow).\r\n

nodes have never had stable unique names in the original pipeline.\r\n\r\n - We have always mutated the pipeline before adding additional nodes so we got lucky. But as of #3334 we will no longer be mutating the original pipeline, so we need actual unique application names.\r\n - And, actually, current practice is that a runner may really mess with your pipeline, so (for example) you may have PCollections that no longer exist in the pipeline. Here, too, we got lucky.\r\n\r\nSo I think correct approaches include:\r\n\r\n1. Making each call to `assertReadingCompressedFileMatchesExpected` use a separate pipeline by making them each a separate test method.\r\n2. Move the call to `run()` into the test method, thus running it only once. To get stable unique names we could make the assertion stuff a composite so we could label the node, or just use an arbitrary uniquifier.\r\n\r\nI had already implemented the hack of just incrementing a counter to get #3334 to work. So, realizing the second incorrectness here, I just took the step of also moving the call to `run()` into the test method. This avoids exploding the number of pipelines that are run.\r\n\r\nR: @jkff

of http://s.apache.org/textio-sdf, based on http://s.apache.org/beam-watch-transform.\r\n\r\nThe `Match` transform can be useful for users who want to write their own file-based connectors, or for advanced use cases such as: watch for new subdirectories to appear in a directory (using `Match`), and then start watching each subdirectory for new files and reading them (using `TextIO.watchForNewFiles()`).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, finally makes it configurable whether `TextIO.read/readAll()` allow filepatterns matching no files, and adds a `FileSystems` utility for that.\r\n\r\nNormal reads disallow empty filepatterns (to preserve old behavior), `readAll()` allows them if the filepattern contains a wildcard (which seems a reasonable default behavior that read() should have had from the beginning, but we can't change it), and `watchForNewFiles()` allows them unconditionally (because files might appear later).\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\ncc @jasonkuster

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nInclude the Combine Payload in the Runner API Graph.\r\n\r\nAdd getCombineFn(AppliedPTransform) to extract the CombineFn from an\r\narbitrary transform.\r\n\r\nUpdate Pipeline Translation tests to include accumulator
