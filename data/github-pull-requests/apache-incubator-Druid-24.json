The streaming job's segment granularity must be equal to or finer than that of the concurrent replace job.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This can lead to incorrect final timestamp when calculated using intermediate offsets landing in DST transition, for e.g. `+21D` arrived at using `+14D` and `+7D` offset, where `+14D` lands in DST transition period. Since `bucketStart` values are calculated using this library, this behaviour can lead to incorrect `bucketStart` times.  \r\n\r\nThis change combines intermediate offsets to create a single offset that is used for calculating the final bucketStart timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, when sampling streaming data, the sampler would wait `timeoutMs` for `numRows` to be returned. If the stream has less rows than `numRows`, the sampler would wait the full `timeoutMs` period. In some cases, initially connecting to a given stream to sample may take a considerable amount of time, but reading subsequent records thereafter is a much faster operation. For these cases, this PR adds a new sampler config property `readTimeoutMs`, which if specified, causes the sampler to return after this period of time if no further records are found between the last record found, or `timeoutMs`, whichever comes first.  The new `readTimeoutMs` is only applied once some records have been read from the stream during sampling. For example if a stream has only 1 record in it at a given time, and `timeoutMs` is configured as `15000` miliseconds and `readTimeoutMs` is configured as `2000` milliseconds while `numRows` is configured as `500`, then assuming the first record is read quickly, the sampler will return after roughly `2000` milliseconds, whereas previously it would have returned after the full `15000` millesecond `timeoutMs` config value.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`RowWalker` doesn't explicitly clean up the resources over the sequence that it acquires. Therefore, queries acquiring resources like the merge buffers fail to clean up the resources after they are done with it. This PR refactors the code to clean up the result sequences when materializing the results as Frames. \r\n\r\nThe original PR that added this feature had a failing test that we ignored for the time being since we weren't seeing it in testing, and assumed that it might have been an issue with the `TestBuffers` class, however after facing this again, and investigating it uncovered the reason why the resources weren't getting cleaned up. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist below are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

(#14978)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 4f498e64691ecd22eaa2c940d1d0d57e769ee9e7.\r\n\r\nThe commit was creating an issue with the rule `CoreRules.JOIN_EXTRACT_FILTER`, The Introduction of this rule caused cases with non-equijoin to get into a situation where Calcite was not able to decipher rule dependencies correctly as the outputs might be slightly differing from one another. This would cause planning to throw an OOM at the broker. We are reverting this for now to unblock the master. An example case is\r\n```\r\nEXPLAIN PLAN FOR\r\nselect t1.s_int, t1.c \r\nfrom \r\n  (select * from test_unnest_test_sql_array CROSS JOIN unnest(a_int) as u(c)) t1 \r\ninner join \r\n  (select * from test_unnest_test_sql_array CROSS JOIN unnest(a_int) as u(c)) t2\r\non t1.c=cast(t2.s_int as char) \r\nwhere t1.s_int in (0, 1, 2, 999) and t2.s_int in (0, 1, 2, 999)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill add unit test cases to catch issues after adding the Join_extract_filter_rule in a followup\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug where segments can be committed for intervals for which only revoked locks are held.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thus, it is hard to know that the query performance suffers from the contention for shared merge buffer pools. We did meet such performance degradation issue in the production environment. \r\n\r\nThis PR exposed the count of waiting queries (threads) blocking at in the merge buffers pools. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable?

User can add this monitor to the configuration file such as `druid.monitoring.monitors=[\"org.apache.druid.java.util.metrics.MergeBufferPoolMonitor\", ...]`\r\n- Unit test is added. This unit test validated the `MergeBufferPoolMonitor` would emit correct count of pending queries with a query blocking at the `DefaultBlockingPool` by taking more than the number of available buffers in the `DefaultBlockingPool`\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNEW: You can now add a metric `mergeBuffer\\pendingRequests` to monitor the contention level of the merge buffer pool. This metric is exposed through the `QueryCountStatsMonitor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * You can monitor the number of pending queries at the merge buffer pool with the metric `mergeBuffer/pendingRequest`\r\n * Add the MergeBufferPoolMonitor to the configuration files of Broker, Historical or Router as `druid.monitoring.monitors=[\"org.apache.druid.java.util.metrics.MergeBufferPoolMonitor\", ...]`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

MSQ is unable to include realtime results from realtime queries. \r\n\r\nThis problem is present both in the controller, which only fetches metadata from the metadata store so that only published segments would be read and the worker, which reads segments from deep storage and lacks the ability to communicate with data servers.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add the capabilities to:\r\n- Fetch the realtime segment metadata from the coordinator server view,\r\n- Adds the ability for workers to query indexers, similar to how brokers do the same for native queries.\r\n\r\n**Release Notes**\r\n- Adds a context parameter `includeSegmentSource` which can be either `NONE`(default) or `REALTIME`. If this parameter is set to `REALTIME`, MSQ will include real time segments in the query results. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

The former refers to the connections per query that the broker can use to contact data nodes, whereas the latter refers to the number of threads in the broker reserved for serving the queries (which represents the correct figure). \r\n\r\nThis PR corrects that patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

retention rules are evaluated in the order in which they are set. Unfortunately, a mistake in the order of rules by an operator can lead to unintentional data loss, and if it goes unnoticed and auto-kill is enabled, data could be permanently deleted.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, a guard rail is added in the rules API. This guard rail aims to identify rules that fully contains the interval for any subsequent rules A rule is considered good as long as it will run at _some_ point (and doesn't fully hide other rules in the chain) - it's ensured by checking at the interval boundaries as well.\r\n\r\nSome examples of bad rules that will be disallowed (see unit tests for more examples):\r\n- [`loadByPeriod(P6M)`, `loadByPeriod(P3M)`]\r\n- [`loadByInterval(2020-01-01/2050-01-01)`, `loadByInterval(2021-01-01/2023-01-01)`]\r\n- [`dropBeforeByPeriod(P3M)`, `dropBeforeByPeriod(P6M)`]\r\n- [`loadForever`, `loadByPeriod(P1M)`]\r\n- [`loadForever`, `dropForever`]\r\n\r\nExamples of rules that will be allowed because they will be evaluated at _some_ point:\r\n- [`loadByPeriod(P5Y)`, `loadByInterval(2021-01-01/2023-01-01)`]; the loadByInterval rule will be evaluated at some point.\r\n-  [`loadByPeriod(P1Y)`, `loadByPeriod(P2Y)`]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes, if a user wants to intentionally set a rule that fully contains other rules, they can do it temporarily and then fetch the correct set of rules from the rules audit history after their testing is done.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

patch introduces \"processor managers\" to processor factories, as a replacement for the sequence of processors. Processor managers can use the results of earlier processors to influence the creation of later processors, which provides us with the building block we need to ensure that broadcast join data is only read once.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when broadcast join is happening, the `BaseFrameProcessorFactory` now uses a `ChainedProcessorManager` to first run `BroadcastJoinSegmentMapFnProcessor` (in a single thread), and *then* run all of the regular processors (possibly multithreaded).","created_at":"2023-09-18T19:22:28Z","updated_at":"2023-11-01T03:50:41Z","closed_at":"2023-10-04T06:17:00Z","merged_at":"2023-10-04T06:17:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ed4fd1ae3135e1dd39dabd8f9c7462f2a979d41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

PR #14322 , MSQ insert/Replace q's will wait for segment to be loaded on the historical's before finishing.\r\n\r\nThe patch introduces a bug where in the main thread had a thread.sleep() which could not be interuptted via the cancel calls from the overlord. \r\n\r\nThis new patch addressed that problem by moving the thread.sleep inside a thread of its own. Thus the main thread is now waiting on the future object of this execution. \r\n\r\nThe cancel call can now shutdown the executor service via another method thus unblocking the main thread to proceed. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ x been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFixes an issue where a race can cause a second attempt to publish segments for the same sequence.\r\nDuring the second publish, the segments have already been published and are no longer associated with the sequence.\r\nThis causes the tasks to fail with an error like:\r\n`org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: Attempting to publish with empty segment set, but total row count was not 0: [165263].`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n\r\nThe following sequence of events can cause the error\r\n\r\n1. Submit a publish request for all segments associated with sequence id x\r\n2. Iterate over the same sequence x in `maybePersistAndPublishSequences`\r\n3. The publish request in step 1 succeeds, and its callback to clear segments and other states associataed with sequence x.\r\n4. Since sequence x is no longer in the set of publishing segments, it is considered for publish again.\r\n5. No segments are associated with sequence x, and new data has been appended for sequence x + 1.\r\n6. Step 4 fails as the number of segment is 0, but the appenderator has non-zero rows, causing the above error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nWhen iterating over the sequences to check if they need to published, maintain a snapshot of the publishing sequences before iterating, so that a removal on successful publish doesn't cause the race to occur.\r\nTested on a local cluster by setting thread level breakpoints.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

enabled in the time chart\r\n - brush interval snaps to the selected time granularity\r\n - added a highlight bubble to all visualizations (except table because it has its

Description\r\n\r\n[Original proposal](https://github.com/abhishekagarwal87/druid/blob/metadata_design_proposal/design-proposal.md#3-proposed-solution-storing-segment-schema-in-metadata-store)\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nIn the current design, brokers query both data nodes and tasks to fetch the schema of the segments they serve. The table schema is then constructed by combining the schemas of all segments within a datasource. However, this approach leads to a high number of segment metadata queries during broker startup, resulting in slow startup times and various issues outlined in the design proposal. \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, we propose centralizing the table schema management process within the coordinator. This change is the first step in that direction. In the new arrangement, the coordinator will take on the responsibility of querying both data nodes and tasks to fetch segment schema and subsequently building the table schema. Brokers will now simply query the Coordinator to fetch table schema. Importantly, brokers will still retain the capability to build table schemas if the need arises, ensuring both flexibility and resilience. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Design \r\n\r\n### Coordinator changes \r\n\r\nThese changes enhance the coordinator's capabilities, enabling it to manage table schema and provide schema related information through its APIs. As of now, the segment metadata cache structure will be maintained on both leader and follower processes, this would help in leader failover scenario.\r\n\r\n**SegmentMetadataCache refactor**: We introduce a new class, `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache`, extending `AbstractSegmentMetadataCache` which manages the cache and forms the core of the schema management process.\r\nWe also add an implementation of `QuerySegmentWalker`, which is specific to segment metadata queries executed during segment refresh mechanism.\r\n\r\n**Changes to Coordinator timeline**: `CoordinatorServerView` has minor changes to register a timeline callback. This is required for CoordinatorSegmentMetadata to update its cache using the timeline. \r\n\r\n**API Changes**: \r\n- We introduce a new container class, `DataSourceInformation`, for handling `RowSignature` information. An API is exposed to retrieve datasource information, check `MetadataResource#getDataSourceInformation`.\r\n-- Request Path: `/druid/coordinator/v1/metadata/dataSourceInformation`\r\n-- HTTP Method: POST \r\n-- Request Body: Set of dataSource names \r\n-- Query params: No query params\r\n-- Response: List of `DataSourceInformation` object.\r\n\r\n- The existing api `MetadataResource#getAllUsedSegments`, responsible for returning used segments is modified (backward compatible though) to accept a new query parameter called `includeRealtimeSegments`. When set, this parameter will include realtime segments in the result. Additionally, we enhance the return object `SegmentStatusInCluster`, to provide additional information regarding `realtime` and `numRows`. \r\n-- Request Path: `/druid/coordinator/v1/metadata/segments`\r\n-- HTTP Method: GET\r\n-- Request Body: No changes \r\n-- Query params: Added new query parameter `includeRealtimeSegments`, when set returns realtime segments as well\r\n-- Response: `SegmentStatusInCluster` object has two new fields, `realtime` & `numRows`\r\n\r\n**Binding for Query Modules**: We add essential bindings to run segment metadata query in `CliCoordinator`.\r\n\r\n### Broker changes \r\n\r\nBroker now defaults to querying the Coordinator for fetching table schema, eliminating the need for querying data nodes and tasks for segment schema. Additionally, there are changes in the logic for building sys segments table.\r\n\r\n**Broker-side SegmentMetadataCache**: We introduce a new implementation of `AbstractSegmentMetadataCache` called `BrokerSegmentMetadataCache`. This implementation queries the coordinator for table schema and falls back to running a segment metadata query when needed. It also assumes the responsibility for building `PhysicalDataSourceMetadata`, for which a new class is introduced. \r\n\r\n**System schema changes**: In `MetadataSegmentView`, requests for realtime segments are now included when polling the coordinator. The segment table building logic is updated accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n* The changes have been tested locally with the wikipedia dataset. \r\n* Unit test has been added. \r\n* All of the existing integration tests have been tested with feature enabled (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14985/commits/39fb2484abde834498d924bbeb386c70c40eeb3b & https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14985/commits/eb3e3c1f0c6064aedddd5ddc92a8a37bd1420680 & https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14985/commits/30438f40e2bb24cca9264801a2730a29f9797e69).\r\n* Integration test with the group name `centralized-table-schema` has been added.\r\n* The changes have also been tested in a druid cluster with,\r\n    - 1 million segments, 225 datasources \r\n    - 3 master nodes\r\n    - 2 query nodes\r\n    - 150 data nodes \r\n\r\n    Notable observations, \r\n    * The memory usage on Broker was same as earlier. \r\n    * The memory usage on Coordinator increased a bit, with the new cache occupying 200 MBs on the Coordinator.  \r\n    * The cache initialisation time on the Coordinator varied around 8-12 minutes. Same as that for brokers with feature disabled. \r\n    * The cache initialisation time on the Broker was significantly reduced to 20 seconds.\r\n    * In the scenario of a Coordinator leader failover, brokers began polling datasource schema from the new leader. In this case, no segment metadata queries were executed by the Broker nodes.\r\n    * When Coordinator nodes were restarted, followed by Broker nodes, both services executed segment metadata queries to initialise the cache. However, after the Coordinator nodes completed the cache initialisation, brokers began fetching datasource schema from the Coordinator, rather than executing segment metadata queries.\r\n    * In the scenario of Broker nodes restarting followed by Coordinator nodes restarting, both services executed segment metadata queries. Once the cache on the Coordinator node was initialised, the Broker nodes began polling the datasource schema from the Coordinator instead of executing segment metadata queries.\r\n\r\n## Potential side effects \r\n* When the Druid cluster employs service tiering, it's possible for brokers in different tiers to generate different table schemas. This can lead to users observing varying table schemas on the web console, depending on which broker handles the query.\r\nWith this change, brokers will now poll the datasource schema from the coordinator, ensuring that all brokers consistently use the same datasource schema.\r\n\r\n## Known issues \r\n* The datasource schema can be partial, especially during service startup. Eventually, as all the segments for a datasource is refreshed the datasource schema would be accurate. This behaviour would happen irrespective of enabling the feature. \r\n* If the feature is enabled and a new datasource is added, both coordinator and broker might end up executing segment metadata queries to refresh the segment. \r\n\r\n## Upgrade considerations \r\nThe general upgrade order should be followed. The new code is behind a feature flag, so it is compatible with existing setups. Brokers with the new changes can communicate with old Coordinator without issues.\r\n\r\n## Release note\r\nThis feature is experimental and addresses multiple challenges outlined in the description. To enable it, set `druid.coordinator.centralizedTableSchema.enabled` in Coordinator configurations.\r\n\r\nAs part of enabling queries on the coordinator, following config classes are available with the specified base property names.\r\n\r\n`druid.coordinator.segmentMetadata` -> `SegmentMetadataQueryConfig`\r\n`druid.coordinator.internal.query.config` -> `InternalQueryConfig` \r\n`druid.coordinator.query.retryPolicy` -> `RetryQueryRunnerConfig`\r\n`druid.coordinator.query.scheduler` -> `QuerySchedulerProvider`\r\n`druid.coordinator.query.default` -> `DefaultQueryConfig`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\n(Note: The description might use union and union all interchangeably unless specified, both of which mean union all in SQL)\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the following:\r\n1. `UnionDataSource` can have data sources apart from the `TableDataSource`. This will be used for MSQ only, since MSQ, in theory, can plan arbitrary unions. Also, it is required to plan unions in MSQ in the DataSourcePlan.\r\n2. Disallow top-level union alls in MSQ. This is because the SQL layer executes the top-level unions sequentially, which doesn't make sense for an async engine like MSQ. More info and examples for this added later.\r\n3. Add the ability to plan a `UnionDataSource` in MSQ. This will provide MSQ feature parity with the native engine, as it will allow the \r\n4. (Will be broken into a separate PR) Add the ability to plan arbitrary data sources as unions (this will be an engine feature), however, this requires alignment as to what leeways are we willing to support - Do the unions with different column names get planned, do the unions with different types get planned, etc. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### 1\r\nMSQ needs to plan the individual data sources of the union and perform a replace operation so that each data source can be represented by the input specs that it requires. This warrants `UnionDataSource` to accept other data sources as its children. The current methods in the `UnionDataSource` have been refactored to perform the original checks only when the data source is used in certain contexts, like the native stack. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### 2\r\n\r\nMSQ currently doesn't support UNION queries. However, in the query stack, there are two types of UNIONs:\r\n1. UnionDataSource - Very limited. MSQ detects this and throws a `QueryNotSupported` fault, which is the expected behavior\r\n2. Top-level union - Works around the shortcomings of 1.\r\n\r\nHowever 2) is executed sequentially by the SQL layer and the results are appended sequentially. For a simple query like \r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM foo\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT * FROM foo2 \r\n```\r\nSQL would execute `SELECT * FROM foo` and `SELECT * FROM foo2` and concat the results together.\r\nThis works fine for working with engines producing results synchronously like `sql-native` where we return the results, however, for MSQ, which produces results asynchronously, the concatenation logic doesn't work as expected since don't wait for the query to finish, fetch the results and submit the second query.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the SQL layer submits the first query, gets the query ID back as the result, and then executes the second query (that fails). Therefore we only submit the partial query successfully and we might even get the incorrect results back.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the engine feature `ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_UNION_ALL` that dictates whether the planner can plan the query using top-level union alls. MSQ disallows this, so the queries are forced to plan using the union data source, which will return query not supported exception.\r\n\r\nThis flag will also be useful once we start supporting unions in MSQ, which we'd want to exclusively execute using `UnionDataSource`, and the flag would seamlessly tie in with the query paths we'd wanna take when planning unions then.\r\n\r\nWith the change, the following query:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"912\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 2 07 34 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/30999375/dc09b94f-a112-49b6-9c27-7811bc7a92b3\">\r\n\r\nnative tasks plan query as before (top-level union all)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"470\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 2 07 39 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/30999375/f598aff4-2a10-4b16-b227-3cb332660f59\">\r\n\r\n\r\nMSQ tasks plan can't plan query with top-level union all, therefore use the `UnionDataSource` to plan the query, which then ultimately fails with `QueryNotSupported` in MSQ \r\n\r\n<img width=\"384\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 2 07 48 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/30999375/145031d1-4961-41ad-9626-38523fcdacf9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### 3\r\nCheck out the changes in the `DataSourcePlan` which allows the union to be planned in the SQL stack\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### 4\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMSQ can execute UNION ALL queries with UnionDataSource.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

has previously refused to execute joins with non-equality-based conditions. This was well-intentioned: the idea was to push people to write their queries in a different, hopefully more performant way.\r\n\r\nBut as we're moving towards fuller SQL support, it makes more sense to allow these conditions to go through with the best plan we can come up with right now: a cross join followed by a filter. In some cases this will allow the query to run, and people will be happy with that. In other cases, it will run into resource limits during execution. But we should at least give the query a chance.\r\n\r\nThis patch also updates the documentation to explain how people can tell whether their queries are being planned this way.","created_at":"2023-09-13T20:31:47Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:46:19Z","closed_at":"2023-09-19T17:23:42Z","merged_at":"2023-09-19T17:23:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f498e64691ecd22eaa2c940d1d0d57e769ee9e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn the context of a DOAP RDF file, the `created` property typically refers to the date when the project was created. I just checked the first commit:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git show `git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD` -s --format=%cI\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n2012-10-23T12:08:07-07:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would be better to use `2012-10-23` instead of `2023-09-08` here.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen materializing the results as frames, we defer the creation of the frames in `ScanQueryQueryToolChest`, which passes through the catch-all block reserved for catching cases when we don't have the complete row signature in the query (and falls back to the old code). \r\nThis PR aims to resolve it by adding the frame generation code to the try-catch block we have at the outer

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\n\r\nAdding the optional 3rd argument replaceMissingValueWith to lookup extractor function that replaces the missing value from given lookups. Default value for replaceMissingValueWith is null. It is already supported in native layer. Just exposing this value to populated in SQL layer as well. On same line, updated the lookup macros to support replaceMissingValueWith. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nLookup function also accepts the 3rd argument called '$replaceMissingValueWith' as constant string, if you value is missing given lookups for queried key then lookup function return result value from replaceMissingValueWith eg:\r\n\r\nLOOKUP(store, 'store_to_country', 'NA')\r\n\r\nIf value is missing from store_to_country lookup for given key 'store' then it will return 'NA'.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFollow up to #14456, which in retrospect was a bit overly aggressive in removing the ability to serialize v4 of the nested column format in favor of always using the latest and greatest. This PR adds back the serializers, as well as introduces a system config to allow for more flexibility in what versions can be upgraded from.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* add back nested column v4 serializers\r\n* 'json' schema by default still uses the newer 'nested common format' used by 'auto', but now has an optional 'formatVersion' property which can be specified to override format versions on native ingest jobs\r\n* add system config to specify default column format stuff, 'druid.indexing.formats', and property 'druid.indexing.formats.nestedColumnFormatVersion' to specify system level preferred nested column format for friendly rolling upgrades from versions which do not support the newer 'nested common format' used by 'auto'\r\n\r\nI named `DefaultColumnFormatConfig` a bit generically because I was imagining putting other stuff on here in the future, like perhaps a way to control the default `MultiValueHandling` for classic multi-value string columns, or any other column format related stuff we might want to define defaults for that isn't really appropriate to define on the IndexSpec (which I still also intend to make a system level default for in the near future). I did consider adding this option to the `IndexSpec` instead, but it made sense to me to split them up since I didn't really want to wire the rest of the `IndexSpec` options up to things yet on a per column basis (that would be pretty cool though).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAdd system level runtime.properties option to specify default column format stuff, with prefix 'druid.indexing.formats', and property 'druid.indexing.formats.nestedColumnFormatVersion' to specify preferred nested column format for friendly rolling upgrades from Druid 25 to Druid 28.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Changes\r\n- Add new metric `kill/pendingSegments/count` with dimension `dataSource`\r\n- Add tests for `KillStalePendingSegments`\r\n- Reduce no-op logs that are currently spit out for each datasource even when no pending segments have been deleted. This can get particularly noisy at low values of `indexingPeriod`.\r\n- Refactor the code in `KillStalePendingSegments` for readability and add javadocs\r\n\r\n### Release Note\r\n- Add new metric `kill/pendingSegments/count` that reports the number of stale pending segments deleted from the metadata store for each datasource.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes an issue with complex type handling that was intended to be fixed as part of #12016 to handle cases where the broker is updated before historical and realtime nodes.\r\n\r\nSince complex types were sending back the response with just the complex type name, the valueType was still null resulting in errors of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: Encountered null type for column [theta_user]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.schema.SegmentMetadataCache.lambda$buildDruidTable$13(SegmentMetadataCache.java:825) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, only the user who has submitted the async query has permission to interact with the status APIs for that async query. However, often we want an administrator to interact with these resources as well. \r\nDruid handles these with the `STATE` resource traditionally, and if the requesting user has necessary permissions on it as well, alternatively, they should be allowed to interact with the status APIs, irrespective of whether they are the submitter of the query. This PR adds the same behavior to these async API resources as well, as documented below:\r\n\r\n(Path is relative to `/druid/v2/sql/statements/`)\r\n\r\n| Method and Path  | Original Behavior | New Behaviour (In conjunction with the original behavior) |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| `GET /enabled` | Unguarded | Unguarded |\r\n| `POST /` | Doesn't matter since caller will be the submitter of the query | Doesn't matter since caller will be the submitter of the query |\r\n| `GET /{id}` | Original submitter can access the status | Original Behavior + Users with `READ` permissions on `STATE`  |\r\n| `GET /{id}/results` | Original submitter can access the results | Original Behavior + Users with `READ` permissions on `STATE` |\r\n| `DELETE /{id}` | Original submitter can cancel the query | Original Behavior + Users with `WRITE` permissions on `STATE` | \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

for unnest, the not filter on the unnested column was being converted to a not on the input column and pushed down to the base data source. This created incorrect results when used on multi-value dimensions\r\n\r\nConsider this query\r\n```\r\n\"SELECT d3 FROM\\n\"\r\n        + \"  (select * from druid.numfoo where dim2='a') as t,\\n\"\r\n        + \"  UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dim3)) as unnested (d3)\\n\"\r\n        + \"WHERE t.dim1 <> 'foo'\\n\"\r\n        + \"AND unnested.d3 <> 'b'\",\r\n```\r\n        \r\nCurrently, we are pushing dim3 <> 'b' into the base (as d3 has a direct mapping to dim3) which is removing the entire row. For example,\r\n```\r\nselect dim3 from numFoo where dim2='a' AND dim1 <> 'foo'\r\n\r\ndim3\r\n----------\r\n[\"a\",\"b\"]\r\nempty\r\n```\r\nIf dim3 <> ‘b' is added to it the first row is eaten up. \r\n\r\n```\r\nselect dim3 from numFoo where dim2='a' AND dim1 <> 'foo' AND dim3 <> 'b'\r\n\r\ndim3\r\n------\r\nempty\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect as the user would have wanted to see 'a’ in the result.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional removal of Prometheus PushGateway metrics after the Prometheus emitter shutdown. The rationale for this change is that the PushGateway will remember all of the pushed metrics even if the batch job was finished a long time ago. This caused an issue with one of our clients as the PushGateway stored too many stale time series, that were already ingested by Prometheus. \r\n\r\nWe fix this issue within this repository https://github.com/deep-bi/druid-prometheus-emitter and we want to merge our fix with the Druid source code.\r\n\r\nThis PR only modifies the code of the Prometheus emitter extension. We extend a configuration with one more property and we add this information to the extension README.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from a brief mention for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDruid operators can specify optional prometheus emitter configs to delete metrics from the push gateway on task shutdown when the `pushgateway` strategy is configured:\r\n1. `druid.emitter.prometheus.deletePushGatewayMetricsOnShutdown`: When set to true, the peon tasks deletes metrics from the prometheus push gateway on task shutdown. Default value is false.\r\n2. `druid.emitter.prometheus.waitForShutdownDelay`: Time in milliseconds to wait for peon tasks to delete metrics from the Pushgateway on shutdown (e.g. 60_000). Applicable only when `druid.emitter.prometheus.deletePushGatewayMetricsOnShutdown` is set to true. Default value is none - i.e., there is no delay between peon task shutdown and metrics deletion from the push gateway.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `PrometheusEmitter`\r\n * `PrometheusEmitterConfig`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nI was trying to use existing `fillCapacity` select worker strategy in an effort to implement MiddleManager autoscaling, but since MM instances that I use are created by k8s statefulsets it wasn't consistent enough. Proposed strategy fills capacity based on worker's hostname, with assumption that host is k8s FQDN - eg. `druid-middlemanager-0.druid-middlemanager.druid-test.svc.cluster.local:8091`.\r\n\r\nSimilar problem was discussed in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8801.\r\nI'm not sure if this feature is desirable and this is my first java admission, so I'll take every bit of critique here. I can add tests if it will appear that this feature might be useful and we want to add it to codebase.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `FillIncrementallyWorkerSelectStrategy`\r\n * `FillIncrementallyWithAffinityWorkerSelectStrategy`\r\n * `FillIncrementallyWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nBuilding a `ServiceMetricEvent` using a `ServiceMetricEvent.Builder` is a little confusing right now because we need to chain two `build()` calls to get the final `ServiceMetricEvent`. This is because the `ServiceMetricEvent.Builder` is a builder of a builder.\r\n\r\n#### Existing\r\n```java\r\nServiceMetricEvent event\r\n  = ServiceMetricEvent.builder()\r\n                      .setDimension(\"dataSource\", \"wiki\")\r\n                      .setDimension(\"tier\", \"cold\")\r\n                      .build(\"segment/unavailable/count\", 100)\r\n                      .build(serviceDimensions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Proposed\r\n```java\r\nServiceMetricEvent event\r\n  = ServiceMetricEvent.builder()\r\n                      .setDimension(\"dataSource\", \"wiki\")\r\n                      .setDimension(\"tier\", \"cold\")\r\n                      .setMetric(\"segment/unavailable/count\", 100)\r\n                      .build(serviceDimensions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Make `ServiceMetricEvent.Builder` extend `ServiceEventBuilder<ServiceMetricEvent>` and thus convert it to a plain builder rather than a builder of builder.\r\n- Add methods `setCreatedTime` , `setMetric` to the builder\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test

This config is not needed in other duties and initializing it creates logs which are misleading.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Changes\r\n\r\n#### Remove config `decommissioningMaxPercentOfMaxSegmentsToMove`\r\n- It is a complicated config 😅 , \r\n- It is always desirable to prioritize move from decommissioning servers so that they can be terminated quickly, so this should always be 100%\r\n- It is already handled by `smartSegmentLoading` (enabled by default)\r\n\r\n#### Remove config `maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad`\r\nThis was added in #11135 to address two requirements:\r\n- Prevent coordinator runs from getting stuck assigning too many segments to historicals\r\n- Prevent load of replicas from competing with load of unavailable segments\r\n\r\nBoth of these requirements are now already met thanks to:\r\n- Round-robin segment assignment: This ensures that asssignments in a single coordinator run happen very fast\r\n- Prioritization in the new coordinator: Load of unavailable segments is always prioritized over load of under-replicated segment\r\n- Modifications to `replicationThrottleLimit`: The `replicationThrottleLimit` now ensures that for any tier, the sum of the number of replicas in load queue at start of a coordinator run and the number of replicas assigned during the run is always within the limit. So, it can perform the same function as `maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad` except `replicationThrottleLimit` is per tier.\r\n- `smartSegmentLoading` (enabled by default) takes care of all of the above without requiring the user to change any config\r\n\r\n### Pending\r\n\r\n- Cluster testing\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nRemove deprecated coordinator dynamic configs:\r\n- `decommissioningMaxPercentOfMaxSegmentsToMove`\r\n- `maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad`\r\nThese configs are not needed anymore as `smartSegmentLoading` automatically ensures the optimal behaviour in the underlying scenarios.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid
