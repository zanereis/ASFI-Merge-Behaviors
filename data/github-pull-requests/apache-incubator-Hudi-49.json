Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves usability of upgrade/downgrade commands in Hudi CLI by the following:\r\n- For the upgrade command (`upgrade table`), if `--toVersion` is not specified, the current/latest table version is used.\r\n- Adds support for numeric table version.  If the numeric table version is provided through `--toVersion`, it is converted to the `HoodieTableVersion` enum name internally, e.g., `2` -> `TWO`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new tests for the conversion of the input version option to the desired version name.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOnly affecting the upgrade and downgrade commands in Hudi CLI.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\nTested the following CLI commands and they all work as expected:\r\n- `upgrade table --sparkMaster local[2]`: `Hoodie table upgraded/downgraded to FIVE`\r\n- `downgrade table --toVersion 2 --sparkMaster local[2]`: `Hoodie table upgraded/downgraded to TWO`\r\n- `upgrade table --toVersion FIVE --sparkMaster local[2]`: `Hoodie table upgraded/downgraded to FIVE`\r\n- `downgrade table --toVersion TWO --sparkMaster local[2]`: `Hoodie table upgraded/downgraded to TWO`\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the table upgrade from version THREE to FOUR using Hudi CLI.  Before this fix, the following exception is thrown.  This is due to the missing `hoodie.table.name` property in the write config passed in.\r\n\r\n```\r\n22/08/11 15:35:39 INFO UpgradeDowngrade: Attempting to move table from version THREE to FIVE\r\n22/08/11 15:35:39 WARN SparkMain: Failed: Could not upgrade/downgrade table at \"/<>/test_table\" to version \"FIVE\".\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: hoodie.table.name property needs to be specified\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.common.table.HoodieTableConfig.generateChecksum(HoodieTableConfig.java:437)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.table.upgrade.ThreeToFourUpgradeHandler.upgrade(ThreeToFourUpgradeHandler.java:43)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.table.upgrade.UpgradeDowngrade.upgrade(UpgradeDowngrade.java:147)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.table.upgrade.UpgradeDowngrade.run(UpgradeDowngrade.java:118)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.cli.commands.SparkMain.upgradeOrDowngradeTable(SparkMain.java:520)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.cli.commands.SparkMain.main(SparkMain.java:271)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n- Adds the logic in CLI class `SparkMain` to add the `hoodie.table.name` property to the write config passed to the `UpgradeDowngrade`.\r\n- Adds unit tests to cover all supported upgrade and downgrade cases.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOnly affecting the upgrade and downgrade commands in Hudi CLI.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n- Before this change, the newly added tests for upgrading the table from TWO to FIVE fails.  After this change, all tests pass.\r\n- Runs hudi-cli on a local table.  Both upgrade and downgrade commands work.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `HoodieParquetReader` is not specifying projected schema properly when reading Parquet files which ends up failing in cases when the provided schema is not equal to the schema of the file being read (even though it might be a proper projection, ie subset of it), like in common CDC case when column is being dropped from the RDS and the schema of the new batch is lacking the old column.\r\n\r\nTo address the original issue described in HUDI-4588, we also have to relax the constraints imposed by `TableSchemaResolver.isSchemaCompatible` method not allowing columns to be evolved by the way of dropping columns.\r\n\r\nAfter addressing the original problem a considerable amount of new issues have been discovered including following:\r\n\r\n - Writer's schemas were deduced differently for different flows (for ex, Bulk Insert vs other ops)\r\n - Writer's schema was not reconciled against table's schemas in terms of nullability (this is asserted w/in `AvroSchemaConverter`, that is now invoked as part of the projection)\r\n - (After enabling schema validations) Incorrect schema handling w/in `HoodieWriteHandle` has been detected (there were 2 ambiguous schema references, set incorrectly, creating confusion)\r\n - (After enabling schema validations) Incorrect schema handling w/in `MergeHelper` impls, where writer's schema was used as a existing file's reader-schema (failing in cases when these 2 diverge)\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n1. Adding missing schema projection when reading Parquet file (using `AvroParquetReader`)\r\n2. Relaxing schema evolution constraints to allow columns to be dropped\r\n3. Revisiting schema reconciliation logic to make sure it's coherent\r\n4. Streamlining schema handling in `HoodieSparkSqlWriter` to make sure it's uniform for all operations (it isn't applied properly for Bulk-insert at the moment)\r\n5. Added comprehensive test for Basic Schema Evolution (columns being added, dropped)\r\n6. Fixing `HoodieWriteHandle` impls to properly handle writer schema and avoid duplication\r\n7. Fixing `MergeHelper` impls to properly handle schema evolution\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**High**\r\n\r\nThere are a few critical changes taken forward by this PR:\r\n\r\nNow, w/ incoming batches being able to drop columns (relative to the Table's existing schema), unless `hoodie.datasource.write.reconcile.schema` is enabled:\r\n\r\n - Incoming batch's schema will be taken as Writer's schema (same as before)\r\n - New/updated base files will be (re)written in the new schema (previously it would have failed)\r\n\r\nThis subtle change in behavior (dropped columns would not be leading to failures anymore) could open up a new set of problems where data quality issues (for ex, column is missing while it shouldn't) could trickle down into existing table.\r\n\r\nTo alleviate that we should consider flipping `hoodie.datasource.write.reconcile.schema` to `true` by default (there's already [#6196](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6196#issuecomment-1224476707) for that)\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`SQLConf` by default isn't propagated to Executors from the Driver. This is the reason why configuration specified w/ `--conf` is not being respected by some components being invoked on the executor (see https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6278)\r\n\r\nIn Spark this has been remediated by the introduction of `SQLExecutionRDD` that does snapshot `SQLConf` subsequently overriding it on the Executor side. However this has following limitations:\r\n\r\n1. `SQLExecutionRDD` does propagate `SQLConf` only for RDDs that are **preceding** it (ie its dependencies), and doesn't for the ones that are chained after it.\r\n2. `SQLExecutionRDD` is only applicable to `RDD[InternalRow]` \r\n\r\nTo work around #2 we're introduced `SQLConfInjectingRDD` (which is just a generalization of `SQLExecutionRDD`) and make sure that it's properly injected (to address #1) inside, for ex, `HoodieSparkUtils.createRdd` invocation (that is being carried out on the Executor side)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Shade `metrics-core` in `hudi-aws-bundle`\r\n- Remove duplicate includes in other bundles\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWithout this change, if Hudi metrics is turned on and metrics report type is Cloudwatch, then write client initialization fails. Stacktrace in HUDI-4568. The reason is that `metrics-core` is shaded in hudi-spark-bundle but not in hudi-aws-bundle but this dependency is used in hudi-aws for which we get NoMethodFoundError.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\nHigh\r\n\r\nRun below script (with metrics and hive turned on).

   \r\n    when we incremental query a hudi table, if\r\n//   1. there are files in metadata be deleted;\r\n//   2. read from earliest\r\n//   3. the start commit is archived\r\n//   4. the end commit is archived\r\nthis query will turns to a fullTableScan.\r\n     In this condition, the _endInstant_ parameter in getInputSplits() will be the latest \r\ninstance, cause to scan the latest fileSlice(which may be larger as time goes by) and then open it and filter the record using instantRange.\r\n     Considering a query scenario, read.start-commit is archived and read.end-commit is in activeTimeLine, this is a fullTableScan. But we can set the _endInstant_ parameter to read.end-commit, not the lastest instance, so as to read less data, more over, if there is an upsert between read.end-commit and the lastest instance, if we use lastest instance as _endInstant_, we will lose the insert data between read.start-commit and read.end-commit(the data is upserted, so the original data is missing in the lastest instance).\r\n    Considering another query scenario, read.start-commit is archived and read.end-commit is also archived, this is a fullTableScan. if read.end-commit is long along and be cleaned, but there is savepoint after it,  we can use this savepoint to incremental query the table, not care about the data inserted or upserted after the savepoint.\r\n    The core idea is making the searching fileSlice adjacent to read.end-commit.\r\nps.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIdeally, rollback is not triggered for completed instants. However, if it gets triggered due to some extraneous condition or forced while rollback strategy still configured to be marker-based, then fallback to listing-based rollback instead of failing.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - CTOR changes in rollback plan and action executors.\r\n  - Change in condition to determine whether to use marker-based rollback.\r\n  - Added UT to cover the scenario. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- When deltastreamer is used for writes and if upgrade is required, upgrade fails when there is a partially failed commit in timeline. bcoz, Deltastreamer calls startCommit() which internally rollsback the partially failed commit. Following this, writeClient.upsert is called, where in upgrade is triggered. In this code block of interest, we again try to check for partially failed commits and rollback them. but metaclient wasn't reloaded and hence we run into issues.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed upgrade to reload the metaclient. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without

`parallelism` and `total event number` in the bootstrap metadata event.\r\n- Use `parallelism` & `total event number` to determine whether or not to do the re-commit, rather than relying on the slot number (i.e., the current `write.tasks` setup).\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nUnit tests is added to verify the changes.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding
