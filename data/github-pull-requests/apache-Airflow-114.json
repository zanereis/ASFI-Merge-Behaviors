This reflected the time when we moved from Travis to GitHub Actions and we wanted to keep the possibility to support both. Those variables have been since removed, but there was that one single planet (err. script) where the remnant of the old Jedi order (err. variables) remained and they caused rather meaningless commit messages for constraints.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the commit messages to be more meaningful, including direct links to the action that updated the constraints and helpful description on how you can easily run breeze with the exact set of dependencies that were used for it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#29197\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the origin url for the Trigger DAG w/config web page, where currently, it redirects to the origin endpoint with the param dag_id, but for some origins, this lead to a error 400.\r\nFor example, when we navigate to the Trigger DAG w/config page from the endpoint tasks, the origin url will be `/tasks?dag_id=<dag_id>` without the `task_id`, the `execution_date` and the `map_index`, so when it redirect to this origin url, we get `Bad Request Invalid datetime: None`. To fix this problem, I redirect to the origin endpoint with all the origin params and I add `dag_id` if it doesn't exist in the origin params.","created_at":"2023-01-29T01:35:49Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T22:07:57Z","closed_at":"2023-01-29T08:56:35Z","merged_at":"2023-01-29T08:56:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"7315d6f38caa58e6b19054f3e8a20ed02df16a29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

recent postgres subchart upgrade had some issues: #29071\r\n\r\nThe biggest was the upgrade from PG 11 -> 15 resulted in the default `password_encryption` switching from `md5` to `scram-sha-256`. Simply moving back to 11 is the easiest remediation, and is acceptable since it is the oldest version Airflow supports (as of today in 2.5).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when updating the subchart, updating existing releases using built-in postgres was broken. As production use cases shouldn't be using built-in postgres, and it's easy to work around when hit, I've just documented the steps to proceed with the upgrade.\r\n\r\ncc @snjypl

support for `auth_type`'s which don't rely on user/password authentication. Currently `SimpleHttpOperator` only initializes the `auth_type` if login is present. But some implementations of `AuthBase`, such as Kerberos rely on different mechanism. In this case it was `HTTPSPNEGOAuth` from [requests_gssapi](https://pypi.org/project/requests-gssapi/) and `HTTPKerberosAuth` from [requests_kerberos](https://pypi.org/project/requests-kerberos/) which was not working because of that. This PR improves it, together with some tests demonstrating the behavior. Question - what would be the best way of including extra arguments to authorization?

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/28528 was merged, we respect the polling times instead of pinging the API constantly. This means that some tests that have sensors that used to wait for a very short time are now taking a lot longer because they wait for nothing.\r\n\r\nI went through the \"duration\" metric for system tests, and looked at the ones that had a noticeable increase in run time in the last runs, then adapted the poke intervals to adapt them to the actual waiting time.\r\n\r\nshorten sleep time on athena sys test. 2 minutes faster.\r\nset shorter polling times of fast ops in batch sys test - 4min faster\r\nshorter polling on cloudformation systest - 1min30s faster\r\nshorter polling time on lambda sys test - 1 min faster\r\nshorter wait on quicksight\r\nshorter waits for sagemaker test\r\nshorten wait time for setp_functions, 50s faster\r\nshorter wait on dms.

#28890 #29014\r\n\r\nIn version 2.3.1 of this provider, an fix was made to allow users to specify the entire tenant domain on their dbt Cloud instance rather than just the third-level (e.g. \"my-tenant.domain.com\" vs. \"my-tenant.getdbt.com\") via Connection.host. This was particular useful for other dbt Cloud regions other than the US. Backwards compat was still available via Connection.schema, but was noted as deprecated.  Given other changes are being made to the provider, Connection.schema use to specify the dbt Cloud tenant domain should be dropped.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was a recent enhancement of DbtCloudRunJobOperator to include deferrable/async functionality. Unfortunately the `tenant` evaluation in the DbtCloudHook was outdated and didn't include the most recent change to properly handle domain specification. This PR consolidates the tenant eval logic to a common method to be used by both sync and async methods in the hook.

#25734 \r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n`PATCH /api/v1/roles/[role]` previously would only ever append permissions to a role, never removing permissions that were omitted from the `PATCH` call. This makes it impossible to programmatically remove permissions from a role via the API.\r\n\r\nChange:\r\nThis change changes the behavior of the `PATCH` api for roles to allow for both adding and removing permissions based on which permissions are passed via the `PATCH` call.\r\n\r\nPermissions omitted from the API call are removed from the role. Permissions passed via the API call are added to the role.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis technically could be considered a breaking change. The way the `PATCH` endpoint is currently implemented is not how it _should_ work (based on how `PATCH` endpoints generally work) but users could have built their systems using this awkward behavior.","created_at":"2023-01-24T17:48:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T00:11:41Z","closed_at":"2023-04-11T00:11:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abbd30b08366e2bb4f75e6c63601907adeb3b678","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jhtimmins","id":4926004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhtimmins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Fix for using Airflow module on Windows Dask Worker\r\nIn the latest release of Airflow (tested with 2.5.1), task execution on a Dask Worker will fail on Windows due to the usage of an unknown attribute from the signal module.\r\n\r\nThe offending line is located in **airflow/jobs/local_task_job.py**\r\n```python\r\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGUSR2, sigusr2_debug_handler)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR we have not removed the line but simply put it in the scope of an IF condition that skips it if the constant **IS_WINDOWS** from **airflow.utils.platform** is True. This mitigates the issue and allows the Windows systems to be used as Dask Workers for Airflow.\r\n\r\nHaving Windows Workers for our Airflow Cluster is a very important use-case in our company, due to some legacy dependencies that still need to be supported. Others may find this useful, hence why we share this simple fix and propose to include the change that will have no effect on POSIX based

were a anumber of cases where the \"--help\" output of Breeze command had shown a bit inconsistent/incomplete output for rich-click generated help. The options are assigned to groups to make it easier to understand what those options do and to make it easier to digest, but the problem was that if you forgot to add an option to a group, it was added to \"common\" options and it was quite misleading.\r\n\r\nAlso some left-over options were left in the rich-click groups when the options have been removed. It had no visible effect, but they were polluting the code with inaccurate information.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all those cases in the past where it happened but also prevents the cases from happening in the future by adding a new (yes you guessed it) Breeze command that performs the check and fails in case any inconsistencies are found (with helpful messsage explaining the user what to do. This command is run as part of our CI so it will prevent similar problems from re-appearing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #11463 \r\n\r\n-->\r\nThis PR attempts to close a long open issue (closes: #11463 ) related to allowing Airflow to publish tags in a backward compatible manner.\r\n\r\nThe support for tags has been long-desired, and the recent PR #28961 introduced the **tags** parameter to the StatsLogger Protocol. However, this tag only allows us to introduce tags in a forward looking way: useful existing metrics that take form of concatenated tag-like attributes cannot meaningfully be changed to be efficiently aggregated. The following are some examples of metrics that would greatly benefit from having an updated naming/tagging convention as they hold an important significance at the cluster level:\r\n\r\n- dagrun.schedule_delay.<dag_id>\r\n- dagrun.<dag_id>.first_task_scheduling_delay\r\n\r\nI am introducing two additional parameters, along with one configuration property in order to enable a backward-compatible approach to introducing tags for tag-supported plugins (Datadog, Influxdb etc)\r\n\r\n### Parameters:\r\n\r\n- name_tags: OrderedDict[str, str]\r\n- stat_suffix: str\r\n\r\n**name_tags** are similar to the existing tags, except that they will be included into the end of the stat_name if **statsd_aggregation_optimized_naming_enabled** is set to False. This means that adding or changing name_tags will break backward compatibility. In contrast, the **tags** property will remain a non-breaking parameter that will allow us to introduce a breadth of tags to airflow.\r\n\r\n**stat_suffix** are added to the stat_name after the name_tags have been concatenated. We would prefer to not have this attribute as it seems extraneous, but it is necessary to maintain backward compatibility with some metrics that have included tag-like attributes in the middle of the metric name. (e.g. dagrun.<dag_id>.first_task_scheduling_delay).\r\n\r\n### Configuration Property\r\n\r\n- statsd_aggregation_optimized_naming_enabled: boolean = False\r\n\r\nWhen set to False (default), the current naming format is preserved. But when set to True, name_tags will be excluded from the stat_name for better aggregation. In our example, if dag_id is passed into the name_tags parameter as **OrderedDict({\"dag_id\": dag.dag_id})**, it will be excluded from the stat_name and instead be published as one of the tags to the metric. (The resulting stat_name will be dagrun.first_task_scheduling_delay, which allows us to aggregate the average of scheduling delays better).\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### EDIT:\r\n\r\nThis PR now publishes two separate stats metrics for some important existing metrics. A single scheduling delay event will now trigger the following two Stats.incr calls. The rationale for this change is discussed in the comments.\r\n\r\n```\r\nStats.timing(f\"dagrun.schedule_delay.{dag.dag_id}\", schedule_delay)\r\nStats.timing(f\"dagrun.schedule_delay\", schedule_delay, tags={\"dag\": dag.dag_id})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Change: InfluxDB support:\r\n\r\nInfluxDB-StatsD support is entirely _opt-in_, and is driven by a configuration property: **statsd_influxdb_enabled** which is set to False by default. When enabled, the tags will be added into the stats_name according to the influxdb-statsd convention in order to allow the publication of tagged metrics.\r\n\r\nI have currently made the change to **dagrun.schedule_delay.<dag_id>** or **dagrun.<dag_id>.first_task_scheduling_delay** to show how name_tags could be used to update the existing metrics in a backward-compatible way. If this sounds like a good idea, I could keep working on this PR to update other existing tags as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

were couple of problems with static checks generating source\r\nfiles including generated stubs in the common.sql package:\r\n\r\n* black formatting was implemented in multiple separate scripts\r\n  making it harded to fix problems in all of them\r\n* generated stub files were not formatted with is_pyi=True and\r\n  black had no way to figure it out because it was working on strings\r\n* black formatting was not consistently applied in all places\r\n* EOL at the end of generated stub file was missing, leading to EOL\r\n  fixer adding them after generation leading to multiple pre-commit\r\n  passes needed\r\n* there was (already unused) deprecated dev dict generator that used\r\n  its own black formatting.\r\n\r\nThere were also couple of problems with the files generated by\r\nstubgen itself:\r\n\r\n* Union was missing in the generated stubs (this is a known issue\r\n  with stubgen: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12929\r\n* Intellij complained on Incomplete import from _typeshed missing\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all the problems:\r\n\r\n* black formatting is now consistenly extracted and applied everywhere\r\n* when needed, is_pyi flag is passed to black so that it knows\r\n  that .pyi file is being fomratted\r\n* EOL is added at the end of file when the file is generated\r\n* Union is added to the generated stub\r\n* noqa is added to _typeshed import\r\n* the dict generator is removed\r\n\r\nAs the end result, generated stub files are fully importable\r\n(no errors reported by IntelliJ IDE) and consistently formatted\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you

in comments in the code, but there is a race condition when stopping a pipeline that can make the operation fail if it's in the middle of two steps.\r\nIt should be very rare in real life, but happens more often on our system tests, which run a dummy pipeline made of very short steps.\r\nBoto doesn't retry it because its retry strategy doesn't include either 409 HTTP codes nor ConflictExceptions,

better open Airflow RBAC to external integrations (see below), this change increases the maximum lengths of user identifies columns in `ab_user` and `ab_register_user` tables:\r\n- `first_name` and `last_name` from 64 to 256 characters.\r\n- `email` and `username` from 256 to 512 characters.\r\n \r\nWhile Airflow RBAC model is represented in the fixed set of Flask App Builder `ab_*` tables, it can be integrated with a variety of authentication mechanisms. They may operate on various forms of user identifiers that can be of various lengths. For example:\r\n- Display names like first and last name may not always be available, and some integrations may opt for defaulting those columns to the other identifiers, like username or email, which can be longer.\r\n- Identity federation is a scenario in which user identifiers can be particularly long, like this one from Google Cloud workload identity federation: `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/POOL_ID/subject/SUBJECT_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T13:41:09Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T22:07:05Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T12:54:31Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T12:54:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9877d90386b8a516f781b21bd03da4c35e9c76b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

PR addresses executor coupling **5a** and **5b** in Airflow CLI. See [this issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/27932) (#27932) for more context.\r\n\r\n## Please read before reviewing: \r\nChange summary:\r\n\r\n1. Updates to the executor interface (i.e. add stub methods to the base executor and the two hybrid executors which don't inherit directly from base) to vend cli commands and make small changes in the cli_parser.py module to read in commands from this new method. Add tests for the interface.\r\n\r\n 1. Move executor related cli commands (for Celery and Kubernetes) to their respective executor modules utilizing the new interface from step 2. All original tests for these CLI commands still apply.\r\n \r\n## NOTE\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, CLI commands will only be displayed for the **currently configured executor**. This solves some technical issues around parsing and import cycles, as well as finally puts to rest many strange behaviours people would have with using CLI commands for executors they do not have installed which often yielded broken behaviour due to missing dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

we assigned kerberos user name directly to the flask user,\r\nbut this had no chance to work because we expect FAB user there and\r\nour security code crash with 'str' has no attribute 'perms'.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses Kerberos username (including the Kerberos realm) to\r\nretrieve the user from the security manager. This means that\r\nthe user name has to have the form of `user_name@KERBEROS_REALM`.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we are not using email (despite similarities of\r\nthe realm and domain name is that those are often different. Email\r\ndomain names have often nothing to do the with the realms within\r\norganisations, and it seems safer to put fully qualified names\r\nincluding the realm in order to uniquely identify the users in\r\ncase the organisation uses more than one REALM.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/28919\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

my experience, it's currently hard to see exactly what error caused an example dag/system test to fail, because it doesn't stop right away, and teardown tasks can error as well, so it becomes an adventure up the logs to find the source of the problem.\r\nTo help with that, I propose adding a summary of the run at the end of the execution with the status of the tasks. it looks like this (in this case I ran the example_batch from aws system tests):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114772123/213582735-d026a29a-ea63-4845-ace1-d40a0c0b68a6.png)\r\nand in case of

info from the tasks. I added a little duration summary as well as a freebie.\r\n\r\nIt's going to be run at the end of every system test, so I guess it could be nice to get a review from some other providers who run their system tests as well
