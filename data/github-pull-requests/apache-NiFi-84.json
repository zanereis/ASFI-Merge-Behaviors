PR contains several feature enhancements:\r\n\r\n- Support of expression language within the specification\r\n- Support of expression language testing using Advanced UI with new Test Attributes dialog\r\n- Update of Jolt library to version 0.1\r\n- Added support for new [Modifier library (Jolt Beta functionality)](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/jolt/releases/tag/jolt-0.0.22)\r\n\r\nFor Testing:\r\n\r\nExpression language can now be referenced within a Jolt Specification. Expressions can be written on either side on the left hand side ( matching input json keys) or the right hand side (output of json data) of the specification. The Advanced UI can test expressions that reference attributes using the Attributes dialog which allows users to provide key/value pairs that will be resolved when testing a transformation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1552\" alt=\"joltspecel\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1371858/21375258/4e9f1878-c6fa-11e6-9a45-2213e6f42107.png\">\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1371858/21905371/2eff0964-d8d5-11e6-89de-263ded49a725.png)\r\n\r\nJolt 0.1 has added support for transformation of data within a given schema through the Modifier library. Modifier introduces more sophisticated data manipulation capabilities including for strings, lists, type conversion, etc.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1552\" alt=\"joltspec-modfiers\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1371858/21375249/4080ccb4-c6fa-11e6-8e34-c41c33644aa9.png\">\r\n\r\nBelow is an example chain specification that can be used against Twitter payload for testing.  When testing in the Advanced UI ensure that attributes referenced in expression language  are provided for testing (${rating.var} and ${id.var}) and that left side variable content match actual input (e.g. id.var should equal 'id' for twitter json to match). Custom attributes can also be configured with nifi to use this specification within an actual flow.\r\n`\r\n [{\r\n    \"operation\": \"shift\",\r\n    \"spec\": {\r\n      \"created_at\": \"created_date_time\",\r\n      \"id\": \"tweet_id\",\r\n      \"text\": \"tweet_text\",\r\n      \"user\": {\r\n        \"${id.var}\": \"user_id\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"operation\": \"default\",\r\n    \"spec\":{\r\n   \t\t\"user-rating\" : 4,\r\n        \"twitter-rating\" : \"${rating.var}\"\r\n \t}\r\n},{\r\n\t\"operation\": \"modify-default-beta\",\r\n\t\"spec\": {\r\n\t\t\"~in_reply_to_status_id\": 0,\r\n\t\"~in_reply_to_status_id_str\": 0,\r\n\t\"~in_reply_to_user_id\": \"\",\r\n\t\"~in_reply_to_user_id_str\": 0,\r\n\t\"~in_reply_to_screen_name\": \"\"\r\n\t}\r\n},{\r\n\t\"operation\": \"modify-define-beta\",\r\n\t\"spec\": {\r\n\t\t\"user_nearby_address\":\"na\"\r\n\t}\r\n},{\r\n\t\"operation\": \"modify-overwrite-beta\",\r\n\t\"spec\": {\r\n\t\t\"truncate\" : true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n]\r\n`\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

left the four commits to show the history of how this evolved. We can squash Bryan's two commits when merging, but we wanted Randy to get credit for starting the work on this ticket.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing #1320, I found few concerns as shown in the table below.\r\nLet's say there are `client.nifi` and `server.nifi` transferring files each other using S2S. This table shows how `s2s.address` attribute values are set in each case with #1320:\r\n\r\n| Transfer Protocol | Pulled from a remote OutputPort to S2S client | Received via an InputPort at S2S server |\r\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\r\n| RAW | Server's hostname and port are the one that the client gets when it received remote NiFi peers. Those values are defined in server's nifi.properties.  <br/> `nifi.remote.input.host:nifi.remote.input.socket.port` <br/> e.x. `server.nifi:8081` | Client's hostname and port is used. But due to the existing logic which parses URL string and extract hostname and port, if the URL string contains illegal character such as underscore, the result becomes null, then converted with `unknown`. This happens with Docker as container hostname often contain underscore. <br/> e.x. `client.nifi:58034`, `unknown:unknown` (if hostname contains underscore) <br/> **FIX 1** <br/> `client_nifi:58034` (even if hostname contains underscore)|\r\n| HTTP | Same as RAW protocol, but uses `nifi.web.http(s).port`. <br/> e.x. `server.nifi:8080`| Client hostname and port are retrieved from HTTP request object.  However, it returns IP address string representation instead of hostname. Probably performance reason. <br/> e.x. `192.168.0.33:59946` <br/> **FIX 2** <br/> `client.nifi:59946`.|\r\n\r\n## FIX 1\r\n\r\nAs reporte in [the previous PR comment](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1307#issuecomment-266442657) I got 'unknown' hostname and port with Docker containers. While this can be handled as a corner case since it's not allowed by the URL specification, I think it'd be better if we can be lenient here to support Docker environment. I confirmed provenance event also failed to resolve hostname and produced provenance details with null hostname.\r\n\r\nThis can be improved by changing Peer's constructor. Currently, it parses peerUrl then use its hostname and port, but the same information should be retrieved from PeerDescriptor without parsing the URL. Also, SocketRemoteSiteListener uses server's hostname and port for PeerDescription, but it seems it's not correct, those should be client's.\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies SocketRemoteSiteListener to use PeerDescriptor instead of parsing URL string.\r\n\r\n## FIX 2\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies DataTransferResource to resolve hostname from IP address using InetAddress  when HTTP transport protocol is used, as RAW resolves hostname from socket, using

part of upgrading the AWS SDK, I ran the suite of AWS integration tests.  Getting the integration tests to succeed required a couple of changes detailed below, none of which I believe to be caused by the SDK change:\r\n\r\n* ITPutS3Object.testGetPropertyDescriptors - bumped up the expected number of Property Descriptors to match the actual number.\r\n* ~~ITPutS3Object.testContentType - Ignored. The test checks if the content type was written to the flowfile attributes after writing the content to S3.  I did not find any place in the PutS3Object code that attempts this, uses the S3_CONTENT_TYPE constant, or that was submitted with NIFI-2810.  I created a separate ticket to investigate, NIFI-3228.~~ (NIFI-3228 was fixed and merged, see rebase below)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a user of both NiFi and MiNiFi there are many times I would like to have an operational dashboard for MiNiFi. Although, there is a discussion and desire for Centralized management there are many times where as a user I just want to be able to use the operational tools I already have. In many cases those may be products such as: Nagios, Zenoos, Zabix, Graphite, Grafana and in cloud environments perhaps Azure Application Insights and AWS Cloudwatch.\r\n\r\nThis  P/R provides a processor that ingests the MiNiFi Flow Status report and sends it to Azure Application Insights as custom metrics. This then allows a user to set alerts in Azure Application Insights, thus providing the ability to monitor MiNiFi agents. As such, this has a dependency on the following MiNiFi JIRA: Change FlowStatusReport to be JSON ([https://github.com/apache/nifi-minifi/pull/65](url))\r\n\r\nAn example flow of how to set this up for the MiNiFi side is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1100275/21208171/61891462-c23a-11e6-9075-e7657653f40f.png)\r\n\r\nAnd the NiFi Side looks like:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1100275/21208215/bc114cec-c23a-11e6-8393-ee2ec50e61e7.png)\r\n\r\nThen once this is all set in Azure Application Insights I can build a dashboard that may look like this:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1100275/21208329/67804e02-c23b-11e6-8e7d-933c56f33d3b.png)\r\n\r\nAnd explore all the various metrics, that I may want to build a dashboard from:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1100275/21208347/913e5b76-c23b-11e6-89b6-b8895210ffff.png)\r\n\r\nI can then also go and set alerts \r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1100275/21208458/128b653e-c23c-11e6-8737-d8665c280325.png)\r\n\r\nIn the end this type of integration can also be done with other enterprise
