I restricted support for only 'json-file' and 'gelf', since that is all I was able to test locally. I can include support for other logging drivers (e.g. fluentd) if it makes sense. Also, I wasn't sure if I should have a check in place for valid logging options. Happy to explore if it makes sense. Here is some info on the GELF logging driver and its options, https://docs.docker.com/engine/logging/drivers/gelf/. \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41067\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the tests in `tests/models/test_variable.py`in database isolation mode.\r\n\r\nThis was a bit harder one. It wa snot just fixing tests but to make the API working the same way like w/o DB isolation the following needed to be adjusted:\r\n- Cache need to be cleared on API client as well as server on update\r\n  - This means I needed to add a facade and make internal methods for the backend to ensure cache is flushed on client\r\n- KeyError and AttributeError are used by Variable API and need to be supported/transported by internal API w/o HTTP 500\r\n  - Serialization for the two Exceptions needed to be added as well\r\n- Some tests needed to be excluded because the distributed setup with

services except Redis, this PR results in no behavior change but allows users to configure `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` if they want.\r\n\r\nRedis is unusual in that the chart had an entry for `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` already with a default of 600. So it seems the author wanted Redis to have a grace period of 600 but actually was getting 30 since it wasn't properly configured. Therefore I properly added the `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` for Redis which will change the behavior from 30 seconds (since one wasn't provided) to 600. I could also change the default to 30 to maintain current behavior but my interpretation of the chart is that current behavior is a bug. A longer termination grace period seconds for Redis can make sense if you want to ensure you don't have data loss.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

change adds support for `mongodb+srv://` URIs when the MongoHook interprets the Connection parameters, while maintaining the existing option of an `srv` query parameter.\r\n\r\n#### Current Behavior\r\nIf you are:\r\n* using the MongoHook AND\r\n* using the [SRV/seed list feature](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format) in your MongoDB cluster AND\r\n* creating your Connection from a URI string starting with `mongodb+srv://`\r\n\r\nyou need to manually change your connection URI by adding a query parameter `srv=true` (the URI scheme is in fact ignored completely). \r\n\r\nIf you do not add the query param, the hook will munge the scheme to `mongodb://`, attempt to use the SRV locator as a direct service location, and fail to connect properly.\r\n\r\n#### New Behavior\r\nAfter this change:\r\n* Connections created with URIs beginning with `mongodb+srv://`, or with `conn_type=mongodb+srv`, will cause the MongoHook to interpret the connection as an SRV locator\r\n* `srv=true` forces SRV behavior, as before\r\n\r\nTests have been added to verify the new behavior with both `uri` and `conn_type` arguments.\r\n\r\n#### Justification\r\nMy organization uses the Mongo-supported form of `mongodb+srv://` which we get from the service vendor who hosts our MongoDB instances. (The introduction of SRV to Mongo was blogged [here](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/srv-connection-strings/)). \r\n\r\nThe lack of support for the standard URI scheme means that every time we add or change a MongoDB URL in our Airflow connections, the Ops team can't simply copy the URL from the service vendor to a config file or secret; they have to manually add the query param, or rope in the relevant dev team to do so (or worse, we all have to respond to a production failure and then decide under pressure who's going to modify the URL).\r\n\r\nMerging this change will make coordinating Mongo clients in our Airflow stack simpler and more

In MS Graph and PowerBI, the version is v1.0, while in Fabric it is v1.  So in order to be able to also invoke MS Fabric endpoints, we had to define the absolute URL instead of the relative one in order to make it work, as with relative url's we where unable to specify v1 as api_version.

The reason why I wanted to introduce this is because I experienced that the _insert_statement_format and _replace_statement_format string formatting properties in the `DbApiHook` are a bit of a naïve approach.  Yes, this approach is generic and doesn't ty the code to a specific database, hence why I want to introduce some kind of dialect, but it's also limited as the parameters passed to the string format are hard-coded and aren't always sufficient for certain databases.\r\n\r\nWe, for example are using MsSQL and SAP Hana a lot in our DAG's, and since we are using the `insert_rows` methods as much as possible for inserting/updating data, we liked the approach of the replace parameter which allows you to specify if you want to insert or replace data.  That way all our inserts/replace tasks in our DAG's are using the same generic code independently of which database we want to write to.  We also use the `GenericTransfer` operator across multiple databases that way which is great.  Beside that, we also implemented a custom `SQLInsertRowsOperator` which does the same as the GenericTransfer operator but then get's the data from an XCom instead of another database,  I'll also propose a PR for that once we have a good solution for the current problem we try to solve in this PR.\r\n\r\nSo the issue with the current approach for automatically generating the replace statement is when we want to use MsSQL.  For SAP Hana it was easy, we just had to override the `replace_statement_format` parameter in the connection extra field and we were done.  For MsSQL that was not possible, that's why I created another [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40836) that is already merged in Airflow for the `MsSqlHook`, in which I override the `_generate_insert_sql` method of the `DbApiHook` to allow a more complex replace statement generation to support the replace option.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that this functionality will only work when using the MsSQL connection type (which underneath uses the pymssql library).  Unfortunately, we experienced a lot of [connection issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19348255/pymssql-operationalerror-db-lib-error-message-20009-severity-9) and even deadlocks (later one is maybe unrelated) when writing data to MsSQL using the `MsSQLHook`.  Our DBA suggested using the `OdbcHook`, unfortunately the `OdbcHook` doesn't have the enhanced _generate_insert_sql for MsSQL as `OdbcHook` is agnostic of which database you connect to.  So in order to check if the `OdbcHook` would solve our connection issues with MsSQL, I temporarily patched the `_generate_insert_sql` method of the `OdbcHook` to test if the issues are solved using the `OdbcHook`. \r\n So we did a load test and indeed we did not experience any connection issues nor deadlocks and the performance was also a lot better compared to the `MsSqlHook`.  With the `MsSqlHook`, we had to specify the `max_active_tis_per_dag=1` parameter to prevent concurrent tasks and avoid deadlocks, with the `OdbcHook` we didn't have to but once again this can be pure coincidence due to the concurrency nature.\r\n\r\nSo that's why I started thinking about a more generic approach of this problem, which would work independently of which Connection type you use, and move all the logic to the `DbApiHook`, hence why I wanted to introduce the notion of a `Dialect` which can then be specialized where needed per database.  Of course we would need to think how we want it to be implemented, here I just did a bit of a naïve implemented to show the idea.  We are already using this in our Airflow environment through patched code and it works great, now we have to find a way to implement this idea (if accepted) in a good/clean and future proof approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

print(self)\r\n    print(context[\"inlet_events\"][asset1_producer])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, it create a `DAG(dag_id=\"asset2_producer\", schedule=None, ...)` and an `Asset(name=\"asset2_producer\", uri=\"s3://bucket/object\")`. Inside the function, `self` can be used to access the asset with name `asset2_producer`, `context` is just like `context` in a normal task and `asset1_producer` is used to access an asset with name=asset1_producer\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses:

PR introduces a new metric for the capacity left on each Triggerer.\r\n\r\nAfter reducing the default capacity our deployment, it is rather close to the total capacity at certain times and having visibility on the remaining capacity becomes more important.\r\n\r\nThe new metric will enable better alerting and even auto-scaling if wished for. The same can be achieved currently but it requires knowledge of the currently configured capacity, which makes it rather ugly.\r\n\r\nRegarding the naming: I initially wanted to prefix the new metric with `triggers.` but decided not to because all `triggers.*` metrics are really just counting/measuring actual triggers. That's why I decided to go with a new prefix `triggerer.` which may be used in the future for more Triggerer specific metrics.","created_at":"2024-08-08T06:07:17Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T01:41:11Z","closed_at":"2024-10-02T01:41:11Z","merged_at":"2024-10-02T01:41:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"e46fadc25679624a15d6775067d3cd2b513742d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ferruzzi","id":1920178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjAxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1920178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi","html_url":"https://github.com/ferruzzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferruzzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

List task instances (batch) - `/api/v1/dags/~/dagRuns/~/taskInstances/list`\r\n\r\norder_by defaults to sorting by start_date (ascending) for above mentioned 2 APIs. Please note that this does NOT change the default sorting param for the List mapped task instances API.\r\n\r\nThis also adds corresponding unit tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Problem\r\n1. Currently the DynamoDBToS3Operator only supports 2 ways of downloading data: \"full export using `scan`\" or \"full exports using boto3's `export_table_to_point_in_time`\". When using `export_table_to_point_in_time` method, you can also use \"Incremental Export\" instead of \"Full Export\" if you only wish for the delta of the data changes between the specified period. However this functionality is currently not supported in the DynamoDBToS3Operator. \r\n2. There are times we need to export the data from 1 AWS account (Account A) to another account (Account B). In the full export using `scan` method, you can specify 2 aws connection to facilitate this need. But for `export_table_to_point_in_time`, we would need an additional argument (`s3_bucket_owner`) to allow cross account export.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Changes\r\n1.
