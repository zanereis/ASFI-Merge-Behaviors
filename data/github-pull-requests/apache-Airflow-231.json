provides logging handlers that send logs to external services (Elasticsearch, StackDriver, etc). At the moment, if Elasticsearch is in use, links to its logs show up in the UI. This PR generalizes this functionality to other logging handlers.\r\n\r\nTo provide links to remote logs, a logging handler must inherit from `ExternalLoggingMixin` and implement `get_remote_log_url()` and `log_name()` methods. The view identifies when a remote logging handler is in use and renders the link to the external logs in the UI.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not close but is related to issue #9083.    \r\n\r\n---\r\nMake

the core code was maintained by the original creators - Airbnb. The code that was in the contrib package was supported by the community. The project was passed to the Apache community and currently the entire code is maintained by the community, so now the division has no justification, and it is only due to historical reasons.\r\n\r\nWe plan to deprecate the airflow.contrib package. Unfortunately, there are still a few modules left that block it.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I wrote a short README. which describes how to install this plugin. In the future, we can add more text to this file if we decide to develop this plugin\r\n\r\nIt's not breaking change, because this plugin was not automatically installed. Anyone who wanted to install it had to manually copy these files to plugin directory. We also did not mention this plugin in any documentation. We did not actively develop it, but rather treated it as an example plugin.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of

currently support focusing on upstream / downstream task dependencies in a mild way, namely by changing the color.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a big messy dag, though, more aggressive focusing is desirable.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we enhance the focus on the upstream / downstream tasks by setting opacity of all _other_ tasks and edges to 0.2.\r\n\r\nThis is the same approach that is already implemented in graph view when you mouseover task state, _and_ when you use the search function to filter tasks.\r\n\r\nBelow are screenshots when the mouse is over dummy 3.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15932138/85092748-3d06e580-b19f-11ea-9031-d0b3ab83de1c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15932138/85092784-55770000-b19f-11ea-8564-8b86a75aa6bd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Also**\r\n\r\nIn this PR I also apply highlightStrokeWidth to focused tasks.  If this one is merged, then #9297 is obsolete and can be closed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the

change applies stroke-width `highlightStrokeWidth` to upstream and downstream dependencies when mousing over a task (and restores `initialStrokeWidth` on mouseout).\r\n\r\n**More context**\r\n\r\nIn graph view, on mouseover task, upstream and downstream tasks will change color.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't increase the stroke width for the task box outline (i.e. it does not embolden the task outline).\r\n\r\nThis is something that is done when we search for tasks or mouseover a task state and the tasks are filtered -- just was not implemented for mouseover.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15932138/84625350-ee540580-ae97-11ea-819e-444df9f28442.png)\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15932138/84625363-f449e680-ae97-11ea-8d35-29a820d36302.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake

is a DRAFT and I still have to complete the missing documentation and unit tests.\r\n\r\nI wanted to prepare a minimal valuable product for the upgrade_check command. Only one rule is implemented, but I think that's enough to show the feature. In the next steps, we can think about what rules we need to create, create tickets, and then work on the next rules by the whole community. \r\n\r\nRecently, we have a lot of new beginner contributors and I think we can try to engage them for this task. Most rules will be small and independent, so they will be great candidates for good-first-issue.\r\n\r\nAn example of the result of this command is presented in the termianlshot below\r\n<img

cc: @dimberman @kaxil \r\n\r\nHi guys,\r\n\r\nSorry for the long wait. It took me a while to figure out where to properly put the changes and I am also occupied by other things. Anyway, here is a draft PR, for the proposed rewrite of the SubDagOperator. I will write out more details on the AIP tonight. But here is the gist.\r\n\r\n There are 3 main changes:\r\n1. Rewrite `DagBag.bag_dag` logic to attach tasks of the subdags to the root dag during dag file parsing. \r\n\r\n> Here is the overall process: \r\n> 1. it loops over the root dag's tasks \r\n> 2. When it meets a SubDagOperator, it unpacks the SubDag, and reattach all the tasks to the root dag. This unpacking process will traverse down to the SubDag's tasks.\r\n>\r\n> Here is the detailed unpacking process:\r\n> 1. Remove the `SubDagOperator` node from the `root_dag`\r\n> 2. loop over SubDag's task to re-attach them to the `root_dag`, and add `current_group` and `parent_group` metadata (see item 3 below).\r\n> 3. Remove `SubDagOperator` task_id from `upstream_tasks` and add `subdag.roots` to the upstream tasks; similarily for `downstream_tasks`\r\n> 4. Traverse down to the `subdag`,. It will do nothing if there is no nested `subdags`, and otherwise keep unpacking.\r\n\r\n2. Rewrite the `SubDagOperator`\r\n    - I remove most of the methods as they are not relevant anymore. \r\n    - Change the function signature to require a dag_factory function, and it will automatically pass the task_id as the first positional argument of the dag_factory function. It's cleaner because we don't need to match up the SubDagOperator.task_id with the subdag.dag_id manually.\r\n3. Add a TaskGroup model (`current_group/current_dag` and `parent_group/parent_dag`) that is used for grouping related tasks.  This is used to replace the concept of SubDag to group tasks together and render the visual grouping effect in the UI.\r\n    - When I was creating this, I feel like it does not need to be used for SubDag specifically, and we can actually group arbitrary tasks to allow generic metadata operation (e.g. monitor TIs of a task group, stop/retry a group of task etc)\r\n\r\nHere is a [example subdag](https://gist.github.com/xinbinhuang/28e5be91d9a494a350be79ee312bd7d5) dag I used to test out the new SubDag Operator. It can successfully unpack the subdags.\r\n\r\nThis is the comparison on the generated graph:\r\n\r\nOld:\r\n![official_subdag_example](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/_images/subdag_after.png)\r\n\r\nNew: \r\n![unpacked_subdag_dag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27927454/84456260-63170d80-ac14-11ea-9a0a-f04cc26d0bf7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems that there are a lot of SubDag related handling logic in the codebase, and it means that if we decide to go forward with the rewrite. We probably will need to clean up a lot of code. I believe it's a good thing?\r\n```bash\r\ngrep -r subdag airflow | wc -l\r\n162\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the things that I think need to be done:\r\n- Update the UI to review this change\r\n- Avoid task conflicts between root_dag and sub_dag. I am thinking to automatically concatenate the `current_group=subdag.dag_id=subdag_operator.task_id`, to the task_ids. \r\n- DB Migration\r\n- Clean up other subdag related logics from the codebase\r\n\r\nI have not created any tests yet for it as I want to have some discussion first. Let me know your thought :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBin\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [ ] Unit

\r\n\r\n - Resolves / Fixes: #9127 \r\n - The current Airflow 1.10.10 API for `EmrAddStepOperator` throws an error when it is initialized with `job_flow_name` (aka EMR cluster name) as opposed to `job_flow_id` (`AttributeError: 'EMR' object has no attribute 'get_cluster_id_by_name'`, see issue #9127 for more details). As a result, the task instance associated with the `EmrStep` as well as the corresponding `DagRun` fails. There is a bug in the `execute()` method of `emr_add_step_operator.py` class in which the EMR client uses the wrong API to retrieve the `job_flow_id` for the given `job_flow_name` passed to the `EmrAddStepOperator`. In other words, instead of calling the `get_cluster_id_by_name()` method from the `airflow.contrib.hooks.emr_hook.EmrHook` object, it is called from `botocore.client.EMR` object, which obviously throws an error. This is a very _simple_ fix for this bug. \r\n\r\n - Updated the current unit tests and passes. \r\n\r\n - Tested against Python 3.7.7 local environment\r\n\r\n - Airflow version used in the development: 1.10.10\r\n\r\n- Please Note: Latest `master` branch (Airflow 2.0.0dev) already fixes this issue, however the fix is not present in stable Airflow 1.10.10 version.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure
