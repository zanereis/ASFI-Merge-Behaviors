duplicating the logic on how to calculate job_id and keep it all in one module.\r\n\r\nTests were updated to explicitly check for each state job

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis PR optimizes the time required to process each JS test tagged as skipped or ported to elixir. \r\n\r\nPrevious to this PR before each JS test execution it is checked if CouchDB is running even if the test was tagged as skipped or ported. When a test is tagged as skipped or ported it should no be executed so the is running check is not required.\r\n\r\nThis PR cuts the test execution without checking if CouchDB is running improving the test suite execution time. In my dev host there is a gain of 30 secs.\r\n \r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a draft of [proposal](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rcc742c0fdca0363bb338b54526045720868597ea35ee6842aef174e0%40%3Cdev.couchdb.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRunning `make check` should be sufficient. You might need to comment out the [following line](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/prototype/fdb-layer/Makefile#L167) because elixir tests are failing for `prototype/fdb-layer`.\r\n\r\nYou also can run API version related test suite alone as follows `exunit tests=src/chttpd/test/exunit/api_version_test.exs`\r\n\r\nThe manual testing can be done using the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -u adm:pass \"http://127.0.0.1:15984/_all_dbs\"\r\n[\"_users\",\"test\"]\r\ncurl -u adm:pass \"http://127.0.0.1:15984/_all_dbs\" -H \"X-Couch-API: 1\"\r\n[\"_users\",\"test\"]\r\ncurl -u adm:pass

-u adm:pass \"http://127.0.0.1:15984/_v2/_all_dbs\"\r\n{\"bookmark\":\"123456\",\"items\":[\"foo\",\"bar\",\"baz\"]}\r\ncurl -u adm:pass \"http://127.0.0.1:15984/_all_dbs\" -H \"Accept:

multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

The original author makes many assumptions\r\nabout how quickly an (actual, unmocked) FDB instance will respond to a\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to stop failing CI builds, while other\r\nconsiderations include: keeping the run time of the test as low as\r\npossible, keeping the code coverage high, and documenting the known\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n- Increase the `stale` and `expired` times by a factor of 5 to decrease\r\nsensitivity to poor FDB performance.\r\n- Change default timer from `erlang:system_time/1` to `os:timestamp` on\r\nthe assumption that the latter is less prone to warping [2].\r\n- Decrease the period of the cache server reaper by half to increase\r\naccuracy of eviction time.\r\n- Inline and modify the `test_util:wait` code to make the timer\r\nexplicit, and emphasize that `timer:delay/1` only works with millisecond\r\nresolution.\r\n- Don't fail the test if it can't get a fresh lookup immediately after\r\ninsertion, but let it continue on to the next race, at least to the\r\npoint of expiration and deletion, which continue to be asserted.\r\n- Factor `Timeout` and `Interval` to allow declarations near the other\r\nhard-coded parameters.\r\n- Move cache server `Opts` into `setup/0` and eliminate `start_link/0`.\r\n- Double the overall test timeout to 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis has soaked for hundreds of runs on a 5 year old laptop, but the\r\nreal test is the CI system.\r\n\r\nShould this test continue to fail CI builds, additional improvements\r\ncould include mocking the timer and/or FDB layer to eliminate the\r\nvariability of an integrated system.\r\n\r\n[1] https://ci-couchdb.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/jenkins-cm1%2FPullRequests/detail/PR-2813/10/pipeline\r\n[2]

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is first PR which adds a none-blocking key cache. It uses shim for key manager which I will add in second PR and missing LRU parts which I'll add in third PR.\r\n\r\nFrom point of functinality separation `aegis.erl` consist of public API and all crypto implementation, `aegis_key_cache.erl` is a private keys cache that manages workers and waiting lists and acts as a bridge to a Key Management system that interfaced through `aegis_key_manager.erl`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nKey cache made to not block the main loop and it `spawn` or `spawn_monitor` all the incoming requests. In addition to ets cache it maintains three `dicts` - one for openers that requested new wrapped key or rewrap on existing key, second acting as a reverse index for those processes to make sure we have only one key request process per wrapped key in flight and third as a collection of waiting workloads to start once \"their\" key unwrapping finished and key inservet in the cache.\r\n\r\nI'm including a link on a flow diagram I was using to plan how it works, I hope it helps:\r\n\r\nhttps://bl.ocks.org/eiri/raw/5c166c1fef95e41835fd02df81f83c90/\r\n\r\n\r\n##

make sure that:\r\n  - produced warnings are only for (± 3) updated lines\r\n  - make fails with non 0 exit code  \r\n- Run `bin/emilio -c emilio.config src | bin/warnings_in_scope -s 0` to see warnings from `emilio`\r\n  - make sure produced warnings are only for updated lines\r\n- Run `bin/emilio -c emilio.config src` and make sure dependencies mentioned in `ignore` section of

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the size of binary chunks used for values is fixed at the FDB imposed limit of 100kB, although they recommend using 10KB [1], (also note they subtly change units).\r\n\r\nThis makes that value configurable, allowing e.g. benchmarks to compare performance of runs with varying chunk size. The cost is a ~10µs config lookup penalty each time data needs to be\r\nchunked.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.foundationdb.org/files/record-layer-paper.pdf\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n`make check` should pass. This code is trivial, and gets run every time a db is created or opened, so it will get coverage from the normal test suite.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nWhen an existing key is inserted with different timestamps, the primary\r\nkey is the same but the primary value is different from the existing one.\r\nCurrently, this results in a new expiry key being inserted, but the old\r\none is not deleted, and lingers until it is removed by the inexorable\r\nadvance of time via the `remove_expired` server messages.\r\n\r\nThis checks whether there's already primary key for the inserted key,\r\nand if so, cleans up the existing expiry key before proceeding with the\r\ninsert.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_expiring_cache\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable
