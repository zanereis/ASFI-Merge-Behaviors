all,\n\nI checked this issue yesterday with Daan, the problem is double UNICODE encoding, and it's the source in Transifex that is broken. There are ~250 broken characters, so fixing one by one in Transifex is a bit of a waste of time. I could fix this with a script, but I'm still wondering how the file received patches and remain in this state (as in: is there any other scenario where this double encoding shows up correct?)\n\nI've created a PR based on the tag

XenServer storage repository (SR) and virtual disk image (VDI) each have UUIDs that are immutable.\n\nThis poses a problem for SAN snapshots, if you intend on mounting the underlying snapshot SR alongside the source SR (duplicate UUIDs).\n\nVMware has a solution for this called re-signaturing (so, in other words, the snapshot UUIDs can be changed).\n\nThis PR only deals with the CloudStack side of things, but it works in concert with a new XenServer storage manager created by CloudOps (this storage manager enables re-signaturing of XenServer SR and VDI UUIDs).\n\nI have written Marvin integration tests to go along with this, but cannot yet check those into the CloudStack repo as they rely on SolidFire hardware.\n\nIf anyone would like to see these integration tests, please let me know.\n\nJIRA ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9281\n\nHere's a video I made that shows this feature in

learning about JDK8, lambdas, streams etc today. Thought it would be a good idea to get ACS codebase to latest mvn and jdk8. This is a WIP branch pushed on ACS remote so feel free to push changes if you're a committer or send PR.\n\nMajor changes:\n- Moved to latest JDK8\n- Moved to latest Maven 3.3.9 (-T threaded compilations appears faster)\n- Upgraded several dependencies to latest minor versions (or major in few cases)\n\nWhat fails/unsupported or TODOs:\n- Unit tests in cloud-server and few other places\n- F5 plugin fails, tried to resolve the issue but I was unable to grok it\n- Major spring framework version (that would be a lot of work on its own)\n- Major servlet version changes\n- Fix packaging, init.d/system.d JAVA_HOME paths\n- Check ACS agents with JDK/JRE8 (kvm, cpvm, ssvm)\n- Check and configure GC related changes wrt JRE7/JRE8 (in any configs, say tomcat configs)\n- Check against compatibility guide: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-compatibility-guide-2156366.html\n\nWhat works:\n- Compiling in -Dnoredist with -DskipTests to test if ACS codebase (minus unit tests) worked (non-issue once we fix the failing unit tests)\n- Deploy db worked\n- Running the management server locally with Java8\n","created_at":"2016-01-27T01:21:29Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T10:05:18Z","closed_at":"2016-01-28T10:05:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b616742bb279ada86d9a151becf285d3a055fe73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/7d3fab4060346a25f5f6fd52e819cea255149ebd","head":{"label":"apache:support-jdk8-mvnupgrades","ref":"support-jdk8-mvnupgrades","sha":"7d3fab4060346a25f5f6fd52e819cea255149ebd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

desired to mount a store with a specific NFS version, it has passed in <code>image_store_details</code> table for a store with id <code>Y</code> as a property:\n\n| store_id | name | value |\n| :-: |

PR fixes the issue when trying to delete ACL lists which contain item. \n\nIt seemed it was not thought of when the ACS project started, when most user were relying on the UI to execute those tasks. Nowadays, with automation all over the place and ACL lists containing hundreds of items, it's very hard to have to delete them 1 by 1 either via the UI. Writing scripts to do so might be a solution, but it would be much simpler to just delete non-attached ACLs with all its items in one go.\n\nAlso, destroying a VPC that contains ACL lists was \"succeeding\", but after that the ACL list/items were messing up:\n\n```\nlist networkacls aclid=920d74b6-4d15-454f-b3a6-61e7a6ffd1a4\nError 431: Unable to find VPC associated with acl\n{\n  \"cserrorcode\": 4350,\n  \"errorcode\": 431,\n  \"errortext\": \"Unable to find VPC associated with acl\",\n  \"uuidList\": []\n}\n```\n\nSo, it also cleans up ACLs when destroying VPCs\n","created_at":"2016-01-22T09:25:13Z","updated_at":"2016-01-26T06:56:14Z","closed_at":"2016-01-26T06:56:14Z","merged_at":"2016-01-26T06:56:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"d258455437f609fbb79ea6591d123229358a067b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/3ec37a0efd2f10a7ec6a5ff28bf0f71019b5eb94","head":{"label":"artificially-ai:fix/4.7-acl-delete-CLOUDSTACK-9245","ref":"fix/4.7-acl-delete-CLOUDSTACK-9245","sha":"3ec37a0efd2f10a7ec6a5ff28bf0f71019b5eb94","user":{"login":"artificially-ai","id":4188903,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQxODg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4188903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai","html_url":"https://github.com/artificially-ai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artificially-ai/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:4.7","ref":"4.7","sha":"8361595946dc26662b8181c92de4faaae4cc3c40","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

for instance.\nnow migrating to '10.10.10.10' will change both addresses in the xml description file for qemu. It is fixed and unit tests are added. I am not sure yet how to integration test this.
