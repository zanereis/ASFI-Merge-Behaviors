in RowDataToJsonConverters\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix JSON format serializing map type error.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Clear reused ObjectNode's content for map converter.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *JsonRowDataSerDeShemaTest.testSerDeMultiRows()*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*`CsvRowSerializationSchema` and `CsvRowDataSerializationSchema` serialize `Row` and `RowData` to byte array end with `\\n` at default. For the row-wise formats, it should consume and produce the bytes for a row.  `csv.line-delimiter` option is not a good option for csv format and shoud be removed for `CsvRowSerializationSchema` and `CsvRowDataSerializationSchema` to not append a new line.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *`CsvSchema` in `CsvRowSerializationSchema` and `CsvRowDataSerializationSchema` configures the line separator to empty string.*\r\n  - *`line-delimiter` option in `CsvFormatFactory`, `CsvRowFormatFactory` and `CsvFileSystemFormatFactory` is removed.*\r\n  - *`CsvFileSystemFormatFactory` encodes `RowData` record end with line delimiter `\\n` to write.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Remove the line delimiter config of test cases in `CsvRowDataSerDeSchemaTest` and `CsvRowDeSerializationSchemaTest` to verify whether the byte array which `CsvRowSerializationSchema` and `CsvRowDataSerializationSchema` serialize `Row` and `RowData` to includes line delimiter `\\n`.*\r\n  - *Remove the`line-delimiter` option of test cases in `CsvFormatFactoryTest` and `CsvRowFormatFactoryTest` to verify whether the `line-delimiter` option could be removed normally.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces SortMergeResultPartitionReader which is responsible for scheduling the sort-merge blocking shuffle data read requests. The scheduler always reads shuffle data in order of file offset which maximums the sequential read so the shuffle performance can be improved. We may also introduce this mechanism to the hash-based blocking shuffle in the future.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the current implementation in three main ways:\r\n1. For one result partition, it opens only one data/index file channel which is shared by all subpartition readers. It is good for stability.\r\n2. For one result partition, only minor size of unmanaged direct memory is used and the users do not need to increase direct memory size by default, which is good for usability.\r\n3. IO scheduling can improve the performance a lot on HDD. The previous basic implementation reduces the shuffle read time of a simple shuffle benchmark job from over 2h to 40-50min, with this PR, the shuffle read time can be further reduced to about 15min. (shuffle write time is about 10-15min)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduces SortMergeResultPartitionReader which is responsible for scheduling the sort-merge blocking shuffle data read requests.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nVerified by both existing and newly added test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

This leads to large state and memory buffer that is not needed for the first-n-row case. This PR introduces a lightweight variant of TopN function to handle it more efficiently. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  Add `AppendOnlyFirstNFunction` as a variant of AppendOnlyTopNFunction\r\n  -  Modify `StreamExecRank` to instantiate `AppendOnlyFirstNFunciton` when the first-n-row case is determined  \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  -  Added unit tests in`AppendOnlyFirstNFunctionTest` \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd parallelism config of elasticsearch dynamitic table sink\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nElasticsearch6DynamicSinkTest.testParallelismConfig\r\nElasticsearch7DynamicSinkTest.testParallelismConfig\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the current Sink API some method does not throw any exception, which should throw intuitively for example `SinkWriter::write`. Some method throw the normal `Exception`, which might be too general.\r\n\r\n So in this pr we want to add a IOException to all the I/O related methods signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add `IOException` to the `Sink:createWriter/createCommiter/createGlobalCommitter`*\r\n  - *Add `IOException` to the `SinkWriter::writer/prepareCommit/snapshotState`*\r\n  - *Add `IOException` to the `Committer::commit`*\r\n  - *Add `IOException` to the `GlobalCommitter::filterRecoveredCommittables/combine/commit/endOfInput`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

batch\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMigrate hive connector to FLIP-27 source for batch reading\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement `HiveSourceSplit` as sub-class of `FileSourceSplit`. It remembers the partition which a split belongs to.\r\n  - Implement `HiveSourceSplitSerializer` as SerDe for `HiveSourceSplit`.\r\n  - Implement `HiveSource` as sub-class of `AbstractFileSource`, and works with `RowData` and `HiveSourceSplit`.\r\n  - Implement `HiveSourceFileEnumerator` as an implementation of `FileEnumerator`, but it generates splits based on partitions rather than paths.\r\n  - Implement `HiveBulkFormatAdapter` as an implementation of `BulkFormat<RowData, HiveSourceSplit>`. It delegates the reading to other BulkFormat instances based on the information we have from each partition to read.\r\n  - Update `PartitionValueConverter` to take partition col name when converting the partition value. This makes it easier for hive to reuse `ParquetColumnarRowInputFormat` because the partition values have been pre-computed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-04T03:47:35Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T08:20:05Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T08:00:26Z","merged_at":"2020-11-05T08:00:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"56207e8a578394c01022bbe848d03cf8b97c2380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a0ef5815192defc2fc93df716e73d8a8410367fd","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-19365","ref":"FLINK-19365","sha":"a0ef5815192defc2fc93df716e73d8a8410367fd","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUser requirement:\r\nUsers need to look at a few random pieces of data in a table to see what the data looks like. So users often use the SQL:\r\n\"select * from table limit 10\"\r\nFor a large table, expect to end soon because only a few pieces of data are queried.\r\nFor DataStream or BoundedStream, they are push based execution models, so the downstream cannot control the end of source operator.\r\nWe need push down limit to source operator, so that source operator can end early.\r\n\r\nImplement a LimitableBulkFormat wrapper to limit output record number in the file source.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce `LimitableBulkFormat`\r\n- Integrate to `FileSystemTableSource`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `FileSystemITCaseBase.testLimitPushDown`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the new public classes as described in FLIP-142, JobManagerCheckpointStorage, FileSystemCheckpointStorage, HashMapStateBackend, and EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n97e2ed8  Adds `setDefaultSavepointDir` to StreamExecutionEnvironment and wires it into the StreamConfig\r\n\r\n1d004fab55  Adds the two checkpoint storage implementations, JobManagerCheckpointStorage and FileSystemCheckpointStorage. To maintain backward compatibility with existing flink-confs the configuration `state.checkpoint-storage` needs to be optional. The default value is `FileSystemCheckpointStorage` if a checkpoint directory is provided, `JobManagerCheckpointStorage` otherwise. I believe this will be the least surprising to users as virtually everyone who sets a checkpoint directory wants the full scalability of filesystem and not just externalized jm. Most of the tests come in the next commit where there are state backends to test these storage types with. \r\n\r\n791054dc  Adds the new state backends `HashMapStateBackend` and `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend`. Note to reviewers, I changed the existing `RocksDBStateBackend` to be a thin wrapper around the new `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend`. That is because it has so many configurations and is complex enough that I did not feel I could reasonably have enough test coverage over both. This way, every existing test in flink that uses RocksDB implicitly tests this new implementation so we can feel confident in its correctness. This commit also deprecates the now legacy state backends. \r\n \r\n\r\nI removed the commit for the PyFlink changes and will instead open that as a quick follow-up PR. I think it was a mistake to include that originally as it needs to be reviewed by a different set of contributors. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nUT / IT tests and all existing tests that use RocksDB.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented) I plan to add documentation as a follow up PR.

That is\r\n    because the exception thrown does not include the STATUS with which\r\n    the job failed, so we cannot distinguish between different reasons\r\n    of unsuccessful termination. This commit fixes this.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe `EmbeddedJobClient.getJobExecutionResult()` now throws the same exception as the execution in detached mode. This includes the usual exception thrown by the `jobResult.toJobExecutionResult(classLoader)` wrapped into an `UnsuccessfulTerminationException` which also includes the `ApplicationStatus`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTest was added in the `ApplicationDispatcherBootstrapTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a code improvement based on #11896. \r\n\r\nThis pull request introduct `single-field` format to (de)serialize message to a single field.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nModifications based on  #11896:\r\n- Rename format from `single-value` to `single-field`, because it's more literal that it's used for single field/column. And personally, 'value.format' = 'single-field' is better than 'value.format' = 'single-value' when it's used in Kafka connector. KSQL also has a similar feature for [single field (un)wrapping](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/serialization/#single-field-unwrapping).\r\n- Move clases to `flink-table-runtime-blink` for easy testing. \r\n- Using Flink's primitive TypeSerializers for encoding/decoding primitive values.\r\n- Encode `null` values as `null` `byte[]`. This may have limitation when used in `upsert-kafka`, because `upsert-kafka` treats null values as a tombstone message. Therefore, we recommend avoiding using `upsert-kafka` connector and `single-field` format if the field can have a null value. KSQL also has this [limitation](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/serialization/#controlling-deserializing-of-single-fields).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- `SingleFieldFormatFactoryTest` for verifing format factory\r\n- `SingleFieldSerDeSchemaTest` for verifying serializing and deserializing values with different types.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

state updates for `ExecutionStateUpdateListener` in `ExecutionGraph#notifyExecutionChange` are not done at the moment because `ExecutionGraph#notifyExecutionChange` is currently enabled only for legacy scheduling. This prevents from stopping deployment tracking for execution state TM/JM reconciliation, hence memory leaks. The state update handling is supposed to be done only in `SchedulerNG` (`DefaultScheduler`), not in legacy code of `ExecutionGraph`. However, this generally requires more refactoring for execution deployment tracking and reconciliation.\r\n\r\nHence, this PR just enables ExecutionStateUpdateListener state updates in `ExecutionGraph#notifyExecutionChange` for `SchedulerNG` as a quick fix, before we [refactor the execution deployment tracking and reconciliation](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19954).\r\n\r\n`JobMasterExecutionDeploymentReconciliationTest#testExecutionDeploymentReconciliation` is also extended with the check that `ExecutionStateUpdateListener` is called and the execution deployment tracking is stopped. The PR also refactors tests in `JobMasterExecutionDeploymentReconciliationTest` and introduces `TestingExecutionDeploymentTrackerWrapper` to facilitate `ExecutionDeploymentTracker` call checks.","created_at":"2020-11-03T13:24:17Z","updated_at":"2020-11-04T08:01:35Z","closed_at":"2020-11-04T08:01:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf3d4310713ae4e049ed519e35982eaebd58183f","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1cad880cd1ad7ff12f7392fa69f649330525aaba","head":{"label":"azagrebin:FLINK-19927","ref":"FLINK-19927","sha":"1cad880cd1ad7ff12f7392fa69f649330525aaba","user":{"login":"azagrebin","id":10573485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTczNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10573485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin","html_url":"https://github.com/azagrebin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":127914721,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjc5MTQ3MjE=","name":"flink","full_name":"azagrebin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azagrebin","id":10573485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTczNDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10573485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin","html_url":"https://github.com/azagrebin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagrebin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azagre

so many times.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*fix flink SecurityOptions.class use depracted method

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen calling `NOW()` function, it will throw compile exception. The root reason is that the return type of `NOW()` is `TIMESTAMP`, however the runtime method returns `long` type. \r\n\r\nActually, `NOW()` is synonyms for `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, so we can simply use the same code generation for `NOW`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add code generation for `NOW()` to use the same generation of `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.\r\n- Remove util method of `now()` in `SqlDateTimeUtils`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added tests in `NonDeterministicTests` which can reproduce this exception.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the streaming execution mode there are two uncertain things:\r\n\r\n1. The order of receiving the checkpoint complete.(`Committer` receive first or `GlobalCommitter` receive first)\r\n1. Whether the operator can receive the last checkpoint\r\n This patch does following two things to resolve `SinkITCase`'s unstable owning to these two uncertainty \r\n\r\nThis pr does two things\r\n1. Changing how to verifying the output of `GlobalCommitter` for the case 1\r\n2. Let the `FiniteTestSource` exit only when the Committer/GlobalCommitter received all the elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *This patch changes how to verifying the output of `GlobalCommitter` to resolve `SinkITCase`'s unstable owning to this uncertainty.*\r\n  - *FiniteTestSource exits only after user provide condition is satisfied or time out.*\r\n  - *All streaming mode ITCases exit only when the Committer/GlobalCommitter receive all the data or time out*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the new public classes as described in FLIP-142, JobManagerCheckpointStorage, FileSystemCheckpointStorage, HashMapStateBackend, and EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend. It builds on #13797 so only the last 3 commits are relevant. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n4d944f8 Adds `setDefaultSavepointDir` to StreamExecutionEnvironment and wires it into the StreamConfig\r\n\r\n409d151 Adds the two checkpoint storage implementations, JobManagerCheckpointStorage and FileSystemCheckpointStorage. To maintain backward compatibility with existing flink-confs the configuration `state.checkpoint-storage` needs to be optional. The default value is `FileSystemCheckpointStorage` if a checkpoint directory is provided, `JobManagerCheckpointStorage` otherwise. I believe this will be the least surprising to users as virtually everyone who sets a checkpoint directory wants the full scalability of filesystem and not just externalized jm. Most of the tests come in the next commit where there are state backends to test these storage types with. \r\n\r\n15e4b86 Adds the new state backends `HashMapStateBackend` and `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend`. Note to reviewers, I changed the existing `RocksDBStateBackend` to be a thin wrapper around the new `EmbeddedRocksDBStateBackend`. That is because it has so many configurations and is complex enough that I did not feel I could reasonably have enough test coverage over both. This way, every existing test in flink that uses RocksDB implicitly tests this new implementation so we can feel confident in its correctness. This commit also deprecates the now legacy state backends. \r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nUT / IT tests and all existing tests that use RocksDB.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented) I plan to add documentation as a follow up PR.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdds a sanity check to ensure that BATCH execution on the DataStream API actually behaves the way we expect. We ensure that jobs can be executed in stages and that a failure doesn't cause the whole job to be restarted but only the stages that need to be restarted.\r\n\r\n**Note to reviewers: The second test actually doesn't work because the job cannot be executed on just 1 slot.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces ReduceTransformation and a corresponding translator\r\nthat produces runtime execution mode dependent operator.\r\n\r\nThe operator for the BATCH execution instead of emitting intermediate results after each incoming event it registers a callback for max watermark and then emits the result for a given key when the timer fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Added tests in `org.apache.flink.test.streaming.runtime.ReduceITCase`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis makes it more consistent with other sink runtime operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-02T14:31:51Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T07:50:52Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T07:50:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cdd9e4d0d9b339c2202108666e8d11c20bfb2549","assignee":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b5dc1fcf3854ec912674aa2eb2bc5a89f0edbe80","head":{"label":"guoweiM:FLINK-19841","ref":"FLINK-19841","sha":"b5dc1fcf3854ec912674aa2eb2bc5a89f0edbe80","user":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85899056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg5OTA1Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"guoweiM/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","typ

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch decouples the `GlobalCommitter` from the `Committer` interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n`GlobalCommitter` does not extends from `Committer` any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-02T14:16:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T07:50:52Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T07:50:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3572d9ad4e4aa85a9a2821151921b5cb0e7553f1","assignee":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3be9c471fdd3fcfa9d12aec41d01dadfe54a9efb","head":{"label":"guoweiM:FLINK-19760","ref":"FLINK-19760","sha":"3be9c471fdd3fcfa9d12aec41d01dadfe54a9efb","user":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85899056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg5OTA1Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"guoweiM/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","typ

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis makes it more consistent with SourceReader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-02T13:54:02Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T07:50:51Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T07:50:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da1fbef9d2d95e0c269bc22b05a00242bb4b37d6","assignee":{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kl0u","id":2405800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDU4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2405800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u","html_url":"https://github.com/kl0u","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kl0u/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9d5d7fb61daf32c46adf87091eaa84a847381aaa","head":{"label":"guoweiM:FLINK-19833","ref":"FLINK-19833","sha":"9d5d7fb61daf32c46adf87091eaa84a847381aaa","user":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85899056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg5OTA1Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"guoweiM/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","typ

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* The Flink Kinesis EFO consumer has a SubscribeToShard retry policy which will terminate the job after a given number of subsequent attempt failures. In high backpressure scenarios the Netty HTTP Client throws a ReadTimeoutException when the consumer takes longer than 30s to process a batch. If this happens (by default) 10 times in a row, the job will terminate. There is no need to terminate in this condition, and the restart results in the job falling further behind.\r\n* There is a queue used to pass events between the network client and consumer application. When an error is thrown in the network thread, the queue is cleared to make space for the error event. This means that records will be thrown away to make space for errors (the records would be subsequently reloaded from the shard).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Excluded the ReadTimeoutException from the SubscribeToShard retry policy, such that that connector will gracefully reconnect once the consumer has processed the queued records.\r\n* Added a new mechanism to pass exceptions between threads, meaning data does not need to be discarded. When an error is thrown, the error event will be processed by the consumer once all of the records have been processed.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Existing unit tests continue to pass\r\n* Added additional test coverage\r\n* Deployed and tested on local Flink cluster\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRead checkpoint stream with buffer to speedup restore.\r\n\r\nThere will be many small IOs in the restore process,  frequent small io is not friendly to disk. So add buffer to improve IO performance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add config `state.backend.fs.read-buffer-size`\r\n  - Design FSDataBufferedInputStream, FSDataInputStream with buffer\r\n  - Use FSDataBufferedInputStream to wrap fsDataInputStream in HeapRestoreOperation#restore.\r\n\r\ntips: \r\nThe design of FSDataBufferedInputStream refers to FsCheckpointStateOutputStream and Java's BufferedInputStream.\r\nCompared to Java's BufferedInputStream, the seek and getPos interfaces are mainly added.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added order read for FSDataBufferedInputStream\r\n  - Added seek and random read for FSDataBufferedInputStream\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR includes three changes:\r\n- Enables downstream failover for approximate local recovery. That says if a task fails, all its downstream tasks restart, including itself. This is achieved by reusing the existing `RestartPipelinedRegionFailoverStrategy` --- treat each individual task connected by ResultPartition.Pipelined_Approximate as a separate region. \r\n- Expose Approximate downstream failover flag as an internal feature flag in CheckpointConfig: `approximateLocalRecovery`\r\n- ITcases downstream failover\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- introduce an attribute \"reconnectable\" in ResultPartitionType to indicate whether the partition is reconnectable. Notice that this is only a temporary solution for now. It will be removed after:\r\n\t 1. Approximate local recovery has its won failover strategy to restart the failed set of tasks instead of\r\n\t      restarting downstream of failed tasks depending on {@code RestartPipelinedRegionFailoverStrategy}\r\n\t 2. FLINK-19895: Unify the life cycle of ResultPartitionType Pipelined Family. There is also a good discussion on this in FLINK-19632.\r\n- PipelinedRegionComputeUtil#buildRawRegions to build each task connected by PIPELINED_APPROXIMATE as a region.\r\n- JobMasterPartitionTrackerImpl#startTrackingPartition to track the pipelined_approximate partition\r\n- Introduce an internal flag `approximateLocalRecovery` in CheckpointConfig to enable the feature.\r\n- ITCase (examples) how to use Approximate downstream failover.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUnittests + ITCases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is third(last solid code change) PR of [FLIP-144](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-144%3A+Native+Kubernetes+HA+for+Flink#FLIP144:NativeKubernetesHAforFlink-Resourceversion), which will introduces `KubernetesCheckpointRecoveryFactory`. It is responsible for creating the `CompletedCheckpointStore` and `CheckpointIDCounter` based on Kubernetes API.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #13864, Please start review with the commit with title **_[hotfix][test] Make TestingRetrievableStateStorageHelper is settable with exception_**.\r\n\r\nEach job will have a dedicated ConfigMap, which is the JobManager leader, for storing the checkpoint pointers.

`FlinkLogicalTableSourceScan` and `CommonPhysicalTableSourceScan` now respect the config option,\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - `FlinkLogicalTableSourceScan` and `CommonPhysicalTableSourceScan`

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nmodify documentation error\r\ncorrect：“p1 must have a value between 1 and 3”\r\nurl:https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/dev/table/types.html\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nmodify flink/docs/dev/table/types.md\r\nmodify flink/docs/dev/table/types.zh.md\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-01T10:01:37Z","updated_at":"2021-02-13T06:39:17Z","closed_at":"2021-02-13T06:39:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1570a17d8c60888d4431ae6b40b79fe95b14f81d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/143a9c684ee6710cb20db10c7bb3017fdf29eac2","head":{"label":"zihaodeng:installation-translate","ref":"installation-translate","sha":"143a9c684ee6710cb20db10c7bb3017fdf29eac2","user":{"login":"zihaodeng","id":7930414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzA0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7930414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zihaodeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":279596790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk1OTY3OTA=","name":"flink","full_name":"zihaodeng/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zihaodeng","id":7930414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzA0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7930414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zihaodeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihaodeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zihaodeng/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA failing Hadoop 3.1.3 YARN test on CI hinted at a problem with the recently introduced rolling of log files through log4j (https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/13457).\r\nThe number of rolled log files to keep is configured via an environment variable, which is set by the standalone scripts. In case of YARN (and also other resource managers), the environment variable is not available. Logs are managed by the resource managers, so it is save to just set a default value for the rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a failing nightly test.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is second PR of [FLIP-144](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-144%3A+Native+Kubernetes+HA+for+Flink#FLIP144:NativeKubernetesHAforFlink-Resourceversion), which will introduces `KubernetesRunningJobRegistry` and `KubernetesJobGraphStore`. Since the running the jobs and job graphs is added/updated by dispatcher, we need to store them in the dispatcher leader ConfigMap. Then we could perform a check-leader-and-update transactional operation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #13644. Please start review with the commit with title **_[hotfix] Move RetrievableStateStorageHelper and implementation out of zookeeper package so that it could be reused by Kubernetes high-availability_**.\r\n\r\nThe ConfigMap looks like following.\r\n```\r\nwangyang-pc:flink-runtime danrtsey.wy$ kubectl get cm k8s-ha-app-pr2-dispatcher-leader -o yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\ndata:\r\n  address: akka.tcp://flink@172.20.1.33:6123/user/rpc/dispatcher_1\r\n  jobGraph-00000000000000000000000000000000: 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\r\n  runningJobsRegistry-00000000000000000000000000000000: RUNNING\r\n  sessionId: bcf3cfe7-02a1-44be-8cf7-35699182b412\r\nkind: ConfigMap\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader: '{\"holderIdentity\":\"f212444f-ded6-435d-80e3-4760e5ef4e90\",\"leaseDuration\":15.000000000,\"acquireTime\":\"2020-10-30T10:44:49.374000Z\",\"renewTime\":\"2020-10-31T11:29:04.416000Z\",\"leaderTransitions\":17812}'\r\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-10-30T10:04:09Z\"\r\n  labels:\r\n    app: k8s-ha-app-pr2\r\n    configmap-type: high-availability\r\n    type: flink-native-kubernetes\r\n  name: k8s-ha-app-pr2-dispatcher-leader\r\n  namespace: default\r\n  resourceVersion: \"1828343282\"\r\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/k8s-ha-app-pr2-dispatcher-leader\r\n  uid: 35980167-db79-42ae-a95a-5384703e8c61\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Introduce the interface `StateHandleStore` and make `ZooKeeperStateHandleStore` as a implementation\r\n* Introduce new interfaces and data structure for `JobGraphStore` composition mechanism\r\n* Wire `ZooKeeperJobGraphStore` to the new interface\r\n* Implement `KubernetesStateHandleStore` based on Kubernetes API\r\n* Implement `KubernetesJobGraphStore` based Kubernetes API\r\n* Implement `KubernetesRunningJobsRegistry` based Kubernetes API\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* All the new introduce classes have the corresponding tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

some adjustments to the `JobMasterTest` to make it compatible with declarative resource management.\r\n\r\n`testAcceptSlotOfferAfterLeaderChange`:\r\n- use a JobGraph with at least 1 vertex; an empty JG has no resource requirements, causing the slot pool to reject all slot offers\r\n\r\n`testSlotRequestTimeoutWhenNoSlotOffering`:\r\n- do not intercept slot requests, and instead wait until the job has restarted a few times\r\n  - slot requests are not issued with declarative resource management\r\n- furthermore, register the task executor right away, instead of waiting for the slot request\r\n  - seemed unnecessary\r\n\r\n`testReleasingTaskExecutorIfNoMoreSlotsRegistered`:\r\n- migrate from JM#notifyAllocationFailure to JM#failSlot\r\n  - notifyAllocationFailure must not be called with declarative resource management\r\n  - also uses a fixed TaskManagerLocation, since the slot offer must match a registered task executor\r\n\r\n- use random AllocationIDs for slot offers; similar to

Hive built-in functions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix NPEs when using hive UDFs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Properly handle hive UDFs in UserDefinedFunctionUtils\r\n  - Add test cases\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test cases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, both sources and watermark/timestamp operators can emit watermarks that we don't really need. We only need a final watermark in BATCH execution mode. `TimestampsAndWatermarksOperator` should check whether to periodically emit watermarks or only one final watermark at the end of input by the runtime execution mode.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *`TimestampsAndWatermarksOperator` adds `emitProgressiveWatermarks` to check whether to periodically emit watermarks or only one final watermark at the end of input by the runtime execution mode.*\r\n  - *`watermarkGenerator` in `TimestampsAndWatermarksOperator` periodically calls the `onPeriodicEmit` method if `emitProgressiveWatermarks` is true.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *`periodicWatermarksEmitOnPeriodicEmit` and `periodicWatermarksOnlyEmitOnPeriodicEmit` in `TimestampsAndWatermarksOperatorTest` adds the test cases for the batch runtime execution mode to verfiy whether to periodically emit watermarks in batch execution mode.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the result type of IS NULL and IS NOT NULL\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Generate not null boolean as result type for IS NULL and IS NOT NULL\r\n  - Add test case, which would fail due to argument mismatch w/o this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test case\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Introduce the upsert kafka table factory*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added table factory*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added table factory test*\r\n  - *Added ITCases*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-30T03:52:49Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T12:43:24Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T13:10:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5eb98db4ff7e5f285b929cf07bac48cb7484e238","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8e4ebec4831e4e2800adb10eb12980869214674a","head":{"label":"fsk119:FLINK-19858","ref":"FLINK-19858","sha":"8e4ebec4831e4e2800adb10eb12980869214674a","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis refactors several parts of the new File Source API for classes that need to subclass `FileSourceSplit` to add extra information to the splits.\r\n\r\nExamples of that are the Hive Source and the Iceberg Source.\r\n\r\nThe changes here are purely in the yet unreleased File Source API and hence have no compatibility issues.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - [FLINK-19800] Make the interaction between `FileSourceSplit` and `FileSourceSplitState` extensible, to support different split types in the reader.\r\n  - [FLINK-19803] Make `PendingSplitCheckpoint` and its Serializer generic to support sub-classes of `FileSourceSplit`\r\n  - [FLINK-19802] Changes `BulkFormat.createReader(...)` and `BulkFormat.restoreReader(...)` to accept `FileSourceSplit` (or its subclasses) directly, to allow passing extra information via subclasses of `FileSourceSplit` \r\n  - [FINK-19804] Introduces an `AbstractFileSource` that is generic with respect to split types and changes `FileSource` to extend from that for the specific case of using `FileSourceSplit`. This makes the generics handling simpler for the common case (using `FileSource`).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a refactoring that does not change any functionality.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **yes** (but unreleased)\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **not applicable**\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-29T23:44:52Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T15:34:30Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T15:34:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb4793cc00bfcf18e9c4fbd6bf65b604c41a3bce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13847/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/13847/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/13847/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2046761529b63e6506b8a5448f740a65fb23a339","head":{"label":"StephanEwen:file_source_extensible","ref":"file_source_extensible","sha":"2046761529b63e6506b8a5448f740a65fb23a339","user":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21171031,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTE3MTAzMQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"StephanEwen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR concludes rescaling for unaligned checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Uses the `InflightDataRescalingDescriptor` introduced by FLINK-19533.\r\n- Adds `VirtualChannelSelector` event and adds demultiplexing on input side.\r\n- Emits `VirtualChannelSelector` on recovery on input and output side and replicates data according to channel mapping in rescaling descriptor.\r\n- Adds check for custom partitioner and allow UC rescaling for supported cases.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdds rescaling tests in UnalignedCheckpointITCase. Enables unaligned checkpoint in all e2e tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the e2e tests for the new FileSink. In the e2e tests we mainly focus on cases of TaskMangers get killed, thus we only test the streaming mode since for batch mode, in this version the new file sink still not be able to achieve exactly-once if the ResultPartition gets lost. The stream & batch mode for cases of task failover is covered by `FileSinkITCase`. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the PR is roughly a copy of the E2E test of the `StreamingFileSink`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 86e3c5950cf82baa0a5e3078b0c30050f262dcb0 adds the test program and the test scripts.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a test for itself.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Multiple input operator for batch is implemented in [FLINK-19627](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19627). This pr aims to introduce multiple input operator for streaming. Different from batch multiple input operator, the stream multiple input operator should handle key selector, state/checkpoint/barrier operations. If each sub-operator in a multiple input operator has a state handler, it involves many change in runtime. So all sub-operators share a same state handler. There are three main problems we need to solve:\r\n1. stateHandler in AbstractStreamOperatorV2 is private, we need to change it to protected so that StreamMultipleInputStreamOperator can access it*\r\n2. stateHandler in AbstractStreamOperator is created when calling initializeState method. We need to add a new method and pass the StreamMultipleInputStreamOperator's stateHandler to AbstractStreamOperator so that the sub-operators could share same stateHandler instance.\r\n3. StreamMultipleInputStreamOperator may contain operators with same type (e.g. two aggregate operators), they have same state name. This can lead to the wrong state values. We introduce StateNameAware and StateNameContext to make sure all state names in a multiple input operator are unique.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Rename BatchExecMultipleInputNode/StreamExecMultipleInputNode to BatchExecMultipleInput/StreamExecMultipleInput*\r\n  - *Stream planner support multiple input node*\r\n  - *Introduce AbstractStreamOperator#initializeState(StreamOperatorStateHandler, InternalTimeServiceManager<?>) method so that AbstractStreamOperator can use existing state handler*\r\n  - *Change access modifier priority of `stateHandler` and `timeServiceManager` from `private` to `protected` in AbstractStreamOperatorV2 so that the sub-class of AbstractStreamOperatorV2 can access stateHandler*\r\n  - *Introduce multiple input operator for streaming*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *The first, third and fourth commit is a trivial rework and is already covered by existing tests*\r\n  - *The second commit is verified by TableOperatorWrapperGeneratorTest, TableOperatorWrapperTest and ExplainTest*\r\n  - *The last commit is verified by InputTest, OutputTest, StreamMultipleInputStreamOperatorTest*\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`JoinDeriveNullFilterRule` will filter out null join keys to prevent data skew for joins. Currently this rule is only applied before join reorder. After join reorder the join keys for some inputs might change and we need to apply this rule again.\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the rule again after join reorder.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Apply `JoinDeriveNullFilterRule` after join reorder\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by running the added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Shuffle is one of the most heavy operation, and many shuffle operations is redundant, because the input operators have provide the required shuffle. Blink batch planner has supported removing redundant shuffle through planner rules, Blink streaming planner could also leverage similar approach to remove redundant shuffle. Different batch, stream operators require the shuffle keys and the state keys must be exactly the same, otherwise the state may be not correct. In this pr, we only support Join and regular Aggregate, other operators will be supported  in the future.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Do some code cleanup for BatchExecCalcBase and BatchExecCorrelateBase*\r\n  - *Introduce join condition equal transfer rules to simplify join condition*\r\n  - *Remove redundant shuffle for StreamExecJoin And StreamExecGroupAggregate*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *The existing tests could cover the first two commits, e.g. batch.sql.RemoveShuffleTest, stream.sql.join.JoinReorderTest*\r\n  - *Added new test that validates the result of third commit, e.g. stream.sql.RemoveShuffleTest, RemoveShuffleITCase*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the special case when the reuse of exchange causes the deadlock.\r\n\r\nCurrently the reuse of exchange is not considered to be a deadlock because although the exec node of an exchange is reused, its underlying transformation is not reused. However if this behavior changes a deadlock may occur.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Fix special case when the reuse of exchange causes the deadlock\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, also this change added tests and can be verified by running the added cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The
