https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7218#issuecomment-499250400 including a `BIGINT` column type as a time column in Presto is problematic as it could represent either a Unix time in seconds or milliseconds. \r\n\r\nThe current correct way to handle Unix time columns is to set the `python_date_format` as either `epoch` or `epoch_ms` (depending on the encoding) which results in queries comprising the correct fidelity: \r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS \"count\"\r\nFROM \"superset\".\"logs\"\r\nWHERE \"dttm\" >= 1553644800\r\n  AND \"dttm\" <= 1554249600\r\nORDER BY

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAs @agrawaldevesh correctly identified in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6721 previously we were computing the Unix timestamp for the _right-hand-side_ (RHS) of the temporal filter condition using the local time zone as opposed to UTC which is the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) of a Unix timestamp (or epoch). \r\n\r\n@agrawaldevesh's change was behind a feature flag and disabled by default however this clearly is a bug and I sense we should remedy the problem by merely replacing the previously incorrect logic. Note I strongly believe users were probably unaware of the issue as Unix timestamps aren't human readable. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell I believe that the `database_expression` field for SQLAlchemy datasources is obsolete. Why? There are currently two (independent) mechanisms for for converting a Python date-time into the appropriate data type for temporal filters (which are only used [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/45b988051614bda145add7934af2d310f3a94754/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L135)): \r\n\r\n1. `python_date_format`: Which is used explicitly for string like or numeric types (represent Unix timestamps) and converts a Python `datetime` object into either a string or numeric type.\r\n2. `database_expression`: Which is used for date, date-time like types and converts a Python `datatime` object into the native database type using a SQL expression. \r\n\r\nThe reason the later is not required is each engine has already defined the date-time conversion (via the `convert_dttm` function for the various temporal types the engine supports in [db_engine_specs](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs.py). \r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the [`dttm_sql_literal `](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/45b988051614bda145add7934af2d310f3a94754/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L176) method to simply deprecate the need for `database_expression` as the appropriate conversion will occur [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/45b988051614bda145add7934af2d310f3a94754/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L200).\r\n\r\nFor reference I examined our deployment where the `database_expression` field was defined, of the 15 records only four contained valid SQL and in all cases they were being used either i) incorrectly, i.e., the filter comparison resulted in mixed types, or ii) in an unnecessary manner. For example there was a record (associated with a Presto datasource) which contained the following fields: \r\n\r\n- `type`: `VARCHAR`\r\n-  `expression`: `FROM_UNIXTIME(CAST(timestamp as BIGINT) / 1000)`\r\n- `database_expression`: `DATE_PARSE('{}', '%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%i:%%s')`\r\n\r\nThe mistake here is that `FROM_UNIXTIME` returns a `TIMESTAMP` rather than `VARCHAR` and had the type been correctly defined, the `PrestoEngineSpec.convert_dttm` method would have correctly handled the conversion [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/45b988051614bda145add7934af2d310f3a94754/superset/db_engine_specs.py#L1199). Note if the `timestamp` column was expressed as milliseconds since epoch the column could have been defined as:\r\n\r\n- `type`: `BIGINT`\r\n- `python_date_format`: `epoch_ms`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

current dashboard filters state, and chart's parent tab information (if it has one). But currently, dashboard's selected filters values are not included in the shorten url.\r\n\r\nI found in dashboard's component, we used `filters` props for dashboard's selected filters state. But for `Chart` component, we used `filters` props to carry the values for the current filter_box, so that current filter_box will pre-populate selected values.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n`filter` prop should be assigned at the right place.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@michellethomas @etr2460 @kristw @williaster

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nBuilds off of comments in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/6942. Sets three row limits for the following uses.\r\n\r\nSQL_MAX_ROW: The upper limit for rows returned from any query. Prevents excessive load on the database\r\nDISPLAY_MAX_ROW: The upper limit for rows displayed in SQL Lab. Prevents browser crashes. Should be <= SQL_MAX_ROW\r\nDEFAULT_SQLLAB_LIMIT: The default limit for queries in SQL Lab. Can be overwritten by the user to any value between 1 and DISPLAY_MAX_ROW\r\n\r\nIf anyone has other ideas to simplify this, I'm happy to take another stab at it. However, I think that with these three variables we can represent all levers required for admins and also prevent users from crashing their browsers.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nWarning text + tooltip if DISPLAY_MAX_ROW cuts off displayed results:\r\n<img width=\"1576\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-03 at 1 14 12 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/58831406-81a9f800-8601-11e9-9604-908e50ac0c61.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n1. Set the DISPLAY_MAX_ROW value to something smaller\r\n1. Set your query limit in the SQL Lab UI higher than the DISPLAY_MAX_ROW value\r\n1. See LIMIT warning label with the warning message\r\n\r\nAlso test:\r\n- Limits below the DISPLAY_MAX_ROW still work\r\n- CSV download isn't affected by DISPLAY_MAX_ROW\r\n- The limits are applied on both sync and async queries\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x]

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nA recent change went in that displayed Presto rows and arrays more clearly. To do this, we had to parse the data type format \"<column name> <data type>(<column name> <data type> ...)\". We parsed it according to parentheses and whitespace. \r\n\r\nThis did not take into account column names with whitespace and would break. This fix will quote column names with whitespace and then remove the quotes after parsing the data type.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested manually and added unit test\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nA few users reported SQL Lab has issue like:\r\n- user open sql lab with old queries\r\n- sql lab shows query has `success` state and progress bar shows 100%\r\n- but sql lab doesn't show query results.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not consistently re-produceable. When I hit this screen, I open browser's console to see what is wrong. In this line: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/71f1bbd2ec59b99d6ba6d9a4a2f9cfceaf922b80/superset/assets/src/SqlLab/components/SouthPane.jsx#L85\r\nSQL lab tries to display the last query in the list (all queries belongs to the current editor id), but sometimes the last query element in the list doesn't have `results`, and it seems not the latest query that user played. \r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nI found SQL Lab record `latestQueryId` in redux state, and we had `latestQuery` props in `TabbedSqlEditors`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWe do not immediately display Presto rows and arrays clearly in the data grid. This feature separates out nested fields and data values to help clearly display structural columns. Hopefully in the future, we can apply similar enhancements for other data sources.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE SCREENSHOTS\r\nHere ColumnA is a row column that contains two nested fields 1) an integer field and 2) a string field. We cannot immediately tell what are the nested fields' names. If this was a more complicated column (i.e. The data type is row(nested_array1 array(row nested_field int, nested_array2 ...)))), then you can imagine how difficult it would be to read the data values.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"88\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-16 at 11 50 16 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/58666517-6466e800-82e8-11e9-9ef1-bfbb1274004c.png\">\r\n\r\n### AFTER SCREENSHOTS\r\nHere we have pulled out the nested fields into its own columns. This is much more readable.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"510\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-16 at 1 34 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/58666674-db03e580-82e8-11e9-8742-45b7eb863eef.png\">\r\nHere ColumnB is an array where data values are pulled out into subsequent rows.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-16 at 4 04 23 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47833996/58666707-f111a600-82e8-11e9-99ff-d1e0f695e43e.png\">\r\n\r\n(Note: Ignore the visual enhancements - grayed out columns and data values. We will be adding visual enhancements in a separate PR)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested manually and added unit tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

transition back into the running state. Just as we don't refresh stopped queries, we should also not refresh failed queries. This PR makes that change.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![May-30-2019 14-16-13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/58666468-384b6700-82e8-11e9-8510-40af3c4f29b6.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![May-30-2019 14-18-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/58666473-3c778480-82e8-11e9-9eb0-0c154cc3cc4e.gif)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nTest a failing query with the change and see the error message displayed.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when trying to create a filter for values that match a string with a trailing space (e.g. \"test \"). Previously, the trailing space would get stripped out, turning a filter with value: `\"test \"` into a where clause of format: `WHERE column_name = 'test'`.\r\n\r\nSometimes data comes with trailing spaces, and we should respect the user's request to filter with the trailing space. This is especially important when making Filter Boxes for dashboards, as they populate with actual data values yet currently return no data if the value ends with a space.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nRunning tests in CI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nOn a line chart using the advanced analytics with time shift 1 year incorrectly evaluates to 366 days as the delta and as a result shows incorrect data. `parse_human_timedelta` looks forward in time when evaluating the human timedelta to number of days, but it's used in time compare to look back in time and compare current points to a previous delta. Around leap years the number of days 1 year ahead is not the same as 1 year behind. More details of the issue are in #7311 \r\n\r\nI'm keeping parse_human_timedelta the way it is and adding another function to specify that we want the past delta (so `-1 year` if we are given `1 year`), and returning a positive timedelta as we were previously. I looked into just making parse_human_timedelta return a negative delta, but it makes the logic in viz.py look a bit more confusing with delta =+ parse_human_timedelta(...) when it would actually be subtracting the negative delta.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This will change the data for time shift (1 year, 1 month,...) but it will be accurate.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `python-dotenv` is an extra requirement for Flask and thus it seemed prudent to specify it there. Additionally since we now leverage this feature explicitly defining the `FLASK_ENV` environment, i.e., `FLASK_ENV=development flask run` is no longer required and thus I updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reflect this change. Finally given that `--reload` and `--debugger` are enabled by default per, \r\n\r\n```\r\n  --reload / --no-reload          Enable or disable the reloader.  By default\r\n                                  the reloader is active if debug is enabled.\r\n  --debugger / --no-debugger      Enable or disable the debugger.  By default\r\n                                  the debugger is active if debug is enabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\nthere's no need to explicitly specify them.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSorry for submitting PR without creating an issue first. It doesn't look like a big change but I can convert the issue and proposal into SIP if needed.\r\n\r\n#### The issue\r\nSQL Lab has Stop button but it only updates state of superset without actually stopping the database query.\r\nIn some cases complex query can run in background for days and affect database performance.\r\nThe issue especially affect us as we use Superset with [gitbase](http://github.com/src-d/gitbase) which speeks MySQL protocol.\r\n\r\n#### This commit solves the problem as following:\r\n\r\n1. Add new key `cancel_payload` into extra attribute of the Query instance.\r\n2. Add `get_cancel_query_payload` method to EngineSpec that returns some\r\npayload from the connection which allows to cancel it later.\r\n3. `execute_sql_statements` before executing queries retrieves and saves\r\ncancel payload into Query\r\n4. Stop handler calls new `cancel_query` method of EngineSpec\r\n\r\nBoth new methods are implemented only for MySQL for now but it is easy\r\nto add support for PostgreSQL, MSSQL and maybe some other DBs.\r\n\r\nFor MySQL I use `KILL CONNECTION` to terminate multiple statements.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative approach:\r\n\r\nMaintain list of open connections and close them on cancel.\r\nThis solutions looks cleaner but has some disadvantages:\r\n- would require big changes in the codebase\r\n- implementation would get very tricky in distributed mode\r\n- some drivers can keep query running even after `close()` call.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nRun complex log-running query with MySQL using SQL lab. Press stop. The query should be killed.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEven though this is a legacy portion of the app that is likely to go away one day, the FAB-managed templates still play a vital role to the application and some of its core features. When I set to fix a bug in a FAB-managed template, I could not get the template to refresh. \r\n\r\nI learned through a bit of head-wall-butting and searching that removing `--with-threads` from the run command might solve the problem due to a race condition. I don't have enough information to say that's exactly what's going on for sure, but removing `--with-threads` did result in my template pages being updated. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Make a change to a template file managed by FAB and check to see if the change is reflected, even after clearing your cache or browsing in incognito and start the app with:\r\n\r\n`FLASK_ENV=development superset run -p 8088 --with-threads --reload --debugger`\r\n\r\n2. Stop the server and try to start it again with this command:\r\n\r\nFLASK_ENV=development superset run -p 8088 --reload --debugger\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->          \r\n- [x] Has associated issue: \"Fixes

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEven though this is a legacy portion of the app that is likely to go away one day, the FAB-managed templates still play a vital role to the application and some of its core features. When I set to fix a bug in a FAB-managed template, I could not get the template to refresh. \r\n\r\nI learned through a bit of head-wall-butting and searching that removing `--with-threads` from the run command might solve the problem due to a race condition. I don't have enough information to say that's exactly what's going on for sure, but removing `--with-threads` did result in my template pages being updated. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Make a change to a template file managed by FAB and check to see if the change is reflected, even after clearing your cache or browsing in incognito and start the app with:\r\n\r\n`FLASK_ENV=development superset run -p 8088 --with-threads --reload --debugger`\r\n\r\n2. Stop the server and try to start it again with this command:\r\n\r\nFLASK_ENV=development superset run -p 8088 --reload --debugger\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

Because Sql Lab uses redux-localStorage to sync redux state to localStorage, any time an action is dispatched in redux it will trigger localStorage update (_even without any change_), which is very unnecessary when there is no real state change.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: i used redux chrome extension to show redux state

Each step has is simply a bar graph step with a specific query. Relationships are made between each step by printing the delta for story telling effect.\r\n![Steps](https://i.imgur.com/z6dCtj1.png)\r\n\r\n2) ABSOLUTE FILTER\r\nAbsolute Filter can be added on a slice as a whole for repetitive filters. For example if you are only interested in telling a story on domestic sales. You can apply the domestic_sales filter once in absolute filter instead of on every step.\r\n![Absolute Filter](https://i.imgur.com/Oth7I10.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nRun additional tests on the

Specifically per the [documentation](http://druid.io/docs/latest/querying/hll-old.html) the type should be `hyperUnique` when \r\n\r\n> ... that has been aggregated as a \"hyperUnique\" metric at indexing time.\r\n\r\nas opposed to `cardinality`. Both use HyperLogLog however the former is specific to Druid metrics which are of type `hyperUnique` (per the indexing aggregation) vs computing the cardinality of non-complex types.\r\n\r\n###

But when localStorage space is used up, browser may show error, or run very slow then crash.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to address this issue by following:\r\n- if existed query's `startDttm` > 24 hours, remove its query's `results` attribute from localStorage.\r\n- when they used up 90% of suggested limit, adding warning message to user.\r\nThe upper limit for localStorage varies by browser type (and version). From this discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2989284/what-is-the-max-size-of-localstorage-values\r\nI choose **5120KB** as limit. In my local test, Chrome can hold up to 10MB localStorage data. But when data size > 5MB, it runs really slow.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"506\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 1 43 45 PM\"

[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24956894/sql-alchemy-queuepool-limit-overflow). \r\n\r\nI've grokked the code an it seems everywhere we open a connection we explicitly close it (via `contextlib.closing`) except for the `/testconn` route. I'm not certain whether this is the cause of the issue, however we do call this route every 10 minutes and thus it seems like a viable candidate. \r\n\r\nNote additionally the `/testconn` route used to return the list of tables associated with the database which seems like overkill when as `SELECT 1` would be suffice. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST

CATEGORY\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR extends upon @kristw 's proof of concept that allows each visualization to define its own controls, instead of storing all controls in the centralized `controls.jsx` file. Shared controls defined in `controls.jsx` are still supported. Moving forward, we would want to create a registry for controls that are defined at the visualization level. This would allow us to move towards a modularized world where new charts can be installed and maintained as plugins, reducing bloat in our codebase. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![good_behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17525561/58120275-beb1cb80-7bb9-11e9-85bc-3a2706e27cae.gif)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17525561/58120692-9a0a2380-7bba-11e9-8568-8a806383e6ac.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerified that the `rose` chart modified in this PR is working correctly\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:\r\nThis PR uncovered an issue with the `vizType` form data property not being updated when you switch from one visualization to another (ex. Line to Rose, Rose to Pie, etc.). This has likely gone unnoticed because chart controls used to rely on the `controls.jsx` index -- not `vizType`. This new PR requires the correct `vizType` to be passed in so the correct control panel config can be identified and looked up against.\r\n\r\nThe UI implications of this bug are shown in the GIF below. Note that desired behavior is for `Use Area Proportions` checkbox control to trigger an automatic re-render.\r\n\r\n![bad_behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17525561/58120084-55ca5380-7bb9-11e9-9a60-46aff28e6353.gif)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17525561/58119855-d5a3ee00-7bb8-11e9-8695-55b39b370406.png)\r\n\r\n**[Update

above.\r\n![fixed_renderTrigger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17525561/63404763-554c7f00-c399-11e9-8900-9609f4c065f2.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@kristw @williaster

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7446#pullrequestreview-238146228 changed the polling mechanism to keep polling when a query succeeds but doesn't have a `resultsKey`, to work around a race condition in SQL Lab. @graceguo-supercat pointed out that synchronous queries **do not** have `resultsKey`, and when they run the frontend keeps polling the backend unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic so that the frontend keeps polling only for async queries that succeeded but don't have `resultsKeys` set.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nWithout this PR, this happens:\r\n\r\n1. Run a sync query in SQL Lab, wait for results.\r\n2. Create new tab, run async query.\r\n3. Browser keeps polling after async query finished, since the sync query from (1) has no `resultsKey`.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the browser stops polling once the async query finishes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAllow editing `schedule_info` in saved queries that have it.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit messy because I didn't want to completely replace the current CRUD provided by FAB for saved queries (since I believe this is already in the works). Instead, I modified the template to have a button for editing the schedule, and it updates the information and submits the FAB form.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![edit_schedule](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/58053554-bbacd180-7b0c-11e9-8f14-7a7ae48e3fb3.gif)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nTested locally.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the UI/UX when scheduling queries:\r\n\r\n- The message now says \"Your query has been scheduled. To see details of your query, navigate to Saved Queries\". Before we were hijacking the save dialog that simply said \"Your query has been saved.\"\r\n- The UI only allows queries to be scheduled after they've run successfully once. The user still can edit the query after (to insert a `ds` macro, eg) and schedule it.\r\n- The UI now prompts for the query name and a description.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n#6721 introduced the possibility to use time filters that end right now as opposed to midnight. However, this also made the start date reference the current time, leading to a moving window. While this might be fine for some use cases eg. line graphs with fine granularity, the full start day is often preferred in bar charts and similar; otherwise the start day will start dropping observations, as the day progresses. This PR introduces a new parameter `DEFAULT_RELATIVE_START_TIME`, which defaults to `today`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nAs can be seen below, when setting `DEFAULT_RELATIVE_END_TIME = 'now'`, the start date starts to drop off observations prior to the current time.\r\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"Screenshot 2019-05-16 at 13 57 03\"

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nI found a very strange corner case: some user didn't use sql lab for a long time, and they didn't have any old query tab in Sql Lab. When recently they started to use sql lab, their async query may stuck at pending state forever. From browser console I can see the query was sent to back end, but browser didn't start polling query results at all. So that even backend finished query, front end is still showing pending state. This issue can't be consistently reproduced, it only happened on few users, but those users are totally blocked and can't run any async queries successfully.\r\n\r\nAfter debug I found polling was stopped by this line:\r\n\r\n> return (\r\n      queriesLastUpdate > 0 &&\r\n      Object.values(queries).some(\r\n        q => isQueryRunning(q) &&\r\n        now - q.startDttm < MAX_QUERY_AGE_TO_POLL,\r\n      )\r\n    );\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those users got stuck at pending state, when sql lab was initialized, `queriesLastUpdate` was 0. There was a change for initial value introduced in #5896. `queriesLastUpdate` was set to 0 before this PR. So i am thinking probably those users' sql lab state was persisted into localStorage. And now they open sql lab with new code base that requires `queriesLastUpdate > 0`, then their sql lab can't poll anymore.\r\n\r\nI don't think  `queriesLastUpdate > 0` is really necessary for polling query results. So my solution for this issue is just remove this requirement.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nci and check with users stuck at pending state. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

Lab, ensuring that the end date doesn't come before the start date.\r\n\r\nIt also initializes the form with defaults. Ideally we want these to be relative dates, so I used the [Sugar](https://sugarjs.com/) library to parse human readable dates. For example, with this config:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            'start_date': {\r\n                'type': 'string',\r\n                'format': 'date-time',\r\n                'title': 'Start date',\r\n                'default': 'today at 9am',\r\n            },\r\n            'end_date': {\r\n                'type': 'string',\r\n                'format': 'date-time',\r\n                'title': 'End date',\r\n                'default': '9am in 30 days',\r\n            },\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"577\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-14 at 1 38 31 PM\"

rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen there are no filters active, to see the filter-less list of tables, you have to do a browser refresh. It would be helpful in the UI for some business users to be able to simply refresh with the search button, but it goes away. Search here is really refresh (usually with filters enabled), so it seems natural. \r\n\r\nThat is the main change here. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\ncannot get fab to update template. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nRefresh the template through re-initialization of the app and render the new table search page. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if
