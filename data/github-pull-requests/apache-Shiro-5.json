href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330\">#2330</a></li>\n<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332\">#2332</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>. ARM machines with SIP disabled, including the newest <code>macos-latest</code> image, are unsupported for CLI versions before 2.15.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2261\">#2261</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.2 - 22 Apr 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>.

Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded `isTerminal()` check to Hasher tool, as JDK 22 changed console functionality\r\nRun JDK 22 in CI\r\nfixes #1381 \r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2321\">#2321</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>. ARM machines with SIP disabled, including the newest <code>macos-latest</code> image, are unsupported for CLI versions before 2.15.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2261\">#2261</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.2 - 22 Apr 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.1 - 17 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in April/May 2024 that improves the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug where the <code>init</code> Action would fail if <code>--overwrite</code> was specified in <code>CODEQL_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTIONS</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2245\">#2245</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.0 - 15 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The deprecated feature for extracting dependencies for a Python analysis has been removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2224\">#2224</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

<code>InetAddress</code>-<code>String</code> conversion methods to preserve the IPv6 scope ID if present. The scope ID can be necessary for IPv6-capable devices with multiple network interfaces. However, preserving it can also lead to problems for callers that rely on the returned values <em>not</em> to include the scope ID:\n<ul>\n<li>Callers might compensate for the old behavior of the methods by appending the scope ID to a returned string themselves. If so, you can update your code to stop doing so at the same time as you upgrade Guava. Of, if your code might run against multiple versions of Guava, you can check whether Guava has included a scope ID before you add one yourself.</li>\n<li>Callers might pass the returned string to another system that does not understand scope IDs. If so, you can strip the scope ID off, whether by truncating the string form at a <code>%</code> character (leaving behind any trailing <code>]</code> character in the case of <code>forUriString</code>) or by replacing the returned <code>InetAddress</code> with a new instance constructed by calling <code>InetAddress.getByAddress(addr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>java.net.InetAddress</code> validates any provided scope ID against the interfaces available on the machine. As a result, methods in <code>InetAddresses</code> may now fail if the scope ID fails validation.\n<ul>\n<li>Notable cases in which this may happen include:\n<ul>\n<li>if the code runs in an Android app without networking permission</li>\n<li>if code passes <code>InetAddress</code> instances or strings across devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If this is not the behavior that you want, then you can strip off the scope ID from the input string before passing it to Guava, as discussed above.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.7 - 31 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May/June 2024 that will reduce the Actions cache usage of the Action by keeping only the newest TRAP cache for each language. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2306\">#2306</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.6 - 20 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>\n<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>.

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2295\">#2295</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.5 - 13 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a compatibility matrix of supported CodeQL Action, CodeQL CLI, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions to the <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md\">https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/README.md</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2273\">#2273</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing out a warning for a missing <code>on.push</code> trigger when the CodeQL Action is triggered via a <code>workflow_call</code> event. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2274\">#2274</a></li>\n<li>The <code>tools: latest</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action has been renamed to <code>tools: linked</code>. This option specifies that the Action should use the tools shipped at the same time as the Action. The old name will continue to work for backwards compatibility, but we recommend that new workflows use the new name. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2281\">#2281</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.4 - 08 May 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2270\">#2270</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.3 - 25 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2247\">#2247</a></li>\n<li>Workflows running on <code>macos-latest</code> using CodeQL CLI versions before v2.15.1 will need to either upgrade their CLI version to v2.15.1 or newer, or change the platform to an Intel MacOS runner, such as <code>macos-12</code>. ARM machines with SIP disabled, including the newest <code>macos-latest</code> image, are unsupported for CLI versions before 2.15.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2261\">#2261</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.2 - 22 Apr 2024</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.1 - 17 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in April/May 2024 that improves the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug where the <code>init</code> Action would fail if <code>--overwrite</code> was specified in <code>CODEQL_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTIONS</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2245\">#2245</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.0 - 15 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The deprecated feature for extracting dependencies for a Python analysis has been removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2224\">#2224</a></p>\n<p>As a result, the following inputs and environment variables are now ignored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>setup-python-dependencies</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action</li>\n<li>The <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION</code> environment variable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend removing any references to these from your workflows. For more information, see the release notes for CodeQL Action v3.23.0 and v2.23.0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automatically overwrite an existing database if found on the filesystem. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2229\">#2229</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2232\">#2232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A more relevant log message and a diagnostic are now emitted when the <code>file</code> program is not installed on a Linux runner, but is required for Go tracing to succeed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2234\">#2234</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.24.10 - 05 Apr 2024</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
