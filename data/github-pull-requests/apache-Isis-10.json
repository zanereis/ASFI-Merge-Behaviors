Evaluators\nare sorted by their relative execution cost, and executed in order of lower to higher cost. This speeds the\nmatching process by ensuring that simpler evaluations (such as a tag name match) are conducted prior to more\ncomplex evaluations (such as an attribute regex, or a deep child scan with a :has).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags (and their children). This includes tag namespaces and case\npreservation on applicable tags and attributes.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2008\">jhy/jsoup#2008</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, HTML documents will be placed in the\n<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace by default, per the HTML5 spec. This can be controlled by setting\n<code>W3CDom#namespaceAware(false)</code>.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1848\">jhy/jsoup#1848</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: speed optimized the Structural Evaluators by memoizing previous evaluations. Particularly the <code>~</code>\n(any preceding sibling) and <code>:nth-of-type</code> selectors are improved.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1956\">jhy/jsoup#1956</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of the Element nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling, firstElementSibling,\nlastElementSibling, firstElementChild, and lastElementChild. They now inplace filter/skip in the child-node list, vs\nhaving to allocate and scan a complete Element filtered list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: optimized internal methods that previously called Element.children() to use filter/skip child-node list\naccessors instead, reducing new Element List allocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of parsing :pseudo selectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when using the <code>:empty</code> pseudo-selector, blank textnodes are now considered empty. Previously,\nan element containing any whitespace was not considered empty.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1976\">jhy/jsoup#1976</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in forms, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> should be excluded from formData() (and hence from form submissions).\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2010\">jhy/jsoup#2010</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Safelist, made isSafeTag and isSafeAttribute public methods, for extensibility.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1780\">jhy/jsoup#1780</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: <code>form</code> elements and empty elements (such as <code>img</code>) did not have their attributes de-duplicated.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1950\">jhy/jsoup#1950</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if Document.OutputSettings was cloned from a clone, an NPE would be thrown when used.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1964\">jhy/jsoup#1964</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in Jsoup.connect(url), URL paths containing a %2B were incorrectly recoded to a '+', or a '+' was recoded\nto a ' '. Fixed by reverting to the previous behavior of not encoding supplied paths, other than normalizing to\nASCII.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952\">jhy/jsoup#1952</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

TestUtils.displayEmail to EmailOpener.displayEmail</p>\n<h2>Easy reordering of JSON for consistent approvals</h2>\n<h1>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>JSON does not define an order to the fields.<br />\nThis can make approving JSON inconsistent as ApprovalTests requires consistent results.</p>\n<h1>The Solution:</h1>\n<p><code>JsonApprovals.verifyJson(json)</code> now has an overload:<br />\n<code>JsonApprovals.verifyJson(json, reorderJson: true)</code><br />\nwhich will alphabetically sort the JSON in the result.\nBy default it still does not reorder the JSON.</p>\n<h1>Extras</h1>\n<p>You can call the reordering directly with<br />\n<code>JsonUtils.reorderFields(json)</code><br />\nThis fixes <a

TestUtils.displayEmail to EmailOpener.displayEmail</p>\n<h2>Easy reordering of JSON for consistent approvals</h2>\n<h1>The Problem:</h1>\n<p>JSON does not define an order to the fields.<br />\nThis can make approving JSON inconsistent as ApprovalTests requires consistent results.</p>\n<h1>The Solution:</h1>\n<p><code>JsonApprovals.verifyJson(json)</code> now has an overload:<br />\n<code>JsonApprovals.verifyJson(json, reorderJson: true)</code><br />\nwhich will alphabetically sort the JSON in the result.\nBy default it still does not reorder the JSON.</p>\n<h1>Extras</h1>\n<p>You can call the reordering directly with<br />\n<code>JsonUtils.reorderFields(json)</code><br />\nThis fixes <a

directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.) (f87f68cd3e)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Made <code>MediaType.parse</code> allow and skip over whitespace around the <code>/</code> and <code>=</code> separator tokens in addition to the <code>;</code> separator, for which it was already being allowed. (2786f83291)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Tweaked <code>Futures.getChecked</code> constructor-selection behavior: The method continues to prefer to call constructors with a <code>String</code> parameter, but now it breaks ties based on whether the constructor has a <code>Throwable</code> parameter. Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)

directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.) (f87f68cd3e)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Made <code>MediaType.parse</code> allow and skip over whitespace around the <code>/</code> and <code>=</code> separator tokens in addition to the <code>;</code> separator, for which it was already being allowed. (2786f83291)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Tweaked <code>Futures.getChecked</code> constructor-selection behavior: The method continues to prefer to call constructors with a <code>String</code> parameter, but now it breaks ties based on whether the constructor has a <code>Throwable</code> parameter. Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)

<strong>breaking change</strong>.</p>\n<p>When you call <code>Reporter.report(received, approved)</code> it now returns if it was successful.\nThis makes the java architecture more consistent with other implementations and allows us to determine when something should have worked but it didn't.</p>\n<p>It should not affect you unless you've written a custom implementation of <code>ApprovalFailureReporter</code>.</p>\n<p>Information on why and how to upgrade can be found <a

the minimum supported JDK from JDK 11 to JDK 17 in a future release of Error Prone, see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803\">#3803</a>. Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass <code>--release 11</code> to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.

Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass <code>--release 11</code> to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.
