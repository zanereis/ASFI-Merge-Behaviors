What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, spark would not release ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator until the whole task finished.In some conditions, it incurs memory leak.\r\n\r\nAn example is `rdd.repartition(m).coalesce(n, shuffle = false).save`, each `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` contains  some metas about mapStatus(`blocksByAddress`) and each resultTask will keep n(max to shuffle partitions) shuffleBlockFetcherIterator and the memory would never released until the task completion, for they are referenced by the completion callbacks of TaskContext. In some case, it may take huge memory and incurs OOM.\r\n\r\nActually, We can release ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator as soon as it's consumed.\r\nThis PR is to resolve this problem.\r\n\r\n## How was

on some woker nodes (for example, bad disk or disk has no capacity), the application executor will be allocated indefinitely.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the spark worker is started, the workerdir is created successfully. When the application is submitted, the disks mounted by the workerdir and worker122 workerdir are damaged.\r\n\r\nWhen a worker allocates an executor, it creates a working directory and a temporary directory. If the creation fails, the executor allocation fails. The application directory fails to be created on the SPARK_WORKER_DIR on woker121 and worker122，the application executor will be allocated indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI added two configuration items, spark.deploy.executorFailedPerWorkerThreshold and spark.worker.black.timeout. Record the number of times the woker fails to allocate an executor to the same application. The maximum value is controlled by spark.deploy.executorFailedPerWorkerThreshold. It is determined whether the worker can be set to black.  And the worker black will be removed by configuring the timeout period.\r\n\r\nMaster will judge whether the worker is available according to the resources of the worker and whether the worker is black. \r\n\r\n    // Filter out workers that don't have enough resources to launch an executor\r\n    val usableWorkers = workers.toArray.filter(_.state == WorkerState.ALIVE)\r\n    .filter(worker => worker.memoryFree >= app.desc.memoryPerExecutorMB &&\r\n    worker.coresFree >= coresPerExecutor && !worker.isBlack)\r\n    .sortBy(_.coresFree).reverse\r\n\r\nThis is a solution I can think of, I don’t know if it’s suitable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n manual tests\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(courtesy of liancheng)\r\n\r\nSpark SQL supports both global aggregation and grouping aggregation. Global aggregation always return a single row with the initial aggregation state as the output, even there are zero input rows. Spark implements this by simply checking the number of grouping keys and treats an aggregation as a global aggregation if it has zero grouping keys.\r\n\r\nHowever, this simple principle drops the ball in the following case:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates().agg(count($\"*\") as \"c\").show()\r\n// +---+\r\n// | c |\r\n// +---+\r\n// | 1 |\r\n// +---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that:\r\n\r\n1. `df.dropDuplicates()` is roughly translated into something equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval allColumns = df.columns.map { col }\r\ndf.groupBy(allColumns: _*).agg(allColumns.head, allColumns.tail: _*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis translation is implemented in the rule `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate`.\r\n\r\n2. `spark.emptyDataFrame` contains zero columns and zero rows.\r\n\r\nTherefore, rule `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` makes a confusing transformation roughly equivalent to the following one:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates()\r\n=> spark.emptyDataFrame.groupBy().agg(Map.empty[String, String])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above transformation is confusing because the resulting aggregate operator contains no grouping keys (because `emptyDataFrame` contains no columns), and gets recognized as a global aggregation. As a result, Spark SQL allocates a single row filled by the initial aggregation state and uses it as the output, and returns a wrong result.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR tweaks `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` by appending a literal `1` to the grouping key list of the resulting `Aggregate` operator when the input plan contains zero output columns. In this way, `spark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates()` is now translated into a grouping aggregation, roughly depicted as:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates()\r\n=> spark.emptyDataFrame.groupBy(lit(1)).agg(Map.empty[String, String])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is now properly treated as a grouping aggregation and returns the correct answer.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added","created_at":"2019-01-03T04:40:07Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T18:21:37Z","closed_at":"2019-01-03T18:21:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b68f7947a68bab901a365082e0e5cb5519f03e3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a23dfb7dcf8805c3d6d5cbc2b5390a7f38076a02","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-22951-2","ref":"SPARK-22951-2","sha":"a23dfb7dcf8805c3d6d5cbc2b5390a7f38076a02","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-2.2","ref":"branch-2.2","sha":"6f435e9f76a389ea1cbd65fd5a629ebff9c6b229","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile obtaining token from hbase service , spark uses deprecated API of hbase ,\r\n```public static Token<AuthenticationTokenIdentifier> obtainToken(Configuration conf)```\r\nThis deprecated API is already been removed from hbase 2.x version as part of the hbase 2.x major release. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14713_\r\nthere is one more stable API in \r\n```public static Token<AuthenticationTokenIdentifier> obtainToken(Connection conn)``` in TokenUtil class\r\nspark shall use this stable api for getting the delegation token.\r\n\r\nTo invoke this api first connection object has to be retrieved from ConnectionFactory and the same connection can be passed to obtainToken(Connection conn) for getting token.\r\neg: Call   ```public static Connection createConnection(Configuration conf)```\r\n, then call   ```public static Token<AuthenticationTokenIdentifier> obtainToken( Connection conn)```.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing is been done.\r\nManual test result:\r\nBefore fix:\r\n\r\n![hbase-dep-obtaintok 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/50699264-64cac200-106d-11e9-81b4-e50ae8097f27.png)\r\n\r\nAfter fix:\r\n1. Create 2 tables in hbase shell\r\n >Launch hbase shell\r\n >Enter commands to create tables and load data\r\n    create 'table1','cf'\r\n    put 'table1','row1','cf:cid','20'\r\n\r\n    create

as 30\r\n   \r\n   \r\n2.Run SparkHbasetoHbase class in testSpark.jar using spark-submit\r\n\r\nspark-submit --master yarn-cluster --class com.mrs.example.spark.SparkHbasetoHbase --conf \"spark.yarn.security.credentials.hbase.enabled\"=\"true\" --conf \"spark.security.credentials.hbase.enabled\"=\"true\" --keytab /opt/client/user.keytab --principal sen testSpark.jar\r\n\r\nThe SparkHbasetoHbase test class will update the value of table2 with sum of values of table1 & table2.\r\n\r\ntable2 = table1+table2\r\nAs we can see in the snapshot the spark job has been successfully

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen acquiring unroll memory from `StaticMemoryManager`, let it fail fast if required space exceeds memory limit, just like acquiring storage memory. \r\nI think this may reduce some computation and memory evicting costs especially when required space(`numBytes`) is very big.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Java 9+ we can't use sun.misc.Cleaner by default anymore, and this was largely handled in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22993 However I think the change there left a significant problem.\r\n\r\nIf a DirectByteBuffer is allocated using the reflective hack in Platform, now, we by default can't set a Cleaner. But I believe this means the memory isn't freed promptly or possibly at all. If a Cleaner can't be set, I think we need to use normal APIs to allocate the direct ByteBuffer.\r\n\r\nAccording to comments in the code, the downside is simply that the normal APIs will check and impose limits on how much off-heap memory can be allocated. Per the original review on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22993 this much seems fine, as either way in this case the user would have to add a JVM setting (increase max, or allow the reflective access).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. This resolved an OutOfMemoryError in Java 11 from TimSort tests without increasing test heap size. (See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23419#issuecomment-450772125 ) This suggests there is a problem and that this resolves it.","created_at":"2019-01-02T04:27:19Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T21:38:10Z","closed_at":"2019-01-04T21:38:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6085dd8b6f9b1350b6f94325fb6a05e7cdf3996","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82a887c8e8591f040582f3bb5f23c91891d1beab","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-24421.2","ref":"SPARK-24421.2","sha":"82a887c8e8591f040582f3bb5f23c91891d1beab","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDefault timestamp pattern defined in `JSONOptions` doesn't allow saving/loading timestamps with time zones of seconds precision. Because of that, the round trip test failed for timestamps before 1582. In the PR, I propose to extend zone offset section from `XXX` to `XXXXX` which should allow to save/load zone offsets like `-07:52:48`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by `JsonHadoopFsRelationSuite` and `TimestampFormatterSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-30T19:17:59Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:36:02Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T00:03:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f535a089c5dded6f15ab2ad60898e6866dca99d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23417/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23417/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23417/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/731b383567752290df9af8af7e90a68fd9752833","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:hadoopfsrelationtest-new-formatter","ref":"hadoopfsrelationtest-new-formatter","sha":"731b383567752290df9af8af7e90a68fd9752833","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR makes hardcoded spark.driver, spark.executor, and spark.cores.max configs to use `ConfigEntry`.\r\n\r\nNote that some config keys are from `SparkLauncher` instead of defining in the config package object because the string is already defined in it and it does not depend on core module.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProposed new class `StringConcat` for converting a sequence of strings to string with one memory allocation in the `toString` method.  `StringConcat` replaces `StringBuilderWriter` in methods of dumping of Spark plans and codegen to strings.\r\n\r\nAll `Writer` arguments are replaced by `String => Unit` in methods related to Spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Trigger GC on executor node idle \r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\r\n### Stage\r\nOn a large cluster, each stage would have some executors. were a few executors would finish a couple of tasks first and wait for whole stage or remaining tasks to finish which are executed by different executors nodes in a cluster. a stage will only be completed when all tasks in a current stage finish its execution. and the next stage execution has to wait till all tasks of the current stage are completed. \r\n\r\nwhy don't we trigger GC, when the executor node is waiting for remaining tasks to finish, or when executor node is Idle?\r\n\r\nI have proposed a small code snippet which triggers GC when running-tasks are empty and heap usage in current executor node is more than the given threshold.\r\n\r\nThis could improve performance for long-running spark job's. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current `SelectedField` extractor is somewhat complicated and it seems to be handling cases that should be handled automatically:\r\n\r\n- `GetArrayItem(child: GetStructFieldObject())`\r\n- `GetArrayStructFields(child: GetArrayStructFields())`\r\n- `GetMap(value: GetStructFieldObject())`\r\n\r\nThis PR removes those cases and simplifies the extractor by passing down the data type instead of a field.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen creating some unsafe projections, Spark rebuilds the map of schema attributes once for each expression in the projection. Some file format readers create one unsafe projection per input file, others create one per task. ProjectExec also creates one unsafe projection per task. As a result, for wide queries on wide tables, Spark might build the map of schema attributes hundreds of thousands of times.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes two functions to reuse the same AttributeSeq instance when creating BoundReference objects for each expression in the projection. This avoids the repeated rebuilding of the map of schema attributes.\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\nThe time saved by this PR depends on size of the schema, size of the projection, number of input files (or number of file splits), number of tasks, and file format. I chose a couple of example cases.\r\n\r\nIn the following tests, I ran the query\r\n```sql\r\nselect * from table where id1 = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nMatching rows are about 0.2% of the table.\r\n\r\n#### Orc table 6000 columns, 500K rows, 34 input files\r\n\r\nbaseline | pr | improvement\r\n----|----|----\r\n1.772306 min | 1.487267 min | 16.082943%\r\n\r\n#### Orc table 6000 columns, 500K rows, *17* input files\r\n\r\nbaseline | pr | improvement\r\n----|----|----\r\n 1.656400 min | 1.423550 min | 14.057595%\r\n\r\n#### Orc table 60 columns, 50M rows, 34 input files\r\n\r\nbaseline | pr | improvement\r\n----|----|----\r\n0.299878 min | 0.290339 min | 3.180926%\r\n\r\n#### Parquet table 6000 columns, 500K rows, 34 input files\r\n\r\nbaseline | pr | improvement\r\n----|----|----\r\n1.478306 min | 1.373728 min | 7.074165%\r\n\r\nNote: The parquet reader does not create an unsafe projection. However, the filter operation in the query causes the planner to add a ProjectExec, which does create an unsafe projection for each task. So these results have nothing to do with Parquet itself.\r\n\r\n#### Parquet table 60 columns, 50M rows, 34 input files\r\n\r\nbaseline | pr | improvement\r\n----|----|----\r\n0.245006 min | 0.242200

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to switch on `TimestampFormatter`/`DateFormatter` in casting dates/timestamps to strings. The changes should make the date/timestamp casting consistent to JSON/CSV datasources and time-related functions like `to_date`, `to_unix_timestamp`/`from_unixtime`.\r\n\r\nLocal formatters are moved out from `DateTimeUtils` to where they are actually used. It allows to avoid re-creation of new formatter instance per-each call. Another reason is to have separate parser for `PartitioningUtils` because default parsing pattern cannot be used (expected optional section `[.S]`).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `CastSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23043 , we introduced a behavior change: Spark users are not able to distinguish 0.0 and -0.0 anymore.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes an alternative fix to the original bug, to retain the difference between 0.0 and -0.0 inside Spark.\r\n\r\nThe idea is, we can rewrite the window partition key, join key and grouping key during logical phase, to normalize the special floating numbers. Thus only operators care about special floating numbers need to pay the perf overhead, and end users can distinguish -0.0.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

the required partition column values only.\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23383 . As @cloud-fan suggested, create a new PR to make review easier.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR doesn't improve `OrcFileFormat`, since in the method `buildReaderWithPartitionValues`, the `requiredSchema` filter out all the partition columns, so we can't know which partition column is required.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

The main idea is to make css style class name match the corresponding stage status.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested locally. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// active/complete stage\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 3, 3).map { n => Thread.sleep(10* 1000); n }.count\r\n// failed stage\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 3, 3).map { n => Thread.sleep(10* 1000); throw new Exception() }.count\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote we need to clear browser cache to let new `timeline-view.css` take effect.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCreate a framework for file source V2 based on data source V2 API.  \r\nAs a good example for demonstrating the framework, this PR also migrate ORC source. This is because ORC file source supports both row scan and columnar scan, and the implementation is simpler comparing with Parquet.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently only read path of V2 API is done, this framework and migration are only for the read path.\r\nSupports the following scan:\r\n- Scan ColumnarBatch\r\n- Scan UnsafeRow\r\n- Push down filters \r\n- Push down required columns\r\n\r\nNot supported( due to the limitation of data source V2 API):\r\n- Stats metrics\r\n- Catalog table\r\n- Writes\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark running on kubernetes now starts driver pod in Pod kind by default , which has a problem that entire job fails when  host machine crashs. In other words , driver pod can not failover in kind of Pod in this situation.  So , we add kind configuration of driver pod which supports Pod、Deployment、Job. For example , in streaming jobs , starting driver pod in Deployment kind will ensure  the driver service high available even there is host-machine-crash. In batch jobs , there is configurable backoffLimits for retry.   \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nWe test in production env. Starting driver in Deployment or Job kind can make driver high available when host machine crashs.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-26T04:04:10Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T23:58:10Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T23:58:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0df0841245bf827216134739d0114c103087840b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ebc4fc2cca56cd2e2aba10c96eacbdfda9823246","head":{"label":"fhan688:driver_pod_type","ref":"driver_pod_type","sha":"ebc4fc2cca56cd2e2aba10c96eacbdfda9823246","user":{"login":"fhan688","id":5745228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5745228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688","html_url":"https://github.com/fhan688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102328495,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIzMjg0OTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"fhan688/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhan688","id":5745228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDUyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5745228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688","html_url":"https://github.com/fhan688","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhan688/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhan688/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTask CPU time was added since [SPARK-12221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12221). However, total CPU time across all tasks is not displayed on stage pages. This could be used to check whether a stage is CPU intensive or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR lets total CPU time across all tasks showed on stage pages.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Barrier TaskSet has a hard requirement that tasks can only be launched\r\nin a single resourceOffers round with enough slots(or sufficient resources), but\r\ncan not be guaranteed even if with enough slots due to task locality delay scheduling.\r\nSo, it is very likely that Barrier TaskSet gets a chunk of sufficient resources after\r\nall the trouble, but let it go easily just because one of pending tasks can not be\r\nscheduled. Futhermore, it causes severe resource competition between TaskSets and jobs\r\nand introduce unclear semantic for DynamicAllocation.\r\n\r\nThis pr trys to introduce WorkerOffer reservation mechanism for Barrier TaskSet, which\r\nallows Barrier TaskSet to reserve WorkerOffer in each resourceOffers round, and launch\r\ntasks at the same time once it accumulate the sufficient resource. In this way, we \r\nrelax the requirement of resources for the Barrier TaskSet. \r\n\r\nBesides, we have two features along with  WorkerOffer reservation mechanism:\r\n\r\n* To avoid the deadlock which may be introuduced by serveral Barrier TaskSets holding the reserved WorkerOffers for a long time, we'll ask Barrier TaskSets to force releasing part of reserved WorkerOffers\r\non demand. So, it is highly possible that each Barrier TaskSet would be launched in the end.\r\n\r\n* Barrier TaskSet could replace old high level locality reserved WorkerOffer with new low level locality WorkerOffer during the time it wating for sufficient resources, to perform better locality at the end.\r\n\r\nTo integrate with DynamicAllocation:\r\n\r\nThe possible effective way I can imagine is that adding new event, e.g. \r\nExecutorReservedEvent, ExecutorReleasedEvent, which behaved like busy executor with\r\nrunning tasks or idle executor without running tasks. Thus, ExecutorAllocationManager \r\nwould not let the executor go if it reminds of there're some reserved resource on that\r\nexecutor.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisted and added some, needs to add more.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-25T13:48:03Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T14:38:22Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T15:14:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45397d33b3be4c067bbf7afd9ccb81df6e8d3b21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23377/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23377/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23377/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/574f05268be4bdfe5be2d10fab0d08bb4e0545dd","head":{"label":"Ngone51:dev-introduce-WorkerOffer-reservation-mechanism-for-barrier-taskset","ref":"dev-introduce-WorkerOffer-reservation-mechanism-for-barrier-taskset","sha":"574f05268be4bdfe5be2d10fab0d08bb4e0545dd","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `ReplaceExceptWithFilter` we do not consider properly the case in which the condition returns NULL. Indeed, in that case, since negating NULL still returns NULL, so it is not true the assumption that negating the condition returns all the rows which didn't satisfy it, rows returning NULL may not be returned. This happens when constraints inferred by `InferFiltersFromConstraints` are not enough, as it happens with `OR` conditions.\r\n\r\nThe rule had also problems with non-deterministic conditions: in such a scenario, this rule would change the probability of the output.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes these problem by:\r\n - returning False for the condition when it is Null (in this way we do return all the rows which didn't satisfy it);\r\n - avoiding any transformation when the condition is non-deterministic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded UTs\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-22T11:52:07Z","updated_at":"2018-12-23T23:22:34Z","closed_at":"2018-12-23T00:11:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a4c3d53fdc5da6eb9fdafa6c40407988b516296","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/48a52a25c8f43e7bbf2a15bf1892ff9f161fd83e","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-26366_2.3_2","ref":"SPARK-26366_2.3_2","sha":"48a52a25c8f43e7bbf2a15bf1892ff9f161fd83e","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to switch the `DateFormatClass`, `ToUnixTimestamp`, `FromUnixTime`, `UnixTime` on java.time API for parsing/formatting dates and timestamps. The API has been already implemented by the `Timestamp`/`DateFormatter` classes. One of benefit is those classes support parsing timestamps with microsecond precision. Old behaviour can be switched on via SQL config: `spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled` (`false` by default).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by existing test suites - `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite`, `JsonSuite`, `CsvSuite`, `SQLQueryTestSuite` as well as PySpark tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-20T22:22:55Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:54Z","closed_at":"2018-12-27T03:13:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0c7f567ff252d0a13fa6d5542acb524aeea8565","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e1afc3f893529c579c737702b42af1d31f5bd63","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:new-time-cast","ref":"new-time-cast","sha":"0e1afc3f893529c579c737702b42af1d31f5bd63","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently,  even if I explicitly disable Hive support in SparkR session as below:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nsparkSession <- sparkR.session(\"local[4]\",

fork:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unrecognized Hadoop major version number: 3.1.1.3.1.0.0-78\r\n\tat

that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSparkSession.hiveClassesArePresent\r\n```\r\n\r\ncheck if the class is loadable or not to check if that's in classpath but `org.apache.hadoop.hive.conf.HiveConf` has a check for Hadoop version as static logic which is executed right away. This throws an `IllegalArgumentException` and that's not caught:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/36edbac1c8337a4719f90e4abd58d38738b2e1fb/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession.scala#L1113-L1121\r\n\r\nSo, currently, if users have a Hive built-in Spark with unsupported Hadoop version by our fork (namely 3+), there's no way to use SparkR even though it could work.\r\n\r\nThis PR just propose to change the order of bool comparison so that we can don't execute `SparkSession.hiveClassesArePresent` when:\r\n\r\n  1. `enableHiveSupport` is explicitly disabled\r\n  2. `spark.sql.catalogImplementation` is `in-memory`\r\n\r\nso that we **only** check `SparkSession.hiveClassesArePresent` when Hive support is explicitly enabled by short circuiting.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to write a test since we don't run tests against Hadoop 3 yet. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21588. Manually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code path,  `OneForOneStreamManager` holds `StreamState` in a Map named `streams`. \r\n\r\nA `StreamState` is initialized and put into `streams` when `OpenBlocks` request received.\r\nOne specific `StreamState` is removed from streams in two scenarios below:\r\n1. The last chunk of a stream is fetched\r\n2. The connection of `ChunkFetchRequest` is closed\r\n\r\n`StreamState` will never be clean up, if `OpenBlocks` request is received without any following  `ChunkFetchRequest`. This will cause memory leak in server side, which is harmful for long running service such as `ExternalShuffleService`.\r\n\r\nThis PR associates `StreamState` with channel when handle `OpenBlocks` request, because `OpenBlocks` request and following `ChunkFetchRequest`s for a specific stream are sent from the same `TransportClient` in `OneForOneBlockFetcher`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test

Additionally the Kafka integration has been using it \r\nsince Spark 2.1.0.\r\n\r\nBecause structured streaming general availability was announced in \r\nSpark 2.2.0, I suspect there are other

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SQLConf` is supposed to be serializable. However, currently it is not  serializable in `WithTestConf`. `WithTestConf` uses the method `overrideConfs` in closure, while the classes which implements it (`TestHiveSessionStateBuilder` and `TestSQLSessionStateBuilder`) are not serializable.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to use a local variable to fix it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `ReplaceExceptWithFilter` we do not consider properly the case in which the condition returns NULL. Indeed, in that case, since negating NULL still returns NULL, so it is not true the assumption that negating the condition returns all the rows which didn't satisfy it, rows returning NULL may not be returned. This happens when constraints inferred by `InferFiltersFromConstraints` are not enough, as it happens with `OR` conditions.\r\n\r\nThe rule had also problems with non-deterministic conditions: in such a scenario, this rule would change the probability of the output.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes these problem by:\r\n - returning False for the condition when it is Null (in this way we do return all the rows which didn't satisfy it);\r\n - avoiding any transformation when the condition is non-deterministic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, SQL configs are not propagated to executors while schema inferring in CSV datasource. For example, changing of `spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled` does not impact on inferring timestamp types. In the PR, I propose to fix the issue by wrapping schema inferring action using `SQLExecution.withSQLConfPropagated`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded logging to `TimestampFormatter`:\r\n```patch\r\n-object TimestampFormatter {\r\n+object TimestampFormatter extends Logging {\r\n   def apply(format: String, timeZone: TimeZone, locale: Locale): TimestampFormatter = {\r\n     if (SQLConf.get.legacyTimeParserEnabled) {\r\n+      logError(\"LegacyFallbackTimestampFormatter is being used\")\r\n       new LegacyFallbackTimestampFormatter(format, timeZone, locale)\r\n     } else {\r\n+      logError(\"Iso8601TimestampFormatter is being used\")\r\n       new Iso8601TimestampFormatter(format, timeZone, locale)\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nand run the command in `spark-shell`:\r\n```shell\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> Seq(\"2010|10|10\").toDF.repartition(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").text(\"/tmp/foo\")\r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").option(\"header\", \"false\").option(\"timestampFormat\", \"yyyy|MM|dd\").csv(\"/tmp/foo\").printSchema()\r\n18/12/18 10:47:27 ERROR TimestampFormatter: LegacyFallbackTimestampFormatter is being used\r\nroot\r\n |-- _c0: timestamp (nullable =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a small clean up.\r\n\r\nBy design catalyst rules should be orthogonal: each rule should have its own responsibility. However, the `ColumnPruning` rule does not only do column pruning, but also remove no-op project and window.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the `RemoveRedundantProject` rule to remove no-op window as well, and clean up the `ColumnPruning` rule to only do column pruning.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting
