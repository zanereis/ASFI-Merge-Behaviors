quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\nFor more information: [Hessian2Optimize](https://github.com/LinShunKang/dubbo-benchmark/blob/master/benchmark_results/Hessian2Optimize.md)\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-19T13:33:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T02:42:22Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T02:42:22Z","merged_at":"2020-04-07T02:42:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"78d527788d6fdc2d27e33261299f20db65f74139","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b03767aa02b9834b20f277de4df7e9d1c10d3a38","head":{"label":"LinShunKang:performance/reduce_object_allocation_v6","ref":"performance/reduce_object_allocation_v6","sha":"b03767aa02b9834b20f277de4df7e9d1c10d3a38","user":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222932918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI5MzI5MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LinShunKang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lin

What is the purpose of the change\r\nto fix some concurrency problems\r\n\r\n### RpcStatus.java\r\nIn some extreme cases, incrementAndGet and decrementAndGet will cause the method \r\n\"beginCount\" to returen incorrectly\r\nif max is 10, active is 10 now，here are 3 thread, thread-b calls the metod 'endCount' to decrease the active\r\n```\r\nthread-a\tthread-b\tthread-c\tactive's

\t--------\t failed \t\r\n```\r\nboth a and c failed, but active's value is 9 now, it's less than max\r\n\r\n### RoundRobinLoadBalance.java\r\nlet's look at this situation:\r\nthere are two thread A and B, A copied the old map to an new map, B put a new WeightedRoundRobin into the old map, and go on to try to get lock, it will failed becuase A hold the lock now, A replace the old map with new map. So the new WeightedRoundRobin object was lost!\r\n\r\nConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe, includes its iterator, it's OK to remove items in original map.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- replace increase and decrease with CAS loop\r\n\r\n- use 'computeIfAbsent' to replace 'get-create-putIfAbsent-get'\r\n\r\n- remove 'updateLock'\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nit's obvious\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-17T18:19:40Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T02:43:23Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T02:43:22Z","merged_at":"2020-04-07T02:43:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"317e62f73fd0a9bac4b34eb8b2c31bbae591ef91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a33a3ef5314eae43afb9f500e1959b0043988556","head":{"label":"trytocatch:master","ref":"master","sha":"a33a3ef5314eae43afb9f500e1959b0043988556","user":{"login":"trytocatch","id":6704992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDQ5OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6704992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch","html_url":"https://github.com/trytocatch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248024745,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDgwMjQ3NDU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"trytocatch/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trytocatch","id":6704992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDQ5OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6704992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch","html_url":"https://github.com/trytocatch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trytocatch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trytocatch/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-17T15:27:50Z","updated_at":"2020-04-14T03:40:07Z","closed_at":"2020-04-14T03:40:07Z","merged_at":"2020-04-14T03:40:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"afa2dc9a1ea2cd8e3cb292a47e7fc34f2acca036","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5ce4f5d99abdcbddc07d379fefe38f24b315a69a","head":{"label":"LinShunKang:performance/reduce_object_allocation_v5","ref":"performance/reduce_object_allocation_v5","sha":"5ce4f5d99abdcbddc07d379fefe38f24b315a69a","user":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222932918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI5MzI5MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LinShunKang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-17T02:45:28Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T14:46:16Z","closed_at":"2020-03-28T15:44:05Z","merged_at":"2020-03-28T15:44:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"40be2972e326c816a154e4dec7dea1a3fc625a2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53f8bc71db11d41d3eb690c3398c227d73a99676","head":{"label":"huangdx0726:fix5876","ref":"fix5876","sha":"53f8bc71db11d41d3eb690c3398c227d73a99676","user":{"login":"huangdx0726","id":29513837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTEzODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29513837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726","html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":199995147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTk5OTUxNDc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"huangdx0726/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huangdx0726","id":29513837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTEzODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29513837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726","html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\npolish remove some unused exception\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-14T16:44:39Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T16:44:56Z","closed_at":"2020-03-14T16:44:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e7b7050b6dd69188e1956b4ce5c9db21300bc97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5c989dd04f19adc88c832e88982d13ab901b7df8","head":{"label":"xiantang:remove-unused-exception","ref":"remove-unused-exception","sha":"5c989dd04f19adc88c832e88982d13ab901b7df8","user":{"login":"xiantang","id":34479567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDc5NTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34479567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiantang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246262528,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYyNjI1Mjg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xiantang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiantang","id":34479567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDc5NTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34479567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiantang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiantang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiantang/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-13T12:06:27Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T13:52:13Z","closed_at":"2020-03-13T13:52:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29a2fd929eceb5ec527e70d96c7065e8cfb06f07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b4189b059e65b6e0d5ae2dc0a2f1480a5e1bec6d","head":{"label":"Hinsteny:master","ref":"master","sha":"b4189b059e65b6e0d5ae2dc0a2f1480a5e1bec6d","user":{"login":"Hinsteny","id":5526657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjY2NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5526657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny","html_url":"https://github.com/Hinsteny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hinsteny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f8b8b3d2ee6d97f9771411a0fdab3f5701c1fc32","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #5855 \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\ndelete `finalizerGuardian`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-13T07:26:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T11:38:08Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T11:38:04Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T11:38:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e07686047404ed4729ab1af481fa14984d5ed2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d56100ec45c0f6299c4090571c4521102752adde","head":{"label":"lkj41110:fix#5855","ref":"fix#5855","sha":"d56100ec45c0f6299c4090571c4521102752adde","user":{"login":"lkj41110","id":18658843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110","html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":128875781,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjg4NzU3ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"lkj41110/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lkj41110","id":18658843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjU4ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110","html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lkj41110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lkj41110/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\npolish README.md  , make sure hyperlink can jump to dubbo-samples  Instead of 404\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-13T02:37:02Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T14:27:21Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T06:21:16Z","merged_at":"2020-03-27T06:21:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"9bd5152348e35359e762435cf64d7273ab22d757","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e46662d4032f0903e1b9c1bbd16b1a256a9b8252","head":{"label":"Huangxuny1:huangxunyi/polish_readme","ref":"huangxunyi/polish_readme","sha":"e46662d4032f0903e1b9c1bbd16b1a256a9b8252","user":{"login":"Huangxuny1","id":21981606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTgxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21981606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1","html_url":"https://github.com/Huangxuny1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"61d1ba78f7417c7088a5b71e36bec5a668f9b558","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn `AsyncToSyncInvoker`, when `ExecutionException` happens, only `TimeoutException` and `RemotingException` are handled and wrapped as `RpcException` and re-throw. The problem here is other exception will be swallowed silently.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nwrap other exception in `RpcException` and rethrow.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-11T07:24:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T09:33:12Z","closed_at":"2020-03-11T09:33:12Z","merged_at":"2020-03-11T09:33:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"61d1ba78f7417c7088a5b71e36bec5a668f9b558","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"qinliujie","id":8599441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8599441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie","html_url":"https://github.com/qinliujie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/32c22695b7a49b350a6160260d09f5e5a269e823","head":{"label":"beiwei30:async-to-sync-invoker-exception","ref":"async-to-sync-invoker-exception","sha":"32c22695b7a49b350a6160260d09f5e5a269e823","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206990449,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY5OTA0NDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"beiwei30/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30/dubbo","description":"Apache

in demo codes\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

issue: #5842 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix wrong comment with DubboBootstrap.useRegistryAsConfigCenterIfNecessary\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nOriginal comment mentioned \"For compatibility purpose, use registry as the default config center when the registry protocol is zookeeper and there's no config center specified explicitly.\".\r\nHowever, it seems this method works ignore the registry protocol because it use registry as the default config when I use nacos as registry protocol.\r\nI debugged this method and found out this method will use registry as the default config when there's no config center specified explicitly and useAsConfigCenter of registryConfig is null or true. So I modified this comment.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll test cases work fine.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-08T13:39:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T12:56:14Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T12:56:14Z","merged_at":"2020-03-10T12:56:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3e78c2e37091a99a5696bc450f49178d87b6fe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5840/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5840/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5840/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/26e81ce8ac075753a47df3c7a95352fed23cd04f","head":{"label":"candyleer:master","ref":"master","sha":"26e81ce8ac075753a47df3c7a95352fed23cd04f","user":{"login":"candyleer","id":11530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer","html_url":"https://github.com/candyleer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64405295,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDQwNTI5NQ==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"candyleer/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"candyleer","id":11530760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTMwNzYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11530760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer","html_url":"https://github.com/candyleer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candyleer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/candyleer/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-06T07:10:19Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T08:11:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T08:11:15Z","merged_at":"2021-04-12T08:11:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c291f82c0813c12b1268b97060f0a26d17255ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Issue: #5827 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-28T15:33:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-07T08:08:13Z","closed_at":"2020-03-07T08:08:13Z","merged_at":"2020-03-07T08:08:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3fb25282378271bb2b2b81d3a9e0e1e9446bbb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5812/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5812/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5812/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7e21da55aa1b16c8bf55861cfb20e1172d645690","head":{"label":"xylsh:extensionloader","ref":"extensionloader","sha":"7e21da55aa1b16c8bf55861cfb20e1172d645690","user":{"login":"xylsh","id":5275930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzU5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh","html_url":"https://github.com/xylsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":243791980,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDM3OTE5ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xylsh/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xylsh","id":5275930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzU5MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5275930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh","html_url":"https://github.com/xylsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xylsh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xylsh/dubbo","description":"Apache

Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-26T15:00:52Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T10:33:21Z","closed_at":"2020-02-29T10:33:20Z","merged_at":"2020-02-29T10:33:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"35e80b0c35de3f4b6f8e0405b574c32d46100b29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2c5177bdf0a4543271d84e9c61202f523f43b08a","head":{"label":"LiosWong:duplicate_condition","ref":"duplicate_condition","sha":"2c5177bdf0a4543271d84e9c61202f523f43b08a","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0f4e60dca31737ea905306b1c4a3cce399536db9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Issue: #5781 \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nOnce we are going to extend the serialization, write direct to Hessian InputStream/OutputStream is high efficient on the memroy. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nCurrently, the InputStream/OutputStream is not exported. The change is going to export the InputStream/OutputStream from Hessian2ObjectInput and Hessian2ObjectOutput.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate final Hessian2ObjectOutput delegate;\r\n\r\nprotected ProtobufObjectOutput(OutputStream os) {\r\n  this.delegate = new Hessian2ObjectOutput(os);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid writeBytesForPBObject(Object obj, Class clazz) throws IOException {\r\n  try (OutputStream os = delegate.getOutputStream()) {\r\n    if (obj instanceof MessageLite) {\r\n      try {\r\n        ((MessageLite) obj).writeTo(os);\r\n      } catch (IOException e) {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException(\"Google PB序列化失败，序列化对象的类型为\" + obj.getClass().getName(), e);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

All test cases pass for NacosMetadataReportTest\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-22T13:43:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T07:35:08Z","closed_at":"2020-03-06T07:35:08Z","merged_at":"2020-03-06T07:35:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"4307c2b2fab47e7bbcb78c254cfe07c921c98f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5776/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5776/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5776/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/165f06d39715108f3af55122dbea388bdbf1c329","head":{"label":"laddcn:20200221_metadata_add_test_case","ref":"20200221_metadata_add_test_case","sha":"165f06d39715108f3af55122dbea388bdbf1c329","user":{"login":"laddcn","id":53557551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTU3NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53557551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn","html_url":"https://github.com/laddcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237559425,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc1NTk0MjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"laddcn/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"laddcn","id":53557551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTU3NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53557551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","u

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nOptimize method `NetUtils#matchIpRange`\r\nI have searched in opened PR.\r\nFell free to close it if it has be included in other PRs or It is not expected to change.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Rename variable `ss` to `ignored` because it is never be used.\r\n2. Simplified `condition?:true:false` -> `condition`\r\n3. Use `StringUtils#split(String,char)` instead of `String#split(regex)`\r\n4. Calculate `ipAddress` when it will be used immediately\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe current test case 'NetUtilsTest' is enough.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix a potential NPE in CallbackServiceCodec.java\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd a null check for url and parameters.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-20T15:50:08Z","updated_at":"2020-03-13T06:20:50Z","closed_at":"2020-03-13T06:20:50Z","merged_at":"2020-03-13T06:20:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8b8b3d2ee6d97f9771411a0fdab3f5701c1fc32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64376f059e5e537fd3f623a7f4fe5e765c54e995","head":{"label":"seedeed:master","ref":"master","sha":"64376f059e5e537fd3f623a7f4fe5e765c54e995","user":{"login":"seedeed","id":10525545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed","html_url":"https://github.com/seedeed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241329011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDEzMjkwMTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"seedeed/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seedeed","id":10525545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed","html_url":"https://github.com/seedeed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seedeed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seedeed/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nto make sure stated url on provider model always correct.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nregister stated url to provider model, no matter the provider is configured to delay-published or not.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-18T10:18:00Z","updated_at":"2020-04-03T07:29:26Z","closed_at":"2020-04-03T07:29:26Z","merged_at":"2020-04-03T07:29:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d6ca6234f64a670fed2f3c5fdc1d0dba74a9c88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"qinliujie","id":8599441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1OTk0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8599441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie","html_url":"https://github.com/qinliujie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qinliujie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/de64f79001faf781d528f8f181ce49a52723299e","head":{"label":"beiwei30:stated-url","ref":"stated-url","sha":"de64f79001faf781d528f8f181ce49a52723299e","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-16T16:38:48Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T07:23:08Z","closed_at":"2020-02-26T05:54:54Z","merged_at":"2020-02-26T05:54:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d329736f9db20cdc17fe8d7a214a4a26281acb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/faca92fda73c409f4bff1538e44c2da91e294ae2","head":{"label":"LiosWong:spelling_incorrect","ref":"spelling_incorrect","sha":"faca92fda73c409f4bff1538e44c2da91e294ae2","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d30ca86395c40f366ba5e4367be6963da60d5ac3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-16T02:49:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T03:08:49Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T03:08:40Z","merged_at":"2020-03-26T03:08:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"7dbe632025ef4c991a635314fbb2bc6e344a3574","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b110fa4cb49c06ed73162c3a3644bc7b9fbeba60","head":{"label":"ZZMarquis:master","ref":"master","sha":"b110fa4cb49c06ed73162c3a3644bc7b9fbeba60","user":{"login":"ZZMarquis","id":7624583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7624583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis","html_url":"https://github.com/ZZMarquis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZZMarquis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d30ca86395c40f366ba5e4367be6963da60d5ac3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-13T02:30:28Z","updated_at":"2020-02-15T08:53:55Z","closed_at":"2020-02-15T08:53:55Z","merged_at":"2020-02-15T08:53:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"c39faaad3913560a8c83a7acc2258bd31f8cd5dd","assignee":{"login":"CodingSinger","id":18573670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTczNjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18573670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingSinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"CodingSinger","id":18573670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTczNjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18573670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingSinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingSinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5741/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5741/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5741/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/83b7c149edbfef27f34daa382e89d4fde0b39d2d","head":{"label":"HzjNeverStop:feature/pilot-registry","ref":"feature/pilot-registry","sha":"83b7c149edbfef27f34daa382e89d4fde0b39d2d","user":{"login":"HzjNeverStop","id":19757574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU3NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19757574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop","html_url":"https://github.com/HzjNeverStop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HzjNeverStop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:xds","ref":"xds","sha":"60e72bf5c91657dfae8106979cd00106e4764bab","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvc

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-11T12:38:14Z","updated_at":"2020-12-04T03:38:34Z","closed_at":"2020-04-03T02:30:01Z","merged_at":"2020-04-03T02:30:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"4dd5a0db57dec56716a7da146661866be5d05f77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/31/labels","id":5009512,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTAwOTUxMg==","number":31,"title":"2.7.7","description":"","creator":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":67,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T07:22:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:02:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5734/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5734/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5734/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e8d07c6ac3e48bd656e212f28a18d4e66463baba","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/lfu-cache","ref":"feature/lfu-cache","sha":"e8d07c6ac3e48bd656e212f28a18d4e66463baba","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-30T17:35:53Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T05:04:35Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T04:40:44Z","merged_at":"2020-01-31T04:40:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7cb918ab021a0b7efc27f9e89458e914e9c3584","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0d7cb18517eae56eeb1e310fbd623554e92117c6","head":{"label":"Moriadry-zz:feature/use-g1","ref":"feature/use-g1","sha":"0d7cb18517eae56eeb1e310fbd623554e92117c6","user":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":181289431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODEyODk0MzE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Moriadry-zz","id":6925549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjU1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6925549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moriadry-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Moriadry-zz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.
