Since then, we have fixed the hudi-presto-bundle in version 0.10.1. Now, we need to upgrade Hudi in Presto again. This is being tracked by HUDI-3010. This PR adds a note to either avoid upgrade or workaround it by manually placing the hudi-presto-bundle jar.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation

pretty heavy action especially in scenarios where S3 is used as storage.\r\nWe sometimes can see 20+ seconds for a single list action causing streaming job delay.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nJust

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nExisting `SparkHoodieTableFileIndex` requires checking against the key generator class name to generate the partition schema.  This logic introduces NPE when the key generator class name is not present in `hoodie.properties`.  This PR fixes the issue so that if the key generator class name is not present, default logic is used.\r\n\r\nStacktrace:\r\n```\r\nscala> val basePath = \"/tmp/hoodie/hudi-test-topic\"\r\nbasePath:

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIntroducing restore.requested instant for restore action. \r\n- Restore is split into restore plan and restore execution phase. \r\n- A restore Plan is added which gets serialized into restore.requested instant during planning phase. This contains the list of instants to rollback. \r\n- During execution phase, restore plan is read from the requested instant and individual rollbacks are executed. \r\n- Once completed, timeline will contain 3 meta files for restore (requested, inflight and complete) and no meta files for rollbacks will be present in timeline. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn a recent OSS [change](https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/ce7d2333078e4e1f16de1bce6d448c5eef1e4111), hoodie.rollback.using.markers is enabled by default. However, if you are trying rolling back a completed instance, Hudi would throw this exception:\r\n\r\n \r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot use marker based rollback strategy on completed instant:[20211228041514616__commit__COMPLETED]\r\nat org.apache.hudi.common.util.ValidationUtils.checkArgument(ValidationUtils.java:40)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem in our integration test testHudiCliRollback, it tries rolling back a complete instance. But right now, through Hudi CLI, the commit rollback command does not provide customers anyway to disable hoodie.rollback.using.markers which means customers can never use commit rollback command to rollback a completed commit.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added a parameter called usingMarkers so that customers can disable this feature\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added a test case to cover this change.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWe introduced hudi-presto-bundle in the presto-hive module which caused some build issue in presto installation. See https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/17164 for more details. This PR fixes the hudi-presto-bundle to solve that issue. Specifically:\r\n\r\n- Removes parquet-avro and avro from hudi-presto-bundle. Presto has a higher version of both, and I checked for the APIs that we use, which have not changed in the presto version of parquet or avro.\r\n- Removes hbase-shaded-server and shade the hbase-server which is included as part of hudi-common. This will ensure that the only namespace that is there in jar are hudi-related i.e. com/uber/hoodie/hadoop/* and org/apache/hudi/*\r\n- Total size of bundle: 16 MB.\r\n\r\n## Brief change

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR makes Kafka Connect Sink for Hudi to write empty commits when there are no new messages from the Kafka topic.  This avoids constant rollbacks if the Kafka topic has no new message.  Regardless of whether there are new messages or not, the write commit logic, including archival, is always executed, resolving the problem of no archival of rollbacks when there is no new message as well.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Removes the check of the size of write status list from all participants in `ConnectTransactionCoordinator`.\r\n  - Adds a new test for empty status list.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Run Kafka Connect Sink for Hudi using Quick Start Guide\r\n- Publish some messages to the Kafka topic: `bash setupKafka.sh -n 100 -b 6`\r\n- Wait for some time so the Sink ingests all messages and writes empty commits\r\n- Publish more messages to the topic: `bash setupKafka.sh -n 100 -b 6 -o 600 -t`\r\n- Verify the table timeline using hudi-cli:\r\n```\r\nhudi:hudi-test-topic->commits

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix MOR snapshot query path during compaction for HIVE read. \r\n\r\nIn current implementation, if a write comes in and complete during compaction, it will not be visible to snapshot query until the compaction completes. This is caused by filter logic of getting file group's log files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Include pending compactions in the timeline for the file group retrieval logic.\r\n\r\n##

set\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf user has not set a config and `setDefaults()` is not called before checking the config, then `getBoolean` (or getString, getInt) returns null which can cause NPE. At least, for boolean configs we should return default value if it is provided in config declaration. This does not change the behavior. For string or int configs, we should let it return null because there can be checks in the code based on null or empty. In that case we don't want to set some value.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- We commit to metadata table followed by data table while committing any writes. At the end of metadata table commit, we also trigger compaction if conditions are met. There is a chance that the actual write eventually failed in data table on which case, compaction could have included the uncommitted data. But once compacted, it may never be ignored while reading from metadata table. So, this patch fixes the bug. Metadata table compaction is triggered before applying the commit to metadata table to circumvent this issue. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nExtracted common Hudi table's file-index `AbstractHoodieTableFileIndex` to be shared across engines (Spark, Hive for now)\r\n\r\n`AbstractHoodieTableFileIndex` is defined as engine agnostic table's file-index aspect of the current `HoodieFileIndex` implementation.\r\n\r\nAs such following split is established in this PR: \r\n\r\n- `AbstractHoodieTableFileIndex`: generic file-index component responsible for providing accurate file listings based on the timeline, and instant(s) of interest.\r\n- `SparkHoodieTableFileIndex`: Spark-specific implementation of the `AbstractHoodieTableFileIndex`\r\n- `HoodieFileIndex`: Spark SQL's `FileIndex` implementation for Hudi Tables based on `SparkHoodieTableFileIndex`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nPlease see above\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nDuring metadata table bootstrap, we should include files only from completed commits and not all files after listing files using fs. This patch fixes the same to consider files only from completed commits. \r\n\r\nIf not for the fix, potential issue:\r\nSame files will be added twice to metadata table. once with bootstrap commit and once by the inflight commit when applied to metadata table. Our combine logic will sum up the file size and will show as 2x. And so queries might end up with EOF exception while trying to read 2x size.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nTestHoodieMetadataBootstrap.testMetadataBootstrapWithExtraFiles\r\n\r\n##
