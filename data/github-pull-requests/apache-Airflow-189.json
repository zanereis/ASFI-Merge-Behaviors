prepare_usage command was being called and setting variables to produce the full usage text for all commands at start up -- and while this isn't a problem for speed, it makes the output when running with `bash -x`/`VERBOSE_COMMANDS` a **lot** longer.\n\nThis change delays creating the usage variables and formatted versions until they are needed.\n\nNet result when running this command:\n\n```sh\nbash -c 'exec 5>breeze-trace.log; export BASH_XTRACEFD=5; VERBOSE_COMMANDS=true VERBOSE=true ./breeze -n shell -- -c \"true\"'\n```\n\nBefore 4500 lines, 204K of \"trace\" logs\n\n```\n❯ wc -lc breeze-trace.log\n  4528 204088 breeze-trace.log\n```\n\nAfter is 1/4 as much output:\n\n```\n❯ wc -lc breeze-trace-with-change.log\n  1402  68167 breeze-trace-with-change.log\n```\n\nThis PR has no functional impact on the breeze script (I tested `flags`, `help`, `help-all` and `--help` on subcommands, all produce the same output) but makes it easier to debug breeze commands.","created_at":"2021-05-20T13:36:10Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T13:57:39Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T13:41:12Z","merged_at":"2021-05-20T13:41:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a51a1001cb3b07dad81a7d794eee3b4d16a5120f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/15970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/15970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/15970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3c17a06647bc43c358c33ae14b31c382c46e9562","head":{"label":"astronomer:less-verbose-breeze-when-debugging","ref":"less-verbose-breeze-when-debugging","sha":"3c17a06647bc43c358c33ae14b31c382c46e9562","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

PR closes #15948 by adding support for `snowflake` connection types to the list in `get_hook` in the Connection class.\r\n\r\nTwo comments for reviewers:\r\n\r\n1. I wasn't sure if it was appropriate to add tests for this somewhere. It seems that either in `test_core.py` or `test_sql_sensor.py` would be appropriate, but none of the existing tests in either of those files seemed relevant to this sort of change (they don't exhaustively test the different hook types). Happy to add something if pointed in the right direction, though. As noted in the Issue, I have tested and implemented this change already in my company's internal environment.\r\n2. I wasn't exactly sure what the right base branch was for a change that only seems to affect 1.10.x branches. I haven't used or looked at Airflow 2.x code in detail to know if the same issue exists there, but the code does seem refactored to remove this big if-else block in the master branch. Please let me know if this should have a different base branch.\r\n\r\nThanks for your review!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

explained at the issue [#15946](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/15946) the Web UI does not show the log for tasks that failed when the owner of the DAG is not airflow or the DAG is being executed by another user (run_as_user parameter). When airflow is dumping the error to the temporary file, it opens the file for writing and raises a Permission Denied error, since it's created with restricted permissions. Any default user cannot write into the file, only read.\r\n\r\nThe NamedTemporaryFile created at the base_task_runner creates the file with the umask 600 and that module does not allow to pass custom permissions when creating the object. \r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, i've added a os.chmod after creating the NamedTemporaryFile at the base_task_runner module. After that, no Permission Denied is thrown when a task fails and the log is accessible through the Web UI.\r\n\r\nNo major changes were made, only the chmod being applied solved the problem.\r\n\r\nCloses

![2021-05-19_15-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/118834038-d7910c80-b8b9-11eb-927c-bb61bfa937ff.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n  And then the old job shows this as the reason\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/118834270-00190680-b8ba-11eb-8fd0-694f9ebcad5e.png)\r\n\r\n- GitHub displays these checks directly on the PR, but it is still run\r\n  in the context of our repo, meaning it has access write to our\r\n  repo/access to secrets etc.\r\n\r\n  ![2021-05-19_15-45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34150/118834327-0ad39b80-b8ba-11eb-8830-0cf6c23f89e0.png)\r\n\r\n- Since it shows up directly on the PR checks, we don't need to create the\r\n  check in the \"CI\" workflow to show the status of the Image Build.\r\n\r\n- We also don't need to post the comment saying _why_ it failed, as the\r\n  Build Image status will show up directly there\r\n\r\n- Since `pull_request_target` has information about the PR in the\r\n  `github.event` context, we don't need the complex mechanism to find\r\n  the \"other\" PR, we can do a fairly simple API request and filter by\r\n  the commit SHA to find and cancel to CI workflow job. (This removes\r\n  the final use of the cancel-workflow-action)\r\n\r\nOne change I had to make here what tag we use for Docker images we build\r\nand push up. Previously we used the \"source run ID\" (i.e. the id of the\r\nCI run) but with pull_request_target we don't have that anymore. We\r\ncould use the same API mechanism we do to cancel to find the target job,\r\nbut the only requirement here is for an ID that both jobs know -- the\r\nSHA of the PR branch fills that need\r\n\r\nExtra side benefits of this:\r\n\r\n- The sidebar of commits in main branch aren't \"polluted\" with Build\r\n  Images for PRs like they were previously.\r\n\r\nStill do do:\r\n\r\n- [x] ~Update breeze to pull the new image tag format when given a numeric id (use API to look up sha that a build is for)~ Update docs to remove references to RUN_ID\r\n- [x] Delete old build-image-workflow-run workflow

a task fails in executor while still queued in scheduler, the executor reports\r\nthis failure but scheduler doesn't change the task state resulting in the task\r\nbeing queued until the scheduler is restarted. This commit fixes it by ensuring\r\nthat when a task is reported to have failed in the executor, the task is failed\r\nin scheduler\r\n\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced with CeleryExecutor in breeze\r\n1. Start breeze without redis integration\r\n2. start the webserver and scheduler\r\n3. Run a dag e.g example_bash_operator.py\r\n4. The CeleryExecutor will raise exceptions and fails the task\r\n4.

safety measure just in case someone does something \"clever\".\r\n\r\n~This change does mean that templates can no longer access any attributes that start with a `_`, i.e. `{{ obj._foo }}` would now fail~\r\n\r\nThe second commit in this PR changes it so that `obj._foo` continues to work, to reduce chance of breaking existing

all: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/spark/v2.4.8-rc3-bin/ so it is easy to\r\n\"just move\" from \"dev\" to \"release\" without changing anything.\r\n\r\nFor Airflow releases since we already do it in a directory that is named \"VERSION-rcX\" (example: `2.1.0rc1` in https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/2.1.0rc1/)\r\nwe don't need to add rcX in the filename of the artifact.\r\n\r\nThis helps us just moving files without renaming and changing filenames in SHA512 and is released exactly with what was voted on.\r\n\r\nFor Providers, looks like we were never adding suffix anyway:  example: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/providers/\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds support of support of capacity provider strategy for ECSOperator. The logic is based on [ECS.Client.run_task documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/ecs.html#ECS.Client.run_task). \r\n\r\nCloses #8381 \r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThere is a logic related to the `platform_version`  that I find tricky:\r\n```\r\n            if self.launch_type == 'FARGATE':\r\n                run_opts['platformVersion'] = self.platform_version\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for me, the operator should pass to the `run_task` every parameter that user provided. And that should be responsibility of the user to think about which parameters and under which conditions are needed. But to be consistent with the logic, I also provide `platform_version` if `capacity_provider_strategy` is specified. `capacity_provider_strategy` can be used only with Fargate, so the platform version should be passed as well. But as we can see, picking the parameters introduces an unnecessary  complexity.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-14T11:03:44Z","updated_at":"2021-06-12T23:54:59Z","closed_at":"2021-06-12T23:54:56Z","merged_at":"2021-06-12T23:54:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"30708b5b254960395d8061e8c403294b93900c4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"feluelle","id":23282078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjgyMDc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23282078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle","html_url":"https://github.com/feluelle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feluelle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon
