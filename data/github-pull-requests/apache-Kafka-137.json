Removed Scala consumers (`SimpleConsumer` and `ZooKeeperConsumerConnector`)\r\nand their tests.\r\n- Removed Scala request/response/message classes.\r\n- Removed any mention of new consumer or new producer in the code\r\nwith the exception of MirrorMaker where the new.consumer option was\r\nnever deprecated so we have to keep it for now. The non-code\r\ndocumentation has not been updated either, that will be done\r\nseparately.\r\n- Removed a number of tools that only made sense in the context\r\nof the Scala consumers (see upgrade notes).\r\n- Updated some tools that worked with both Scala and Java consumers\r\nso that they only support the latter (see upgrade notes).\r\n- Removed `BaseConsumer` and related classes apart from `BaseRecord`\r\nwhich is used in `MirrorMakerMessageHandler`. The latter is a pluggable\r\ninterface so effectively public API.\r\n- Removed `ZkUtils` methods that were only used by the old consumers.\r\n- Removed `ZkUtils.registerBroker` and `ZKCheckedEphemeral` since\r\nthe broker now uses the methods in `KafkaZkClient` and no-one else\r\nshould be using that method.\r\n- Updated system tests so that they don't use the Scala consumers except\r\nfor multi-version tests.\r\n- Updated LogDirFailureTest so that the consumer offsets topic would\r\ncontinue to be available after all the failures. This was necessary for it\r\nto work with the Java consumer.\r\n- Some multi-version system tests had not been updated to include\r\nrecently released Kafka versions, fixed it.\r\n- Updated findBugs and checkstyle configs not to refer to deleted\r\nclasses and packages.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-14T18:42:09Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T14:33:02Z","closed_at":"2018-06-19T14:32:55Z","merged_at":"2018-06-19T14:32:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc4dce94af8b19a796eeb7a9be78640739cb1a48","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2e94ea168d55ec89a456ca12ccf51c2330133ca8","head":{"label":"ijuma:kafka-2983-remove-scala-consumers","ref":"kafka-2983-remove-scala-consumers","sha":"2e94ea168d55ec89a456ca12ccf51c2330133ca8","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

added numeric converters to Connect, but these were added in Connect’s API module in the same package as the `StringConverter`. This commit moves them into the Runtime module and into the `converters` package where the `ByteArrayConverter` already lives. These numeric converters have not yet been included in a release, and so they can be moved without concern.\r\n\r\nAll of Connect’s converters must be referenced in worker / connector configurations and are therefore part of the API, but otherwise do not need to be in the “api” module as they do not need to be instantiated or directly used by extensions. This change makes them more similar to and aligned with the `ByteArrayConverter`.\r\n\r\nIt also gives us the opportunity to move them into the “api” module in the future (keeping the same package name), should we ever want or need to do so. However, if we were to start out with them in the “api” module, we would never be able to move them out into the “runtime” module, even if we kept the same package name. Therefore, moving them to “runtime” now gives us a bit more flexibility.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the unit tests for the numeric converters accordingly, and updates the `PluginsUtil` and `PluginUtilsTest` as well.","created_at":"2018-06-14T03:37:20Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T06:03:00Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T21:54:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"615f2becfd46de39279c1c9c9d808813a5bfd5ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ff0c929bec323c8daf55c5a57f6e82b0ac61e823","head":{"label":"rhauch:kafka-7056","ref":"kafka-7056","sha":"ff0c929bec323c8daf55c5a57f6e82b0ac61e823","user":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40898643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDg5ODY0Mw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"rhauch/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rhauch","id":84732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhauch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rhauch/kafka","description":"Mirror

seen cases where under a constant metadata update load (automated partition rebalance) request handling threads can block for a significant amount of time on the metadata lock.\r\n\r\nthe reason is that for large enough clusters (~200,000 topic partitions) a read operation can actually take a long while to compose a response. under a constant stream of reads + writes we see situations where a reader is currently in, a writer is pending (blocked) and then a big pile-up of more readers that are blocked behind the pending writer.\r\n\r\nthis patch makes the read path lock-free. the metadata is now stored in a logically-immutable snapshot. all read operations grab a snapshot and serve data out of it. write paths create an entirely new snapshot and atomically assign it. writers are still under a lock, for mutual exclusion.\r\n\r\nhere's the benchmark code i used to measure the effects of this patch:\r\n```java\r\npublic class MetadataCacheBenchmark {\r\n    private volatile boolean

throws an exception if a sink or a processor is added without at least one upstream node, as records cannot be forwarded downstream to an unconnected node. This does not prevent users from attempting to forward to unconnected nodes, but it does prevent them from attaching effectively useless downstream nodes, and the error message for forwarding to an unconnected node has been updated to be slightly more specific.\r\n\r\n`connectProcessors` has also been removed from `InternalTopologyBuilder`, as it is only used in `KStreamImpl` for a stream-table join and in fact connecting the stream source/processor to the join processor with appropriate `valueGetter` (to retrieve values from the KTable) is sufficient to obtain values for both sides.","created_at":"2018-06-13T19:48:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-04T03:05:24Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T03:26:02Z","merged_at":"2018-06-15T03:26:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"339fc2379dd0d01bc039518f70b017b7520dcc9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4abf281416c70eab6c5cff4db767a8cc7e564f27","head":{"label":"nixsticks:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"4abf281416c70eab6c5cff4db767a8cc7e564f27","user":{"login":"nixsticks","id":5731408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzE0MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5731408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks","html_url":"https://github.com/nixsticks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78236843,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODIzNjg0Mw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"nixsticks/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nixsticks","id":5731408,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzE0MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5731408?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks","html_url":"https://github.com/nixsticks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixsticks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nixsticks/kafka","description":"Mirror

for [KAFKA-7010](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7010).\r\n\r\nThe initial PR for KIP-290 #5117 added a new `ResourceNameType`, which was initially a field on `Resource` and `ResourceFilter`. However, follow on PRs have now moved the name type fields to new `ResourcePattern` and `ResourcePatternFilter` classes. This means the old name is no longer valid and may be confusing. The PR looks to rename the class to a more intuitive `resource.PatternType`.\r\n\r\n@cmccabe also requested that the current `ANY` value for this class be renamed to avoid confusion. `PatternType.ANY` currently causes `ResourcePatternFilter` to bring back all ACLs that would affect the supplied resource, i.e. it brings back literal, wildcard ACLs, and also does pattern matching to work out which prefix acls would affect the resource.  This is very different from the behaviour of `ResourceType.ANY`, which just means the filter ignores the type of resources. \r\n\r\n `ANY` is to be renamed to `MATCH` to disambiguate it from other `ANY` filter types. A new `ANY` will be added that works in the same way as others, i.e. it will cause the filter to ignore the pattern type, (but won't do any pattern matching).\r\n\r\ncc @junrao \r\n\r\n### Committer

for the massive PR, but at this point, it's very difficult to break up into smaller parts now that we are building the logical and physical plan.\r\nIt's worth noting at the moment this PR does not include optimizations to help with the review burden, the 4th PR will include an optimization for repartition topics and re-using source topics as changelogs for KTables\r\n \r\n\r\nThe specific changes in this PR from the second PR include\r\n2. Changed the types of graph nodes to names conveying more context\r\n2. Build the entire physical plan from the graph, after `StreamsBuilder.build()` is called.\r\n\r\nOther changes are addressed directly as review comments on the PR.\r\n\r\nTesting consists of using all existing streams tests to validate building the physical plan with graph\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

there,\r\nI have come up with an implementation for the consumer generation materialization. Jira here:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7018\r\n\r\nThe background is that to reduce number of rebalance during consumer restart and blocking rebalance based on session timeout (especially for stream applications), we are proposing to remember the consumer client-id to generation mapping, so that on the broker side when the same instance connects with existing generation data, it would be treated as an existing member so that no rebalance will be triggered.\r\n\r\nThis implementation doesn't have unit test yet.

patch fixes the following issues in the log splitting logic added to address KAFKA-6264:\r\n\r\n1. We were not handling the case when all messages in the segment overflowed the index. In this case, there is only one resulting segment following the split.\r\n2. There was an off-by-one error in the recovery logic when completing a swap operation which caused an unintended segment deletion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patch factors out of `splitOverflowedSegment` a method to write to a segment using from with an instance of `FileRecords`. This allows for future reuse and isolated testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

PR actually contains two changes:\r\n\r\n1) leverage on the TOPOLOGY_OPTIMIZATION config to \"adjust\" the topology internally to reuse the source topic.\r\n\r\n2) fixed a long dangling bug that whenever source topic is reused as changelog topic, write the checkpoint file for the consumed offset, this is done by union the `ackedOffset` from the producer, plus the `consumed` offset from the consumer, note we will priori ackedOffset since the same topic may show up in both (think about repartition topic), by doing this the consumed offset from source topics can be treated as checkpointed offset when reuse happens.\r\n\r\n3) added a few unit and integration tests with / wo  the reusing, and make sure the restoration, standby task, and internal topic creation behaviors are all

for [KAFKA-7007](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7007).\r\n\r\nThe initial PR for KIP-290 #5117 added a new path in ZK for ACL change events to come through for the new Prefixed resource pattern.  @Jun requested that this be reverted, and in its place we should use JSON values for the change events.\r\n\r\nThis PR looks to make these changes. Where possible, I've put code back to being the same as pre PR 5117.\r\n\r\ncc @cmccabe, @junrao \r\n\r\n*UPDATE*: After implementing the switch to JSON it was decided that this causes too many potential problems. Instead, the code now looks to encode a 3 part ACL change event, (`<resource-type>:<name-type>:<name>`), where the old brokers used a 2 part event, (`<resource-type>:<name>`).  Older brokers will effectively ignore the new style events, without any errors or warnings.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*: After more discussions a new hybrid approach is being adopted. The PR _now_ looks to:\r\n - Keep Literal ACLs on the old paths, using the old formats, to maintain backwards compatibility.\r\n - Have Prefixed, and any latter types, go on new paths, using JSON, (old brokers are not aware of them)\r\n - Add checks to reject any adminClient requests to add prefixed acls before the cluster is fully upgraded.\r\nNote:\r\n - Using new AckCommands / kafka-acls during upgrade for literal resource patterns will work\r\n - Using new AckCommands / kafka-acls during upgrade for prefixed resource patterns will lead to indeterminate behaviour, (which is highlighted in upgrades.html)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

for [KAFKA-7011](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7011).\r\n\r\nThe initial PR for KIP-290 #5117 added a `ResourceNameType` field to the Java and Scala `Resource` classes to introduce the concept of Prefixed ACLS.  This does not make a lot of sense as these classes are meant to represent cluster resources, which would not have a concept of 'name type'. This work has not been released yet, so we have time to change it.\r\n\r\nThis PR looks to refactor the code to remove the name type field from the Java `Resource` class. (The Scala one will age out once KIP-290 is done, and removing it would involve changes to the `Authorizer` interface, so this class was not touched).\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by replacing the use of `Resource` with `ResourcePattern` and `ResourceFilter` with `ResourceFilterPattern`.  A `ResourcePattern` is a combination of resource type, name and name type, where each field needs to be defined. A `ResourcePatternFilter` is used to select patterns during describe and delete operations.\r\n\r\nThe adminClient uses `AclBinding` and `AclBindingFilter`. These types have been switched over to use the new pattern types.\r\n\r\nThe AclCommands class, used by Kafka-acls.sh, has been converted to use the new pattern types.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the original `Resource` and `ResourceFilter` classes are not really used anywhere, except deprecated methods. However, the `Resource` class will be used if/when KIP-50 is done.\r\n\r\ncc @cmccabe, @junrao \r\n\r\nThis PR will need cherry picking onto the 2.0 branch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

tried multiple ways to add a upgrade path patch for users from StreamsBuilder users in 1.0 / 1.1 to 2.0 with source KTable topics reusing. The following approach has the smallest changes on code and hopefully have the least changes.\r\n\r\nNote that I do not intentionally write a checkpoint file after the restoration is done, since it will cause the logic to become too complex with / without EOS. If we do not have this checkpoint file containing the offset of the source topic, then if there is a crash between starting the restoration and writing the first checkpoint file in task.commit during normal processing, upon resuming we will restore from the old changelog again and may have duplicates if EOS is not turned on. But both are existed today so we are not introducing any regressions.\r\n\r\nAnother note is that the changelog topic map now have three different code paths (it is not introduced by this PR, but just want to bring this up to attention):\r\n\r\n1. From `InternalTopologyBuilder.topicGroups`, used by the partition assignor to create those changelog topics; for this case if a state store is not logging enabled it should not be in this map.\r\n\r\n2. From `InternalTopologBuilder.build` that generates the `ProcessorTopology` and then later used in `ProcessorStateManager`. Here even if a store is not logging enabled, if it still need to be restored either in a standby task or as part of the restoration of an active task, it should still be in the storesToChangelogs map, but note that the changelog topic names may not always be `stateStore-changelog`.\r\n\r\n3. In `StoreBuilder`, decide whether we should really wrap it with the logging layer, and if yes, which topic to write to. Here if logging is disabled we should never wrap the logging layer, otherwise we wrap logging with the normal `stateStore-changelog` topic name.\r\n\r\nRight now these logic modules are handled by completely different code paths; it is a bit complex for future optimizations on the topology.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
