PR introduces shard aware aggregation to achieve better aggregation results (to better max out Kinesis API limits).\r\n\r\nIf **random** partitioning is sufficient, this can already be achieved using the explicit random partitioner. The benefit of this approach is that it doesn't require pulling shard details through the API.\r\nHowever, the random partitioner uses a static configuration that doesn't handle any resharding, that may occur.\r\n\r\n**Shard aware aggregation** is implemented as follows:\r\n\r\n- Periodically the writer pulls hash key ranges assigned to shards. These are statically shared using an ObjectPool to minimize the necessary API calls.\r\n\r\n- The configured partitioner is used to generate the `partitionKey` and the optional `explicitHashKey` for each record. If `explicitHashKey` is set, it is used as is with no change in behavior. Otherwise, however, the lower bound of the hash key range of the target shard (based on the hashed `partitionKey`) is chosen for aggregation and set as `explicitHashKey`.\r\n\r\nThis makes sure aggregated records always contain only records that match the shard they are routed to even if the stream is in the process of resharding.\r\n\r\nTo simplify statically sharing the shard state, `ClientPool` was generalized to `ObjectPool`. This should be fine as the code wasn't released yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

currently relies on roundtrip tests to verify we can convert types to proto and vice versa, but in some cases these tests are trivially correct due to the result being cached in the global `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`. This change makes it possible to override the global schema registry for use in tests.\r\n\r\nIt also consolidates uuid generation in a `generate_new_id` function which checks for collisions. Note collisions are exceedingly rare, per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Collisions) we'd need to have 2.71e18 schemas to have a 50% probability of collisions. But the consequences of a collision could be serious, so it makes sense to guarantee schema uuids are unique and fail at construction time in the exceedingly rare event that we can't guarantee it.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[![Build python source distribution and

bundle-based batching for ElasticsearchIO\r\n------------------------\r\nRather than support both bundle- and state-based batching, this PR removes bundle-based batching in favour of solely supporting state-based batching (via GroupIntoBatches).  This will ensure that batching has a centralized transform for re-use, and most importantly will ensure that windows stay intact throughout ElasticsearchIO#write.\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

has two KafkaIO source implementations now:\r\n * a modern one implemented as a Splittable DoFn (SDF), and\r\n * a (deprecated) legacy one implemented as an SDF wrapper over an UnboundedSource and KafkaUnboundedReader classes.\r\n\r\nO found that the legacy KafkaIO source can not provide good throughput when the latency of calls to Kafka [Consumer.poll|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaUnboundedReader.java#L523] becomes high. The degradation is very sharp: a pipeline that drops elements immediately after reading them from source was only able to read about 100-1000 qps per Kafka partition. The Kafka cluster was overprovisioned but was in a remote network and had poll latency about 30ms.\r\n\r\nThe cause of throughput degradation is poor choice of the [RECORDS_DEQUEUE_POLL_TIMEOUTT|https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/KafkaUnboundedReader.java#L334-L335] set too low, it should be longer than any reasonable expected Kafka poll latency. This is what's happening otherwise:\r\n\r\n* consumerPollLoop fetches data bundle from Kafka via poll() and offers it to the avaliableRecordsQueue\r\n* message processing loop fetches bundle from avaliableRecordsQueue and unblocks the consumerPollLoop\r\n* consumerPollLoop calls poll() again\r\n* message processing loop completes processing the bundle BEFORE the poll() call above completes, and tries to fetch next bundle from avaliableRecordsQueue.\r\n* fetch from avaliableRecordsQueue has a very short timeout (10ms) and if it expires before the pending poll() in the consumerPollLoop completes the message processing loop will believe there's no fresh data in Kafka and exit. All the time until the message processing loop is rescheduled is wasted.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n - [x] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

reached feature parity and is finally recommended over the earlier `amazon-web-services` and `kinesis` modules (Java). These will be deprecated in one of the next releases ([BEAM-13174](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13174)).\r\n  * Long outstanding write support for `Kinesis` was added ([BEAM-13175](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13175)).\r\n  * Configuration was simplified and made consistent across all IOs, including the usage of `AwsOptions` ([BEAM-13563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13563), [BEAM-13663](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13663), [BEAM-13587](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13587)).\r\n  * Additionally, there's a long list of recent improvements and fixes to  \r\n    `S3` Filesystem ([BEAM-13245](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13245), [BEAM-13246](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13246), [BEAM-13441](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13441), [BEAM-13445](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13445), [BEAM-14011](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14011)), \r\n    `DynamoDB` IO ([BEAM-13209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13009), [BEAM-13209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13209)),\r\n    `SQS` IO ([BEAM-13631](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13631), [BEAM-13510](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13510)) and others.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Bug: the show and collect commands under Interactive Beam would eventually call a PipelineFragment to execute the InteractiveRunner corresponding to the given PCollection. The PipelineFragment by default does not wait for pipeline to finish execution, and when a pipeline runs the FlinkRunner remotely, the Interactive Environment is not updated with the results of the pipeline run. Subsequent calls to ib.show/ib.collect would rerun the pipeline instead of directly retrieving the results from the Interactive Environment.\r\n- Setting the blocking to be True when using the FlinkRunner inside the RecordingManager.record() method when calling the .run() method of the PipelineFragment properly saves completed pipeline results in the Interactive Environment and prevents a need to rerun the pipelines again on subsequent calls to ib.show/ib.collect.\r\n- ASF Jira thread: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14091\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, multiple go integration tests are excluded on Flink because they run into the following Flink error:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.io.IOException: Insufficient number of network buffers: required 17, but only 14 available. The total number of network buffers is currently set to 2048 of 32768 bytes each. You can increase this number by setting the configuration keys 'taskmanager.memory.network.fraction', 'taskmanager.memory.network.min', and 'taskmanager.memory.network.max'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n(the number of available/required network buffers is variable from run to run).\r\n\r\nThe underlying cause of this error is that we allow a greater parallelism than we have network memory to support for these tests (specifically, parallelism = # available cores[1]), and we run into issues when performing shuffle operations. This is expected to happen sometimes[1] depending on the workload, with the expectation that users will do the appropriate tuning. This PR fixes this problem by doubling the fraction of flink memory to be used as network memory from 10% to 20% and upping the max network memory for task executors from 1 gb to 2 gb (see more on these config options here - https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/deployment/config/#taskmanager-memory-network-fraction). This will help us avoid this issue while still staying within the bounds of a reasonable flink config.\r\n\r\n[1] https://lists.apache.org/thread/p04qpcxxfvpqzowgy7lpos1gzdns4cnm\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Context\r\n\r\nRight now, commenting and saving state when handling the `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment` events fails when the pull author is not a committer. This happens because GitHub doesn't allow their issued token to have any write permissions on forks from non-committers and there is no way to override that (even #17031 gets overridden on forks apparently 😢 ). While we're able to get around this for most pull_request events by using `pull_request_target`, no analogous event exists for `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment`.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we don't _need_ to do anything from these events. Right now, on `pull_request_review` we assign a committer if the review is an approval from a reviewer. That information can be discovered by looking at all reviews for a pr during our scheduled run. This is less responsive, but still allows us to get a committer assigned in <30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere's not as good of a workaround for `pull_request_review_comment`, but we can simply restrict command parsing to the main thread without a significant impact to user experience.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all processing of the `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment` events. It doesn't replace the functionality of `pull_request_review_comment` events, but it does move the logic from `pull_request_review` events into our scheduled action execution. This was tested against my test repo and worked. There shouldn't be auth issues since we're already successfully commenting and updating state from this action.\r\n\r\nThe biggest diffs in this PR are just moving code from processPrUpdates to processNewPrs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

package contains an io-connector for [CDAP](https://cdap.atlassian.net/wiki/home) sources and sinks.\r\n`CdapIO` is the primary class used in working with the connector in a pipeline. It contains static `PTransform` classes that represents reads/writes within the I/O (e.g. `Read`, `Write`).\r\n\r\n![package drawio (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/157455025-1a58eb9d-0930-4a83-aaa2-9c226fe0281d.png)\r\n\r\n`CdapIO.<~>read()` method method starts constructing a `CdapIO.Read` transform, it receives a type parameters`<~>` that specify the output type for CDAP source.\r\nThe `Read` class implements an interface similar to the builder pattern and has simple `withX()` methods for passing configuration and other settings needed before start reading from CDAP source:\r\n- `withCdapPluginClass()` - pass a source/sink plugin class marked with CDAP `@Plugin` annotation. (e.g. `ZendeskBatchSource.class`) \r\n- `withPluginConfig()`- pass a corresponding `PluginConfig` object (e.g. `ZendeskBatchSourceConfig.class`)\r\n- `withKeyClass()` - specify the key class for the output (e.g. `NullWritable.class`)\r\n- `withValueClass()`- specify the value class for the output (e.g. `StructuredRecord.class`)\r\n\r\nInside the `.withCdapPluginClass()` method, the `CdapPlugin` object is constructed. `CdapPlugin` object contains the following information about CDAP plugin:\r\n- Bounded/Unbounded\r\n- Input/Output\r\n- `BatchContextImpl` object for stubbing some CDAP-specific behavior\r\n- Format / Key / Value classes needed for filling Hadoop `Configuration` object\r\n- `T cdapPluginObj` for performing `prepareRun()` call before reading\r\n\r\nThe following steps are performed in the `Read.expand()` method:\r\n- Validating that all configs and other obligatory fields are set\r\n- Call `CdapPlugin.prepareRun()` method before reading (see javadoc)\r\n- Construct the needed `Read` transform depending on whether the `CdapPlugin` is bounded / unbounded:\r\n- - For bounded sources `HadoopFormatIO.<K, V>read()` method is called passing filled Hadoop `Configuration` object.\r\n- - For unbounded sources `SparkReceiverIO.<~>read()` method is called.\r\n\r\n![156-seq drawio(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/155947282-342fa263-66c4-45f9-9ac1-2863f563138e.png)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24961\r\n\r\nCDAP plugins use their own configuration classes (ex. `SalesforceSourceConfig`, `SalesforceStreamingSourceConfig`) to set the required parameters to prepare and run pipeline in Source or Sink classes. All these config classes are extended from the base `io.cdap.cdap.api.plugin.PluginConfig` class.\r\nAs a first step in integration of **_CDAP plugins_** and _**Apache Beam**_, there should be implemented a mechanism to create an instance of the specific `PluginConfig` implementation.\r\n\r\n![Untitled Diagram drawio(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/147752088-5ffa6117-16aa-4ddd-af83-edb2f770963b.png)\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, suggested solution provides a `ConfigWrapper<T>` class. Apache Beam user creates an instance of this class by passing the `PluginConfig` specific class as a `T` parameter. \r\n`ConfigWrapper<T>` object provides simple methods to instantiate the corresponding `T` object:\r\n1. `fromJsonFile(File file)`\r\n2. `withParams(Map<String, Object> params)`\r\n3. `setParam(String paramName, Object value)`\r\n4. `build()`\r\n\r\nApache Beam user could set required parameters for the CDAP plugin by passing the Map/JSON file or by manually setting each parameter.\r\nAfter that, when the `build()` method was called, the `ConfigWrapper<T>` uses `InstantiationUtils`, which in turn uses Reflection API. `InstantiationUtils` class provides mechanisms for:\r\n1. Creating an empty `PluginConfig` object bypassing the limitations of private constructors or the absence of no-args constructor.\r\n2. Going over all `Field`s with the `cdap.Name` annotation and setting the appropriate parameter values for them. \r\nAs a result `ConfigWrapper<T>` returns `PluginConfig` object which can be further used when integrating with the corresponding plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Untitled Diagram drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/147752102-79457cce-1b4c-4a87-8404-ca9068915d9b.png)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a continuation of the effort to add Bundle Finalization started in #16980\r\n\r\n**Summary of Overall Changes**\r\n\r\nBundle finalization enables a DoFn to perform side effects after a runner has acknowledged that it has durably persisted the output. Right now, Java and Python support bundle finalization by allowing a user to register a callback function which is invoked when the runner acknowledges that it has persisted all output, but Go does not have any such support. This is part of a larger change to add support to the Go Sdk as outlined in this [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dLylt36oFhsWfyBaqPayYXqYHCICNrSZ6jmr51eqZ4k/edit#).\r\n\r\n**Summary of Changes in this PR**\r\n\r\nI completed most of the execution changes in the last pr, leaving this PR to handle the user experience and plumbing the user's bundle finalization parameter through to the execution layer.\r\n\r\n**Additional testing done**\r\n\r\nOn top of the units added, I also was able to run an E2E example on Dataflow (FWIW, [only Dataflow currently has bundle finalization support](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/bounded-splittable-dofn-support-status/)). In that example, I hijacked the wordcount example and added a bundleFinalizer to write a file to persistent storage for each line that had at least 3 words (chosen pretty randomly to minimize the chances of collisions). I'll omit the whole sample since its long, but it produced a bunch of files like this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"259\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/156254068-adab3a92-7978-4284-9963-8b80c8ecbf59.png\">\r\n\r\nThis indeed ran after the other data was persisted.\r\n\r\nI decided not to add an integration test because of the complexity involved. Because only the dataflow runner supports finalization, any integration test would require finding some way to (a) modify dataflow state and query that state (probably not a great option since it requires modifying a devs personal GCP account, and its not obvious what the best thing to do actually would be without knowing more about their config), (b) creating some sort of local endpoint for dataflow to talk back to (technically feasible, but definitely non-trivial - would also add significant complexity outside of what we're actually testing), or (c) using some 3rd party to communicate between the 2 (non-ideal since it adds an extra dependency that isn't part of what's being tested just for this scenario). I'm definitely open to doing this, but at the moment with the information I have it doesn't feel worth it.\r\n\r\n**Next Steps**\r\n\r\nAfter this, I'll update the documentation here to include an example https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/6438626c059c19ff9ca32cd834d0aa62253e531b/website/www/site/content/en/documentation/programming-guide.md#127-bundle-finalization-bundle-finalization\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't have a well defined automated system for staying on top of pull request reviews - we rely on contributors being able to find the correct OWNERS file and committers manually triaging/calling attention to old pull requests. This is the continuation of an effort to improve our automation around this.

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual

[Beam Quickstart for Java](http://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/17033/get-started/quickstart-java/index.html)\r\n\r\n* Document Maven-to-Gradle conversion for DataflowRunner.\r\n* Create TODOs for other runner conversion steps.\r\n* Change Gradle guidance to show Kotlin instead of Groovy.\r\n* Tighten up writing and remove unnecessary stuff (too much wordz).\r\n* Make numbering of procedures consistent.\r\n* Remove command prompts (`$`, `PS>`) from commands, to make them easier to copy.\r\n* Normalize line length in markdown.\r\n* Simplify Gradle execute task so that it reads from `--args` instead of `-D exec.args`\r\n* Update sample text creation step to use text of \"King Lear\", which is the same as the default for DirectRunner.\r\n\r\nI think this is a lot more streamlined, but let me know...
