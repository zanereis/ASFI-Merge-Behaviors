In the original setup method, it creates a task and create the used segments and unused segments before every test runs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first test `testRetrieveUsedSegmentsAction` only tries to assert the retrieved used segments are the same as the original created used segments. The second test `testRetrieveUnusedSegmentsAction` tries to assert the retrieved unused segments are the same as the original created unused segments. We do not need create the used and unused segments every time. Thus, we can just create them only once before all tests run. Another way can be create the used segments for the first test only and create the unused segments for the second test only.\r\n\r\nBesides, when we inspect the code inside, `action.perform` will just make a copy of used / unused segments and it does not modify the existing fields in this test class.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nFixes a regression from #15505 for nested fields which contain only empty arrays. That PR was a bit focused on top level array columns but it introduced an error for nested paths, which always write the type bytes. The changes in #15505 would result in writing an empty type byte for the field, so now steps are taken to ensure that will never be the case, and if we get to the point of writing out a type byte, it will be populated with an array type if the empty array flag is set.\r\n\r\nThe added test would fail since the empty type byte would not be convertible to an `ExpressionType`, resulting in a failure of the 'fromColumnTypeStrict' method.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not

Description\r\nIt is occasionally possible for a task running with the KubernetesTaskRunner to unsuccessfully push its status.json or for K8s to delete the log of the task before the overlord can pull it.\r\n\r\nThis can happen if a pod is evicted due to memory or disk pressure. The thing to do in response to this is check K8s events/metrics but the error messages in druid are not very clear.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly, when the overlord is unable to pull task logs, it uploads a empty log file which never gets deleted b/c the log file deleter ignores empty files.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n- Update error taskStatus when status.json is not found.\r\n- Push a explanatory log if the task log is not found.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Some QOL changes to mmless ingestion\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with the long string pair serde where null and empty strings are treated equivalently, and the return value is always null. When 'useDefaultValueForNull' was set to true by default, this wasn't a commonly seen issue, because nulls were equivalent to empty strings. However, since the default has changed to false, this can create incorrect results when the long string pairs are serded, where the empty strings are incorrectly converted to nulls.\r\n\r\nOriginal behavior:\r\n\r\n| value | deserialize(serialize(value)) | round trip is same |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| new SerializablePairLongString(123, null) | new SerializablePairLongString(123, null) | Yes, behaviour is correct |\r\n| new SerializablePairLongString(123, \"\") | new SerializablePairLongString(123, null) | No, behaviour is incorrect | \r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n| value | deserialize(serialize(value)) | round trip is same |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| new SerializablePairLongString(123, null) | new SerializablePairLongString(123, null) | Yes, behaviour is correct |\r\n| new SerializablePairLongString(123, \"\") | new SerializablePairLongString(123, \"\") | Yes, behaviour is correct | \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nNote, this now opens up possibilities of reading and writing with the different versions of the serdes - the new serde can deserialize the serialized value from the older serde, and the older serde can deserialize the value from the newer serde (during cluster upgrade and rollback)\r\n\r\nThe behavior in those cases will be: \r\n(note: P(123, null) is equivalent to new SerializablePairLongString(123, null))\r\n\r\n\r\n* serialize using new, deserialize using old\r\n   * value: P(123, null)\r\n      * original behaviour -> deserializeOld(serializeOld(P(123, null))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * deserializeOld(serializeNew(P(123, null))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * Behaviour matches the original behaviour\r\n   * value: P(123, \"\")\r\n      * original behaviour -> deserializeOld(serializeOld(P(123, \"\"))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * deserializeOld(serializeNew(P(123, \"\"))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * Behaviour matches the original behavior, however is incorrect\r\n\r\n\r\n* serialize using old, deserialize using new\r\n   * value: P(123, null)\r\n      * original behaviour -> deserializeOld(serializeOld(P(123, null))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * deserializeNew(serializeOld(P(123, null))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * Behaviour matches the old behavior \r\n   * value: P(123, \"\")\r\n      * original behaviour -> deserializeOld(serializeOld(P(123, \"\"))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * deserializeNew(serializeOld(P(123, \"\"))) = P(123, null)\r\n      * Behavior matches the original behaviour, however, is incorrect. \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIf we have serialized the code using the old version of the serde, the information about \"\" strings is lost, therefore new serde cannot get that info back. It will only be helpful if the pair was serialized with the new serde. \r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR adds `JSON_QUERY_ARRAY` which is sort of like `JSON_QUERY` but instead of returning `COMPLEX<json>` for any value extracted from some json path, instead returns `ARRAY<COMPLEX<json>>`. This is currently done purely with `ExpressionVirtualColumn` via a `DirectOperatorConversion` rather than using the specialized `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` used by `JSON_VALUE` and `JSON_QUERY`, mostly because there isn't a lot of room for optimization yet, and I would rather wait until the future if we introduce specialized array column selectors than trying to extend the existing selectors of this virtual column to also handle arrays of objects.\r\n\r\nSimilar to other array handling, values which are not arrays will be coerced into single element arrays, though I am open to discussion on this, since it would seem equally valid to handle them as null values...\r\n\r\nThis allows for a lot of useful stuff like using `UNNEST` on arrays of objects, to transform an array of json objects into rows of json objects.\r\n\r\nFor example, using some data sourced from a discussion in a community slack thread, which has top level arrays of objects (would also work with nested arrays of objects at some path)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1184\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 12 01 39 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/7b1ecd93-1196-46b5-a0e5-36334856a443\">\r\n\r\nWe can use `JSON_QUERY_ARRAY` to do stuff like translate it to a separate row per object:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 12 02 33 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/e6b42909-6757-43da-bfe7-2d3f6d8df39d\">\r\n\r\n\r\nand further use `JSON_VALUE` to extract values from these objects and do stuff like group or aggregate on them:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"772\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-08 at 12 04 08 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/6912aa46-1d10-4ac9-b578-aee929de2d79\">\r\n\r\nWill add docs in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAdded `JSON_QUERY_ARRAY` which is similar to `JSON_QUERY` except the return type is always `ARRAY<COMPLEX<json>>` instead of `COMPLEX<json>`. Essentially, this function allows extracting arrays of objects from nested data and performing operations such as `UNNEST`, `ARRAY_LENGTH`, `ARRAY_SLICE`, or any other available ARRAY operations. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #15518.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nClean useless InterruptedException warn in ingestion task log\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KafkaEmitter`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR bumps up the max heap memory for unit tests from 1.5 GB to 2 GB. \r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhile looking into https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15495, I noticed that the MSQ Controller tests were consistently failing only in jdk 17 (e.g., [job-19381423068](https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/7117839945/job/19381423068) and [job-19393777007]( https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/7122105769/job/19393777007)). This is partly precipitated by the fact that jdk 17 tests have jfr profiling enabled. \r\n\r\nAnalyzing the heap dump from [job-7122105769](https://github.com/apache/druid/actions/runs/7122105769), it seems that the [ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.java](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-core/multi-stage-query/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/msq/statistics/ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.java#L100) is probably taking up too much memory with 1M rows and the jfr profiler contributes to about 6% of the strong reachable objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit tests and CI succeeded after the heap size increase: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15495/commits/c8f92d79bedaadebf7179f6b42b4308b6fb123d1\r\n\r\n\r\nOOM stacktrace from the heap dump:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain  Runnable <--- OutOfMemoryError happened in this thread Thread ID: 1\r\n  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.<init>(OutOfMemoryError.java:48)\r\n  java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.<init>(HeapByteBuffer.java:64)\r\n  java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(ByteBuffer.java:363)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.allocation.HeapMemoryAllocator$1.<init>(HeapMemoryAllocator.java:63)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.allocation.HeapMemoryAllocator.allocate(HeapMemoryAllocator.java:59)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.allocation.AppendableMemory.reserveAdditional(AppendableMemory.java:139)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.write.RowBasedFrameWriter.writeDataUsingFieldWriters(RowBasedFrameWriter.java:275)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.write.RowBasedFrameWriter.writeData(RowBasedFrameWriter.java:246)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.write.RowBasedFrameWriter.addSelection(RowBasedFrameWriter.java:122)\r\n  org.apache.druid.frame.key.KeyTestUtils.createKey(KeyTestUtils.java:104)\r\n  org.apache.druid.msq.statistics.ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.createKey(ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.java:659)\r\n  org.apache.druid.msq.statistics.ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.lambda$test_clusterByX_unique$0(ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.java:107)\r\n  org.apache.druid.msq.statistics.ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest$$Lambda$2714+0x00007fa380e5e248.apply()\r\n  java.util.stream.LongPipeline$1$1.accept(LongPipeline.java:177)\r\n  java.util.stream.Streams$RangeLongSpliterator.tryAdvance(Streams.java:207)\r\n  java.util.Spliterator$OfLong.tryAdvance(Spliterator.java:752)\r\n  java.util.stream.StreamSpliterators$WrappingSpliterator.lambda$initPartialTraversalState$0(StreamSpliterators.java:292)\r\n  java.util.stream.StreamSpliterators$WrappingSpliterator$$Lambda$389+0x00007fa3804c7398.getAsBoolean()\r\n  java.util.stream.StreamSpliterators$AbstractWrappingSpliterator.fillBuffer(StreamSpliterators.java:206)\r\n  java.util.stream.StreamSpliterators$AbstractWrappingSpliterator.doAdvance(StreamSpliterators.java:169)\r\n  java.util.stream.StreamSpliterators$WrappingSpliterator.tryAdvance(StreamSpliterators.java:298)\r\n  java.util.Spliterators$1Adapter.hasNext(Spliterators.java:681)\r\n  com.google.common.collect.Iterators.addAll(Iterators.java:365)\r\n  com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList(Lists.java:146)\r\n  com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList(Lists.java:132)\r\n  org.apache.druid.msq.statistics.ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.doTest(ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.java:572)\r\n  org.apache.druid.msq.statistics.ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.test_clusterByX_unique(ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImplTest.java:113)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\nFixes a bug with 'auto' column indexer when the column being processed contains only arrays without strong type information, such as `[]` or `[null, null]` etc, which previously would be stored generically as `COMPLEX<json>` typed. This however isn't very chill since this overrides any other type in the SQL schema, so instead we now choose `ARRAY<LONG>`, which is the most restrictive array type and easily coerced to the other array types. This allows segments with columns that only have empty or null containing arrays to still be handled as array types, using array functions and things like `UNNEST`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nColumns ingested with the `auto` column indexer that contain only empty or null containing arrays are now stored as `ARRAY<LONG>` instead of `COMPLEX<json>`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been

Description\r\nThe equality filter allows automatic coercion of scalar typed columns to array columns to help assist schema migration between mvds and arrays, as well as scalars to arrays, where the scalar inputs are treated as single element arrays for the purposes of matching.\r\n\r\nHowever, this had an unintended side-effect of allowing the reverse that impacts only native queries, allowing using an equality filter with a scalar match value to match single element arrays of array columns, which is pretty strange (and json_value using SQL).\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the equality filter (and array indexes) to no longer allow matching single element arrays in columns with scalar values, while preserving the opposite, where scalar columns can match single element arrays.\r\n\r\nThis has a side-effect that strictly impacts native query equality filter on mixed type 'auto' columns which contain arrays, that they must now be interacted with as their presenting type, so if any rows are arrays, e.g. the segment metadata and information_schema reports the type as some array type, then the native queries must also filter as if they are some array type. This does not impact SQL, which already has this limitation due to how the type presents itself, and again only impacts mixed type 'auto' columns.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNative query `equals` filter on mixed type 'auto' columns which contain arrays must now be filtered as their presenting type, so if any rows are arrays (e.g. the segment metadata and information_schema reports the type as some array type), then the native queries must also filter as if they are some array type. This does not impact SQL, which already has this limitation due to how the type presents itself, and again only impacts mixed type 'auto' columns which contain both scalars and arrays.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR

Description \r\n\r\nWith `CentralizedDatasourceSchema` (https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989) feature enabled, metadata for appended segments was not being refreshed. This caused `numRows` to be 0 for the new segments and would probably cause the datasource schema to not include columns from the new segments. \r\n\r\n### Analysis \r\nThe problem turned out in the new QuerySegmentWalker implementation in the Coordinator. It first finds the segment to be queried in the Coordinator timeline. Then it creates a new timeline of the segments present in the timeline.  \r\nThe problem was that it is looking up complete partition set in the new timeline. Since the appended segments by themselves do not make a complete partition set, no SegmentMetadataQuery were executed. \r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nThe fix is to lookup incomplete partition set in the new timeline. It is consistent with the logic in `CachingClusteredClient` for querying specific segments (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/client/CachingClusteredClient.java#L429). \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the MSQ engine requires ingest queries to generate output rows.  A DML query that doesn't produces any output rows will result in an `InsertCannotBeEmpty` MSQ fault, requiring a user to validate and adjust their query so that the query produces non-empty rows to succeed. \r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\n- Introduce a new query context `failOnEmptyInsert`, which defaults to false.\r\n- When `failOnEmptyInsert` is:\r\n     - `false`, the default behavior after this patch, MSQE will allow empty ingest queries. An empty INSERT is essentially a no-op, and an empty REPLACE will delete all data that matches the OVERWRITE clause.\r\n     - `true`, MSQE will throw the existing `InsertCannotBeEmpty` MSQ fault.\r\n\r\n**Implementation**:\r\n- The controller query kernel has a method `isStageOutputEmpty(int stageId)` that determines if a stage output is empty, non-empty or unknown using the cluster key statistics.\r\n- For a `REPLACE ALL` query over an existing `ALL` grain segment, the query will generate a tombstone spanning eternity which will be removed eventually be the coordinator [duty](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15281), so subsequent data can be appended. This would be effectively similar to a `DELETE` table command as the eternity tombstone will mask all the underlying data.\r\n- Add unit tests in `MSQInsertTest`, `MSQReplaceTest` to test the new default behavior (i.e., when `failOnEmptyInsert = false`)\r\n- Update unit tests in MSQFaultsTest to test the non-default behavior (i.e., when `failOnEmptyInsert = true`)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an implementation of `AuditManager` that simply logs the audit events instead of persisting them to metadata store.\r\n\r\n### Sample audit log\r\n#### Setup\r\nAuthentication: none\r\n`druid.audit.manager.type=log`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n2023-12-08T14:20:07,403 WARN [qtp972079939-170] org.apache.druid.server.audit.AuditLogger - \r\nUser[console], identity[allowAll], IP[127.0.0.1] performed action[rules]\r\n on key[inline_data] with comment[Load 2 replicas in the default tier].\r\n Request[null],\r\n payload[[{\"tieredReplicants\":{\"_default_tier\":2},\"useDefaultTierForNull\":true,\"type\":\"loadForever\"}]].\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `log` implementation for `AuditManager` alongwith `SQLAuditManager`\r\n- `LoggingAuditManager` simply logs the audit event. Thus, it returns empty for all `fetchAuditHistory` calls\r\n- Add new config `druid.audit.manager.type` which can take values `log`, `sql` (default)\r\n- Add new config `druid.audit.manager.logLevel` which can take values `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`. This gets activated only if `type` is `log`.\r\n- Remove usage of `ConfigSerde` from `AuditManager` as audit is not just limited to configs\r\n- Add `AuditSerdeHelper` for a single implementation of serialization/deserialization of audit payload that can be used by different `AuditManager` implementations\r\n\r\n### How is audit performed\r\nAll existing and new audited REST API endpoints accept two headers `X-Druid-Author` and `X-Druid-Comment` which are being used to populate the audit info. The web-console currently passes `console` as the value for `X-Druid-Author`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this can be to extract the authentication result set as an attribute in the `HttpServletRequest` and invoke `authenticationResult.getIdentity()`.\r\n\r\n### New audited endpoints\r\n- Post a task `type=ingestion.batch`\r\n- Mark segments as unused: `type=markSegmentsAsUnused`\r\n- Kill segments: `type=killSegments`\r\n- Create user in basic authenticator: `type=basicAuth.createUser`\r\n- Delete user in basic authenticator: `type=basicAuth.deleteUser`\r\n- Update user in basic authenticator: `type=basicAuth.updateUserCreds`\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n- Add new config `druid.audit.manager.type` which can take values `log`, `sql`(default). This allows audited events to either be logged or persisted in metadata store (default behaviour).\r\n- Add new config `druid.audit.manager.logLevel` which allows users to set the log level of audit events and can take values `DEBUG`, `INFO`(default), `WARN`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nThe initial step in optimizing segment metadata was to centralize the construction of datasource schema in the Coordinator (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14985). Subsequently, our goal is to eliminate the requirement for regularly executing queries to obtain segment schema information. This task encompasses addressing both realtime and finalized segments.\r\n\r\nThis modification specifically addresses the issue with realtime segments. Tasks will now routinely communicate the schema for realtime segments during the segment announcement process. The Coordinator will identify the schema alongside the segment announcement and subsequently update the schema for realtime segments in the metadata cache.\r\n\r\n## Design \r\n\r\n### Task\r\n- New method, `Sink.getSignature` to return the RowSignature of the Sink by coming the signature of each `FireHydrant`. \r\n- Periodically, the `StreamAppenderator.SinkSchemaAnnouncer` will compute sink schema changes and announce them to the `DataSegmentAnnouncer`.\r\n- New APIs have been introduced in `DataSegmentAnnouncer` to receive sink schema information and manage schema cleanup when a task is closed.\r\n- A new Pojo named `SegmentSchemas` has been added to facilitate the passing of schema information for multiple segments.\r\n- A new implementation of `DataSegmentChangeRequest` has been introduced, named `SegmentSchemasChangeRequest`.\r\n\r\n### Coordinator\r\n- Modifications have been made to the `HttpServerInventoryView` to handle schema information.\r\n- `Schema Update Flow`: `HttpServerInventoryView` -> `CoordinatorServerView` -> `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache`.  \r\n- The `CoordinatorSegmentMetadata` cache has been updated to incorporate schema changes. Changes have also been made to the refresh logic to eliminate the need for executing segment metadata queries for realtime segments.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Added UTs. \r\n* Tested it locally with wikipedia dataset and kafka based ingestion. \r\n* Tested in a druid cluster, verified the datasource signature and numRows for realtime segments.\r\n\r\n## Potential side effects \r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Limitations \r\n\r\nCurrently, this feature doesn't work with zookeeper based segment announcement. \r\n\r\n## Upgrade considerations\r\n\r\nThe general upgrade order should be followed. The new code is behind a feature flag, so it is compatible with existing setups. Even if centralized datasource schema building (https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14985) is enabled, realtime segments will be refreshed using segment metadata query to Indexer/Task. \r\n\r\nThis experimental feature aims to eliminate the necessity for periodically executing the SegmentMetadataQuery to the Indexer/Task for retrieving the schema of realtime segments. Presently, it is accessible through two feature flags and should only be enabled for **Proof of Concept (PoC)** or **testing purposes**. To activate it, configure the following settings in the common configurations: `druid.centralizedDatasourceSchema.enabled` and `druid.centralizedDatasourceSchema.announceRealtimeSegmentSchema`. It's important to note that the feature flag is temporary `druid.centralizedDatasourceSchema.announceRealtimeSegmentSchema` and will be removed in a subsequent update.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIn MSQ, each partition corresponds to a single segment (if it is the end stage) or the unit of work that is assigned to a worker. If the clustering key has low cardinality, then the returned partitions can be too large. For certain stages, we can break up the resulting partitions by introducing a synthetic clustering column \"__boost\" (which should contain a unique value - incrementally increasing longs for MSQ's implementation) at the end of the clustering keys, so that the keys become unique, and the partition boundaries are respectable. This is done in ScanQueryKit, and can be done in the GroupByPostShuffleFrameProcessor.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces this partition boosting to the group by queries as well. \r\n\r\nFor example, the queries of the form\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO table\r\nSELECT dim1, dim2, agg(metric1) as aggregated FROM EXTERN(...)\r\nGROUP BY dim1, dim2\r\nPARTITIONED BY YEAR\r\nCLUSTERED BY aggregated\r\n```\r\ncan run into large segments if the \"aggregated\" is a very low cardinality column, and the (dim1, dim2) is a high cardinality pair. The solution (before the patch) would be to add more dims into the CLUSTERED BY clause to make it more unique. Post this patch, that won't be required.\r\nControllerImpl already handles partition-boosted columns specially. \r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Group by queries can fail during the cluster upgrade, if some of the workers are on an older version, while the others are on a newer version. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR aims to introduce Window functions on MSQ by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a Window querykit for handling window queries along with its factory and a processor for window queries\r\n2. If a window operator is present with a partition by clause, pushes the partition as a shuffle spec of the previous stage\r\n3. In presence of empty OVER() clause lets all operators loose on a single rac\r\n4. In presence of no empty OVER() clause, breaks down each window into individual stages\r\n5. Associated machinery to handle window functions in MSQ\r\n6. Introduced a separate hidden engine feature `WINDOW_LEAF_OPERATOR` which is set only for MSQ engine. In presence of this feature, the planner plans without the leaf operators by creating a window query over an inner scan query. In case of native this is set to false and the planner generates the leafOperators\r\n7. Guardrails around materialization\r\n8. Comprehensive UTs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nAdd support in MSQE to run window functions using a context flag `enableWindowing:true`. In the native engine, we need a group by clause to enable window functions. In the MSQE the requirement of providing a mandatory group by clause to enable window functions is removed.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

method has been problematic in the past, where a not-so-careful invocation can lead to the iterator generating an excessive number of intervals. This, in turn, can either lead to heavy CPU usage or heavy memory pressure. In discussions with @imply-cheddar / @cheddar, we settled on this approach where the code forces the caller to specify a limit.  If exceeded, the iterator will throw an error but at least will keep services resilient. \r\n\r\nThe PR is a draft as I still need to determine the correct limit in various places. \r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Background\r\n\r\nThe segment allocation algorithm reuses an already allocated pending segment if the new allocation request is made for the same parameters:\r\n- datasource\r\n- sequence name\r\n- same interval\r\n- same value of `skipSegmentLineageCheck` (`false` for batch append, `true` for streaming append)\r\n- same previous segment id (used only when `skipSegmentLineageCheck = false`)\r\n\r\nThe above parameters can thus uniquely identify a pending segment (enforced by the UNIQUE constraint on the `sequence_name_prev_id_sha1` column in `druid_pendingSegments` metadata table).\r\n\r\nThis reuse is done in order to\r\n- allow replica tasks (in case of streaming ingestion) to use the same set of segment IDs.\r\n- allow re-run of a failed batch task to use the same segment ID and prevent unnecessary allocations\r\n\r\n### Breaking scenario\r\n- Append task T1 allocates pending segment against version V1. Let's call this pending segment `pendingV11`\r\n- T1 fails and is unable to commit `pendingV11`\r\n- Replace task T2 commits a new version V2 which overshadows V1.\r\n- Append task T3 picks up from where T1 had failed. T3 thus tries to reuse `pendingV11`.\r\n- T3 completes and commits `pendingV11` as `segmentV11` even though it belongs to an already overshadowed version.\r\n- `segmentV11` gets immediately marked as unused and eventually deleted thus causing loss of the appended data\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n- A pending segment must always be allocated for the latest version of committed (used) segments in that interval.\r\n- If a pending segment already exists but belongs to an older version, do not reuse it. It will eventually be cleaned up by the coordinator.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add the version of the allocated segment to the set of parameters that uniquely define a pending segment\r\n- Thus for a given datasource, interval, sequence, prev_segment_id, there can be multiple pending segments, but each of them must have a different version.\r\n- Include the version while calculating the hash `sequence_name_prev_id_sha1` thus preserving the UNIQUE constraint\r\n- Add test to assert above behaviour. This test would fail without the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Alternate approach\r\nClean up pending segments as soon as they are not needed. It is difficult to ensure that a pending segment is not currently in use as multiple tasks might be using the same segment id.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nFix bug in segment allocation that can potentially cause loss of appended data when running interleaved append and replace tasks.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR tries to address a UX confusion where the console goes into \"no management proxy mode\" when in-fact the coordinator leader can simply not be determined in a transitive state. This is because right now the console relies on havign `/proxy/coordinator/status` return 200 to know that the management proxy is enabled. But that call might fail even when the management proxy is on.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I add a `/proxy/enabled` endpoint that simply returns `{\"enabled\":true}` and retool the console to use that route instead. Also I allow for a code 400 to indicate that the management proxy is running.","created_at":"2023-11-29T19:54:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:43:49Z","closed_at":"2023-11-30T05:43:42Z","merged_at":"2023-11-30T05:43:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"31fa63e7894e7e18bcaec7c98f27ef4d71b6fbfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This PR adds a default implementation in the interface which allows the evalDimension to return value as a Singleton array of eval result. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ... \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13947 is a breaking change for custom transform RowFunction implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Renamed the class ... \r\nNone\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nNone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nThis PR removes a some stuff that was only used by group-by v1, which was removed in #14866, simplifying `IncrementalIndex` and `OnHeapIncrementalIndex` implementations. The removed parameters are:\r\n* `deserializeComplexMetrics` which is always true (was false in group-by v1)\r\n* `concurrentEventAdd` which is always false (was true in group-by v1)\r\n*  and `sortFacts` which is always true (could be false in group-by v1)\r\n\r\nRemoving the parameters allowed simplifying stuff like `FactsHolder` and some other things. I've also moved the two `FactsHolder` implementations to `OnHeapIncrementalIndex` where they are actually used (no logic change here, just a simple move), assuming that any other implementations would bring their own `FactsHolder` implementation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n- Licenses file contains several licenses for outdated libraries. In this PR we remove licenses for no longer used components. \r\nThis change is purely cosmetic / cleans up the license database. \r\nThe candidates were designated by reviewing the output of the license check script and comparing it against the depdency tree. \r\n - Minor fix to license check tool to fail more gracefully when the license of used dependency is not listed as known, as well as fix not to fail on multi licensed components when at least one of the licenses is accepted. \r\n \r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR enables the flag by default to queue excess query requests in the jetty queue. Still keeping the flag so that it can be turned off if necessary. But the flag will be removed in the future. \r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n- When query scheduler threads are less than server HTTP threads, total laning becomes on. This lets reserve some HTTP threads for non-query requests such as health checks. The total laning previously would reject any query request that exceeds the lane capacity. But now, those excess requests will instead be queued with a timeout equal to `MIN(Integer.MAX_VALUE, druid.server.http.maxQueryTimeout`)\r\n\r\nif value of `druid.server.http.maxQueryTimeout` is negative, then the excess requests will be queued forever. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen trying to merge the higher order group by results on broker (primarily), and perhaps on historicals (under special conditions when we push the subquery down to the historical), a deadlock can occur depending on the structure of the query.\r\nThe primary cause of this deadlock is that currently, we are trying to acquire the merge buffer resources at two places - `GroupByQueryQueryToolchest` (which is the place where we merge the higher-level results from the runners), and at `GroupByMergingQueryRunnerV2` (to merge the results from the runners of the multiple segments). These two were incorrectly considered to be mutually exclusive till now:\r\n1. `GroupByQueryQueryToolchest` - Acquires the merge buffers on the brokers only, as the historicals get the query wit the subqueries and the grouping sets to null, therefore this doesn't acquire any merge buffers. However, this might not be true, because when we push down the subquery itself, the historicals will also acquire the merge buffers at this place.\r\n2. `GroupByMergingQueryRunnerV2` - Acquires merge buffers on the historicals only, as it primarily merges the results from the query runners that run on the segments. This is also incorrect because the broker can act as a data server itself when the data source is an inline data source, and we attempt to run nested group bys on that. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we have conditions when the `GroupByQueryQueryToolchest` is holding some merge buffers to merge the results of the returned runners, however, the runner itself is `GroupByMergingQueryRunnerV2` (or a decorated runner on top of it), and it also requires merge buffers to merge the \"segment-level\" runners to provide to the mergeResults of the toolchest. As we donot acquire the resources in a single go, following situations happen:\r\n\r\nTotal merge buffers on the broker: 2\r\nQueryA = QueryB = A query that needs 1 merge buffer to `merge results` (in toolchest), and 1 mergeBuffer for `GroupByMergingQueryRunnerV2` on the broker\r\nQueryA & QueryB are running simultaneously on the cluster\r\n\r\n| Time | QueryA actions | QueryB actions | Buffers in system\r\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 0 |  | | 2 |\r\n| 1 | toolchest acquires 1 buffer | | 1 |\r\n| 2 | | toolchest acquires 1 buffer | 0 |\r\n| 3 | mergingRunner acquires 1 buffer (blocked) | | 0 |\r\n| 4 | | mergingRunner acquires 1 buffer (blocked) | 0 |\r\n\r\nThe queries could have passed in isolation, however now they are waiting on the other to release the single merge buffer they hold to proceed. \r\n\r\nThis PR prevents such a deadlock from happening by acquiring the merge buffers in a single place and passing it down to the runner that might need it. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, some tests check for a specific ordering of elements in JSON strings. JSON objects are equal even if the ordering of the elements in the JSON strings are not equal. This results in flakiness as the Jackson ObjectMapper does not guarantee consistent ordering of the JSON keys.\r\n\r\nThus, when the NonDex tool shuffles the HashSet elements and the JSON keys, it results in test failures:\r\nErrors can be found in this Github issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15471\r\n\r\nTo reproduce run:\r\n```\r\nmvn -pl <module_name> edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=<test_name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nThis PR updates the 'auto' schema to add a new `castToType` parameter which accepts a `ColumnType` to allow forcing the 'auto' indexer to cast values to a specific type. One of the main use cases for this is MSQ array ingestion, which can now specify the exact desired type, but also allows known type columns to use all of the new features provided by 'auto' columns such as numeric indexes and array type columns for any other native ingestion. This only works for primitive/primitive array types, and will be ignored if any other type is used. The column part serde stores an extra `enforceLogicalType` which is used to ensure the correct casting schema is created for stuff like auto-compaction.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\ntbd\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
