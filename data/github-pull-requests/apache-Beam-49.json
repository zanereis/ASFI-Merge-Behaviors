PR serves to inform potential root cause of #26981. There seems to be a history of back and forth removal and reversion of `ClassLoadingStrategy.Default.INJECTION`, most recently #25578.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides some validation that reversion of `ClassLoadingStrategy.Default.INJECTION` removal resolved the `IllegalArgumentException`.  However, given the said history, a non-breaking solution needs to be determined that this PR does not solve.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`writeFn` implementation in the `bigqueryio` package (part of the Go SDK) may lose rows when attempting to insert a large amount of data.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/843e7fdb239e0a61b47e39ce635c37221cd09f4e/sdks/go/pkg/beam/io/bigqueryio/bigquery.go#L328-L344\r\n\r\nThe loop iterates over the elements of the given PCollection. For each `val` it encounters it either puts the current batch into BigQuery or appends `val` to the current batch. If `val` is about to make the current batch go over BigQuery's limitations, the batch is put into BigQuery. But, the `val` is then not included in the next batch.\r\n\r\nHere is a simplified example: https://play.golang.com/p/_3Enne857Rh vs https://play.golang.com/p/-OaX3HpPZkd. Notice that with the first code \"f\" is missed. But in the second code \"f\" is included in the second batch.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the contents of the `else` block outside of the conditional flow. When a batch is put into BigQuery, the accumulators are reset (marking the start of a new batch) and then immediately `val` is included in the new batch.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

in a long standing gap in the proto documentation, by explicitly including the source and sink transforms among the StandardPTransform primitives.\r\n\r\nI suspect a reason it went on so long without is that the Urns are largely in the Runner Proto, but everything about the transform is tied to the FnAPI implementation.\r\n\r\nSince we no longer expect alternative FnAPI impelementations in Beam V2 that are not GRPC based, it's time to fill that gap.\r\n\r\nFixes #27435 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue:**\r\n\r\nAs per the specifications, BigQuery is capable of receiving timestamps up to `9999-12-31T23:59:59`. \r\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#timestamp_type\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the `java.time.Instant.until`. https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=8199095\r\n\r\nThis causes there is an overflow issue with timestamps beyond `2262-04-11T23:47:16Z`. This prevents correct processing of timestamps beyond this point.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/v2.48.0/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/TableRowToStorageApiProto.java#L764\r\n\r\n```\r\nErrorMessage: org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.bigquery.TableRowToStorageApiProto$SchemaDoesntMatchException: Problem converting field root.COLUMN_NAME expected type: TIMESTAMP. Exception: java.lang.ArithmeticException: long overflow\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\n`Instant.until` calculates the period using `ChronoUnit.UNIT.between`. `ChronoUnit.MICROS.between` will multiply 1000_000_000(=Instant.NANOS_PER_SECOND) to the micro-second based Instant object and convert it to nano-second based one. \r\nhttps://github.com/frohoff/jdk8u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/java/time/Instant.java#L1149 \r\n\r\nThis means, the maximum timestamp which `ChronoUnit.MICROS.between` can handle is\r\n\r\n- long.max = 9223372036854775807\r\n- Timestamp(long.max, UNIT.NANO) ~ 2262-04-11T23:47:16Z\r\n\r\n`TableRowToStorageApiProto.singularFieldToProtoValue` will use `ChronoUnit.MICROS.between(Instant.EPOCH, Instant.from(timestamp)`. This will be overflowed if timestamp > `2262-04-11T23:47:16Z` and it throw `java.lang.ArithmeticException: long overflow`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**Proposed Fix:**\r\n\r\nThis pull request applies a workaround to the section of code where the overflow occurs. With this fix, the StorageWriteAPI can correctly transmit timestamps up to `9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999 UTC` as originally intended by BigQuery's specifications.\r\n\r\n**Workaround:**\r\n\r\nBigQueryIO can accept an Epoch timestamp in microsecond as long type. For example, \"1970-01-01T00:01:01.000041Z\" as string -> 61000041L.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR addresses #27088 by supporting an environment variable type. The value of this pattern is that it minimizes errors when deploying Go applications on a Kubernetes cluster. As the environment variable key and value are both strings, a common error is to refer to the key instead of its value.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the API Overuse Study (see proposal referenced in issue) is to simulate a quota aware API. In order to do so within a Dataflow runner context, the endpoint needs to be deployed on Google Cloud. Kubernetes is the obvious architecture of choice and is most compatible with using environment variables over command-line arguments.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
