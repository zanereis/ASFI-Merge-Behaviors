`breeze testing tests --test-type \"Providers[...]\"` command would fail for an invalid `project-name` for `docker compose` if the provider(s) specified required a dotted path (e.g. `microsoft.azure`, `dbt.cloud`, etc.).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```bash\r\n~/code/airflow\r\n> breeze testing tests --test-type \"Providers[dbt.cloud]\"\r\nDocker filesystem: apfs\r\nGood version of Docker: 20.10.21.\r\nGood version of docker-compose: 2.13.0\r\nGood Docker context used: default.\r\n\"airflow-test-providers_dbt.cloud\" is not a valid project name\r\n\"airflow-test-providers_dbt.cloud\" is not a valid project name\r\n\"airflow-test-providers_dbt.cloud\" is not a valid project name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes the `project-name` generation in Breeze when using the `Providers` test type for those dotted-path providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Patch the MockExecutor into the executor list within test code rather than core/prod code.\r\n\r\nFull story: The MockExecutor, which is used for testing, was added to the list of executors in \"production\"/core code in #27941\r\nThis can lead to that mock executor being loaded at runtime once Airflow is installed (when the `tests/test_utils/...` code is no longer present) and the import/load fails (new code I'm adding in a separate PR hits this case). So patch within test code instead of prod code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

we skipped all integration tests in non-main builds (i.e. builds that were running in v2-* branches where we test and prepare releases. This had two effects:\r\n\r\n* the non-provider integration tests were not run before release, which could have revealed some problems\r\n* constraint generation was skipped for those runs because constraint generation depended on integration tests\r\n\r\nThis is now fixed:\r\n\r\n* integration tests are run on non-main builds\r\n* but all provider tests are skipped there\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

takes a callable that would be invoked when the XComArg is resolved. Once implemented an example DAG would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\n\r\nvalue = ...  # Get some JSON string maybe from API.\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task2(obj: dict):\r\n    print(obj[\"id\"])\r\n\r\ntask2(value.convert(json.loads))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, this is already possible right now by putting `json.loads` in a task, either merged into the task that received `value`, the one that does processing (`task2`), or a separate one in between. But this is useful if both the tasks before and after are classic operators (i.e. relatively cumbersome to extend), and you don’t want an extra task for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nNote that, unlike `map()`, since the callable is applied to the arg as a whole, the return value may no longer be expandable. Therefore we would raise an error if the value is used for task-mapping.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Correctly handle `NotExpandable` so the scheduler does not crash when `convert` is used incorrectly.\r\n- [ ] Tests.\r\n- [ ] Add documentation on the taskflow topic page.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T09:51:05Z","updated_at":"2023-03-11T00:11:06Z","closed_at":"2023-03-11T00:11:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27560531676820f7cfdb1ac8bfbab7e1b2de56e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Amazon Provider documentation and Hooks docstrings with references to [Intersphinx Inventory](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html)\r\n\r\n1. Make Hooks docstring more consistant to each other. Mark each hook which is intend to be a wrapper to boto3 client/resource is it **Thin** (provide only arguments described in AwsBaseHook) wrapper or **Think** (contain additional arguments in constructor)\r\n2. Add links to appropriate boto3 client/resource method/class in hooks methods doctrings, if applicable\r\n3. Remove useless type hinting for params / returns in docstring - we have annotation for that.\r\n4. Most of the references use prefix `:external+boto3:` for avoid overlapping with botocore inventory, we do not use this inventory yet.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a few changes, if someone interested I

closes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/28120\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe have been using Airflow with Celery executor on EKS to schedule up to 8,000 task instances per day on production data pipeline, and suffered from task instances stuck in `queued` status.\r\n\r\nOn average, we found 1~3 task instances stuck in `queued` states per day, and those tasks did not conform execution_timeout or write any task logs, because they had not been launched by any celery worker!\r\n\r\nI found logic for handling similar issues on `KubernetesExecutor`'s method: `clear_not_launched_queued_tasks()`\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/executors/kubernetes_executor.py#L495\r\n\r\nSo, I had made a custom DAG and task to perform similar operation(find tasks stuck in queued status, and re-schedule those by updating state field to `scheduled` with sqlalchemy query (like `{TaskInstance.state: State.SCHEDULED}`)\r\n\r\nthis DAG works very well for the last few months, but on last Friday, we got very funny situation that task instance of this custom DAG was stuck in queued state. so, I guess this checking logic will be better if it is located on the executor code side with airflow built-in `sched` based scheduler(`EventScheduler`), like KubernetesExecutor.\r\n\r\nIf we know the root cause of this problem, there will be more elegant solution. but, I read some related issues linked above, and guess there is not just one reason to make stuck tasks, case by case. (Some parts of this issue is marked as fixed, but the issues remains consistently to latest release (`v2.5`)\r\n-

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/28933\r\n\r\n`@task.kubernetes` currently does not handle receiving input nor does it properly return output. This PR addresses these issues by passing input to the K8's pod (via an env var) and output where the K8's xcom sidecar expects it (as /airflow/xcom/result.json).\r\n\r\nIt also seemed like the initial implementation did not properly base64 encode / decode the values. Since there might be unusual characters / line breaks in both the function and inputs, I added base64 encoding to the env var setting (similar to how it's handled in  [docker](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2.5.0/airflow/providers/docker/decorators/docker.py#L50)). \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTo test, I started Airflow w/ breeze (`breeze --python 3.9 --backend postgres start-airflow`), added a google_cloud_default connection_id to my sandbox GCP project, and copied my kube_config file to /files/.kube/config. Because I am using GCP, I needed to install gcloud. I do so with the following commands in the breeze shell:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl -sSL https://sdk.cloud.google.com > /tmp/gcloud_installer && bash /tmp/gcloud_installer --install-dir=$AIRFLOW_HOME --disable-prompts\r\nsource /root/airflow/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc\r\nsource /root/airflow/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then ran this test DAG:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import task\r\n\r\nDEFAULT_TASK_ARGS = {\r\n    \"owner\": \"gcp-data-platform\",\r\n    \"start_date\": \"2022-12-16\",\r\n
