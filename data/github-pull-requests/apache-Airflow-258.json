sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5417\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe current workflow of creating an app in views.py is:\r\n\r\n1. Create one DB session\r\n2. Assign it to flask-appbuilder, use the session to help initializing the app.\r\n3. Create DagBag\r\n4. **Reuse the same session** to add permission using flask-appbuilder etc.\r\n    - Reason for us reusing the session is because we use the `scoped_session` w/o a scope function, thus made the session a [thread-local scope session](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/contextual.html#thread-local-scope), which will be reused until it is removed. Unfortunately flask-appbuilder doesn't remove the session after a query, [e.g. 1](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/master/flask_appbuilder/security/sqla/manager.py#L371).\r\n\r\nProblem with this is that if during step 3, there's a DB disconnect, step 4 will fail because the session is still attached with the disconnected DB connection and not rolled back. It becomes a bigger problem if step 3 regularly takes a long time, more than the DB connection expire time, step 4 will always fail, which is the case for us currently.\r\n\r\nTried to move the import of views.py to the outer scope but that seem to fail multiple tests. The approach here is to remove the session from the registry and the next session call will just create a new one automatically.\r\n\r\nOf course the proper way is to fix the session usage in flask-appbuilder but that would be a longer term fix.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNot really changing the behavior.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-06T03:46:04Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T18:54:24Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T21:35:15Z","merged_at":"2019-09-10T21:35:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"205db4b41feef2473585802fcda2c129ffe49099","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545564011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTY0MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:MetaDB","name":"area:MetaDB","color":"d7c1ff","default":false,"description":"Meta

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-AIRFLOW-5416\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, if a user wants to develop an airflow docker image to push to a k8s cluster, they need to re-download all airflow pip dependencies EVERY time they run `scripts/ci/kubernetes/docker/build.sh`. This PR will allow users to create a \"lower layer\" of all pip dependencies to significantly reduce build times.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-05T17:04:11Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T12:13:24Z","closed_at":"2019-09-07T14:57:23Z","merged_at":"2019-09-07T14:57:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"50523ea91478cfc4a5b2eb03bca388d0573b5ca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/6021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/6021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8c251fd2cea93450703c1ad66f8daa3966344ed7","head":{"label":"dimberman:easier-k8s-image-pushing","ref":"easier-k8s-image-pushing","sha":"8c251fd2cea93450703c1ad66f8daa3966344ed7","user":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104245736,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQyNDU3MzY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"dimberman/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n#5349 added a default pool, but I noticed the documentation wasn't changed in `concepts.rst`. This PR adds a note about `default_pool`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5402\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5402\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5403\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSince we have pre-commit and flake8 on CI there seems to be no reason to keep this bullet point in PR template.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

crash in the Airflow Ad Hoc Query menu when you hit the \".csv\" button to obtain a csv file of the query if the query is empty. This happened due to a \"**_df variable referenced before assigment_**\", the \"**_df_**\" variable is catched inside a try / except block and \"**_df_**\" is never assigned, instead there is an \"**_error_**\" variable which can be used to detect when the query was empty or the connection could not be stablished.\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot it fails in line 2295 and the \"**_error_**\" variable will be True.\r\n\r\nIn line 2317 you can see the proposed change adding \"**and not error**\"\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/KnK43hk.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n  - I didn't know exactly how to unit test this, if you have any advice I will do a test for it. Other than that, I did test checking that the behaviour was as expected:\r\n    \r\n    - [X] Querying with blank text and unset connection works with an error message\r\n    - [X]  Querying with blank text and set connection works with an error message\r\n    - [X] Querying with text and set connection works returning the .csv file\r\n    - [X] Querying with text and unset connection works returning an error message\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5396) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\"\\[AIRFLOW-5396\\] Add button to Auto Refresh Airflow UI\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5396\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, to follow up the tasks running on Airflow UI (mainly when we are at development) we should click at button \"Refresh\". When we need to know the finishing of a task we have to click many times at this button.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have a new button \"Auto Refresh\" which we could click and just wait the UI showing us the status while Airflow executes.\r\n\r\nWe can do another thing meanwhile and just return to the UI screen when it's finished.\r\n\r\nSo this button should:\r\n- when clicked start an auto refresh \r\n- when clicked again stop the auto refresh\r\n\r\nAuto Refresh disabled / initial state\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13151948/64216116-eccbca80-ce8d-11e9-802c-5eff32b2dc5f.png)\r\n\r\nAuto Refresh Enabled\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13151948/64216120-f1907e80-ce8d-11e9-954e-2ebe34026a92.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nAs it's a front/UI related PR we currently don't have unit tests then I have tested the functionality on the UI.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-04T00:05:34Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T15:29:51Z","closed_at":"2019-10-23T15:29:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e756f466a2d6053f5960547fff567dc63aed72c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/bad33f810846cadba4997deecf946dc08c42f59c","head":{"label":"LucasMMota:AIRFLOW-5396-ui-auto-refresh","ref":"AIRFLOW-5396-ui-auto-refresh","sha":"bad33f810846cadba4997deecf946dc08c42f59c","user":{"login":"LucasMMota","id":13151948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUxOTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13151948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota","html_url":"https://github.com/LucasMMota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206191226,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxOTEyMjY=","name":"airflow","full_name":"LucasMMota/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LucasMMota","id":13151948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUxOTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13151948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota","html_url":"https://github.com/LucasMMota","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucasMMota/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LucasMMota/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5395\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently you cannot `include_header` when there is a dot (for example) in the header names. To allow it, we can simply enclose the names via `\"\"`.\r\n```diff\r\n+ column_names = ', '.join('\"{0}\"'.format(c) for c in columns)\r\n- column_names = ', '.join(\"{0}\".format(c) for c in columns)\r\n+ column_castings = ', '.join('CAST(\"{0}\" AS text) AS \"{0}\"'.format(c)\r\n- column_castings = ', '.join(\"CAST({0} AS text) AS {0}\".format(c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/redshift/latest/dg/r_names\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes Pylint Issues and changes the instance attributes \"hook\" and \"s3\" to be local variables.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5088\r\n  - https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-24+DAG+Persistence+in+DB+using+JSON+for+Airflow+Webserver+and+%28optional%29+Scheduler\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n**Backport of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5743 for v1-10-* branches **\r\nBased on #5701, this PR implements functionalities including writing serialized DAGs to DB in scheduler, reading DAGs from DB in webserver, controlled by [core] dagcached\r\n\r\nThe goal is to decouple webserver from the DAG folder, instead it reads everything from database.\r\n\r\nRendering template by functions is an exception, in that case it needs to re-import DAG, because functions are stringified in serialized DAG.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\ncc @coufon

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-5390\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5390\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-03T08:04:08Z","updated_at":"2019-09-12T11:26:24Z","closed_at":"2019-09-10T13:17:04Z","merged_at":"2019-09-10T13:17:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd175fa8db222dad763ad35cedf85a750b52d4fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b592e68f7ed0bff18dbbe4b326d18e4db97afe3f","head":{"label":"Fokko:fd-provide-context-removed","ref":"fd-provide-context-removed","sha":"b592e68f7ed0bff18dbbe4b326d18e4db97afe3f","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60533353,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDUzMzM1Mw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Fokko/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5372\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nLicence check for RAT runs too often (every time pre-commit is modified) and it\r\nshould only be run (locally) when any of *LICEN[S|C]E* files change. We anyhow\r\nrun full check on CI so this is local optimisation (it runs too long while you\r\nplay with .pre-commit-config.yaml - and we will probably be able to detect some\r\nproblems locally as well when new modules are added.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-02T00:16:38Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T22:44:13Z","closed_at":"2019-09-02T15:08:49Z","merged_at":"2019-09-02T15:08:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d7bf965cc5345e4d213d5a356117f3297c6c5c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e2f32f5c5d1ba1e04a4421d8dcde905aa2c0c25f","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:license-check-only-runs-locally-when-license-change","ref":"license-check-only-runs-locally-when-license-change","sha":"e2f32f5c5d1ba1e04a4421d8dcde905aa2c0c25f","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"htt

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5369\r\n\r\nThis commit adds full interactivity to pre-commits. Whenever you run pre-commit\r\nand it detects that the image should be rebuild, an interactive question will\r\npop up instead of failing the build and asking to rebuild with REBUILD=yes\r\n\r\nThis is much nicer from the user perspective. You can choose whether to:\r\n    1) Rebuild the image (which will take some time)\r\n    2) Not rebuild the image (this will use the old image with hope it's OK)\r\n    3) Quit.\r\n\r\nAnswer to that question is carried across all images needed to rebuild.\r\nThere is the special \"build\" pre-commit hook that takes care about that.\r\n\r\n Note that this interactive question cannot be asked if you run only\r\n single pre-commit hook with Dockerfile because it can run multiple processes\r\n and you can start building in parallel. This is not desired so instead we fail\r\n such builds.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo tests for bash scripts (maybe we should add them eventually!)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-01T23:07:12Z","updated_at":"2019-09-19T22:43:22Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T11:43:31Z","merged_at":"2019-09-18T11:43:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"857788e305bbefe4566a1988e2072a21c7aab319","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/46a22e776b047a6ac501aa51922ad7b4c005a1fe","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:add-interactivity-to-pre-commits","ref":"add-interactivity-to-pre-commits","sha":"46a22e776b047a6ac501aa51922ad7b4c005a1fe","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserc

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5368\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-01T22:42:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T21:35:08Z","closed_at":"2019-09-07T16:13:08Z","merged_at":"2019-09-07T16:13:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"867cd0f714345574cb4ef4e2d0e913386b256714","assignee":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/68941662b0136b5d5a5cf843c4f34d9efcccdb88","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:show-dag","ref":"show-dag","sha":"68941662b0136b5d5a5cf843c4f34d9efcccdb88","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_i

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-01T12:31:54Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T12:51:35Z","closed_at":"2019-09-05T11:09:21Z","merged_at":"2019-09-05T11:09:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"ebffd39c9969223a6cb0ad76d7306b14d736fae3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/da574eb15b24e7c2e3f9f3d785866be90c6a68c0","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:example-uri","ref":"example-uri","sha":"da574eb15b24e7c2e3f9f3d785866be90c6a68c0","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

is a special case of a BranchOperator, thus it should inherit from it.\r\nThis fixes an issue where the skipping behaviour of LatestOnlyOperator is inconsistent with other operators,\r\nby forcefully skipping all downstream tasks recursively ignoring trigger rules.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2923\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1784 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nLatestOnlyOperator is a special case of a BranchOperator, thus it should inherit from it.\r\nThis fixes an issue where the skipping behaviour of LatestOnlyOperator is inconsistent with other operators by forcefully skipping all downstream tasks recursively, ignoring trigger rules.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nExtended `tests.operators.test_latest_only_operator.py` to cover downstream children with trigger rules. Furthermore fixed the test to not skip task in externally triggered DagRuns.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-31T11:45:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T12:35:46Z","closed_at":"2020-01-27T08:41:00Z","merged_at":"2020-01-27T08:41:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"b568f745a9882a51cb63ca226edfc30021c7c1fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d600f6ee6e3941d58d80473e0b95aa6c0ba7e87f","head":{"label":"m1racoli:feature/AIRFLOW-2923","ref":"feature/AIRFLOW-2923","sha":"d600f6ee6e3941d58d80473e0b95aa6c0ba7e87f","user":{"login":"m1racoli","id":7921017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli","html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115028004,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTUwMjgwMDQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"m1racoli/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"m1racoli","id":7921017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli","html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli/airflow","description":"Apache

PR is targeted to **_v1-10-test_**\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5357\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSame as https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5962:\r\n\r\nCredits to Anurag Jain for reporting this:\r\nIt was observed that the content type is set incorrectly while exporting variables in Apache Airflow.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\nOpen the Apache Airflow\r\nCreate a new variable at /admin/variable/\r\nKeep the key as and value as\r\nSave this variable\r\nExport this variable using Mozilla Firefox Browser\r\nObserve that the downloaded file is saved as .json.htm instead of .json. This happens since Apache airflow sets Response Content-Type as text/html instead of application/json which causes Browser to interpret it as a HTML\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5357\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCredits to Anurag Jain for reporting this:\r\n\r\nIt was observed that the content type is set incorrectly while exporting variables in Apache Airflow. \r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n>>> \r\n>>> 1. Open the Apache Airflow\r\n>>> 2. Create a new variable at /admin/variable/\r\n>>> 3. Keep the key as <input> and value as <input>\r\n>>> 4. Save this variable\r\n>>> 5. Export this variable using Mozilla Firefox Browser\r\n>>> 6. Observe that the downloaded file is saved as <name>.json.htm instead of <name>.json. This happens since Apache airflow sets Response Content-Type as text/html instead of application/json which causes Browser to interpret it as a HTML\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5349\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nKubernetes PODs might be [specified with explicit scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/#specify-schedulers-for-pods). This feature, however, is currently not available from the `KubernetesPodOperator` API.\r\n\r\nI am offering simple PR that adds this option via a `scheduler_name` parameter.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n   - `tests.minikube.test_kubernetes_pod_operator.test_pod_scheduler_name`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5343\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSQLalchemy supports connection check while returning it from the pool. There is a need to allow this parameter (pool_pre_ping) while creating the connection to database.\r\nMore info here: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/pooling.html#disconnect-handling-pessimistic\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt's kinda integration layer with database and not really coverable with unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5362\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nImports in the projects are not ordered properly and there's no unified way to sort them. This causes big headaches resolving conflicts in rebasing/cherry-picking and the lookings of the code base. What're included in the PR:\r\n\r\n1. Add flake8 isort plugin in to check import soring in pre-commit/CI\r\n1. Added isort config in setup.cfg.\r\n1. Sort existing imports following the isort rules.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo code change, just changing imports.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ x ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ x ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`subprocess.stdout.readline` returns `b''`, so `iter(self._sp.stdout.readlin, '')` not work. I fixed it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested with Python 2 and 3 as below codes. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport subprocess\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\n\r\nsp = subprocess.Popen(\r\n    [\"echo\", \"hello\"],\r\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\r\n    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT\r\n)\r\n\r\n# for line in iter(sp.stdout.readline, b''):\r\nfor line in iter(sp.stdout):\r\n    if line == b'':\r\n        sleep(0.1)\r\n    print('line :: ' + str(line))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

optional\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5336\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd ability to make updating perms and other syncs on webserver init optional similar to https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/pull/625\r\nI am running into issues where multiple webserver processes are running what I believe is the sync_perm and it causes there to be records in the ab_permission_view with null permission_id (ultimately resulting in both processes crashing until I either manually clean them up or recreate the table). I envision being able to shut it off on the webserver init and use a one-off run that I am currently using, that handles it as part of deployment via the sync_perm CLI command.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNot sure if testing is needed here. If it is, let me know where to look.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5335\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAfter we refactored to using Storage client in GCS, we need more IAM permissions.\r\n\r\nThis is because we use `get_bucket` method which requires `storage.bucket.list` permission. Instead of that if we use `bucket` method that creates Bucket object we don't need the above permission.\r\n\r\nThis restores the behavior (IAM perms needed) of  **Airflow <=1.10.3** \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests updated\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-28T16:27:23Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T15:40:37Z","closed_at":"2019-08-29T15:40:33Z","merged_at":"2019-08-29T15:40:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1d3d55da969b2cd2c5ad150b5bda0cbe407cf3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

targeted to 1.10.4. Creating new PR for master\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5168\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n2 issues in 1.10.4\r\n\r\n(1) Invalid template field. It was resolved by https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5751\r\n(2) An issue with `add_labels` field expained below:\r\n\r\nThere is a commit to master which adds label support, this has a change in the hook & base operator: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/4d58f36df3b533edfce873799dc161ee34571d63#diff-bc55ad8b749b7a136f51ffabfdbaf13dL684\r\n\r\nThen in the 1.10.4 branch there is a massive commit for GCP DLP: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/222c6ac45de54ed0398645c1d456a592e194325b\r\n\r\nThis seems to have leaked the operator part of the label change only: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/222c6ac45de54ed0398645c1d456a592e194325b#diff-bc55ad8b749b7a136f51ffabfdbaf13dR693\r\n\r\nThis then manifests as this error when trying to execute a Dataproc job: [2019-08-09 14:32:02,971] {taskinstance.py:1047} ERROR - _DataProcJobBuilder instance has no attribute 'add_labels'\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdd tests to cover both issues\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-27T18:39:49Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T12:13:49Z","closed_at":"2019-08-28T12:13:45Z","merged_at":"2019-08-28T12:13:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"73dda73249e4506cba050e508f6bc09994412c8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes
