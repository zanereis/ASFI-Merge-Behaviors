Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, the segment granularity for tables in the catalog had to be defined in period format, ie `'PT1H'` , `'P1D'`, etc. This disallows a user from defining segment granularity of `'ALL'` for a table in the catalog, which may be a valid use case. This change makes it so that a user may define the segment granularity of a table in the catalog, as any string that results in a valid granularity using either the `Granularity.fromString(str)` method, or `new PeriodGranularity(new Period(value), null, null)`, and that granularity maps to a standard supported granularity, where `GranularityType.isStandard(granularity)` returns true. As a result a user may who wants to assign a catalog table's segment granularity to be hourly, may assign the segment granularity property of the table to be either `PT1H`, or `HOUR`. These are the same formats accepted at query time.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nBetter fallback strategy when the broker is unable to materialize the subquery's results as frames for estimating the bytes:\r\na. We don't touch the subquery sequence till we know that we can materialize the result as frames. Otherwise, aggregators holding some resources can get closed and the fallback doesn't work properly. I have added a test case to verify that. \r\nb. Remove the ad-hoc fallback case, which I haven't seen happen. Most of the queries fallback due to insufficient types present at the runtime to generate the query. But if we are unable to materialize the result as bytes due to any unforeseen reason, the current fallback path is incorrect. The other alternative is to rerun the whole subquery, but that will degrade the subquery performance significantly, and we should rather throw an exception in that case so that the user can disable `maxSubqueryBytes`. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

<https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-rollup>, running `./bin/dsql` will throw an error output as `dsql-main` uses Python2 with the `urllib2` library. \r\n\r\n#### Changes to `dsql` Script\r\n- Add checking of python version to use the appropriate scripts.\r\n- Add warning message about future removal of `dsql-main-py2` file as Python2 is eventually going to be removed.\r\n\r\n#### Rename Python2 Script\r\n- Rename the previous `dsql-main` script to `dsql-main-py2` for better clarity.\r\n\r\n#### Updates to Python3 (`dsql-main-py3`)\r\n- Changed `urllib2` import to `urllib.request`, `urllib.error`\r\n- Removed future library\r\n- Changed the encoding logic (`encode('utf-8')` and `decode('utf-8')`) where necessary to allow for correct output. \r\n- Change links to point to Python3.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nDruid tutorials that require the use of `./bin/dsql` script now supports Python3.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\n## Problem \r\nCurrently, datasource schema doesn’t include columns from cold segments. This makes it impossible to query entirely cold datasource. \r\n\r\n## Approach \r\n- Mechanism to backfill schema for cold segments in the metadata database. Note, that this is required only for segments created prior to enabling CentralizedDatasourceSchema feature. \r\n- Update datasource schema building logic on the Coordinator to include schema from cold segments. \r\n- Make Brokers aware of entirely cold datasource. \r\n\r\n## Backfill schema for cold segments\r\n\r\nLeverage the existing schema backfill flow added as part of `CentralizedDatasourceSchema` feature. Users are supposed to manually load the cold segments by making their replication factor as 1 and once the schema is backfilled (can be verified from the metadata database) they can unload the segment. \r\n\r\n## Handling entirely cold datasource \r\n\r\nThe problem with cold datasource is that Broker just doesn’t know about the datasource if none of the segment are available. So, the datasource wouldn’t even appear on the console for querying. \r\nWe need a way for the Brokers to be aware of cold datasource, so that it can fetch its schema from the Coordinator. \r\n\r\nCurrently, brokers request schema for available datasources from Coordinator in each refresh cycle. \r\nBrokers now poll set of used datasources from the Coordinator first and then request their schema from the Coordinator. \r\n\r\nOnce Broker has schema for Cold datasources, it will show up in the console and become available for querying. \r\n\r\n## Key changes \r\n*  `CoordinatorSegmentMetadataCache` \r\n    * It runs a scheduled thread to fetch used segments and build datasource schema from cold segments. Hot and cold schema is merged when datasource schema is queried. \r\n* `BrokerSegmentMetadataCache` \r\n    * The refresh condition is slightly updated, refresh is executed in each cycle if the feature is enabled. \r\n    * The refresh logic is also updated to poll used datasources from the Coordinator. This way Broker can fetch cold datasource schema. \r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n* `CentralizedDatasourceSchema` feature needs to be enabled in order to query entirely cold datasources, also it would enable querying on columns only present in cold segments. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.65.0</h2>\n<p>grpc-netty in this release is compatible with Netty 4.1.111; it fixes the incompatibility that caused data corruption. grpc-netty-shaded is still using Netty 4.1.100.</p>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New module grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Add <code>ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)</code> (960012d76). This is the same as the existing <code>inboundHeaders()</code>, but is provided the Metadata</li>\n<li>api: Fix various typos in the documentation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11144\">#11144</a>) (6ec744f2a)</li>\n<li>core: When queuing RPCs, don’t request picks from the LB twice (8844cf7b8). This could be viewed as a small performance optimization, but mainly reduces the amount of race-handling code</li>\n<li>util: Improve AdvancedTlsX509KeyManager’s documentation, verification, and testing. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11139\">#11139</a>) (781b4c457) This change shows <code>@ExperimentalApi</code> being removed, but it was re-added in 3c97245 before the release</li>\n<li>examples: Fix broken command in reflection readme (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11131\">#11131</a>) (c31dbf48a)</li>\n<li>binder: Add a connection timeout (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11255\">#11255</a>) (791f894e2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Exit idle mode when delayed transport is in use (fea577c80). This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible</li>\n<li>netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11294\">#11294</a>) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption</li>\n<li>okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19). Previously, shutting down when a new connection was being established could result in the server never becoming terminated</li>\n<li>inprocess: Fix listener race if transport is shutdown while starting (e4e7f3a06). This issue was unlikely to be hit outside of specialized tests</li>\n<li>services: restore //services:binarylog bazel target (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11292\">#11292</a>) (d57f271). This fixes a regression introduced in 1.62.2</li>\n<li>binder: Wait for all server transports to terminate before returning the security policy executor to the object pool (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11240\">#11240</a>) (34ee600dc)</li>\n<li>binder: Reject further SETUP_TRANSPORT requests post-BinderServer shutdown (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11260\">#11260</a>) (1670e97f7)</li>\n<li>bazel: Include missing com_google_protobuf_javalite in MODULE.bazel (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11147\">#11147</a>) (f995c121e)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thanks to</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/hakusai22\"><code>@​hakusai22</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/firov\"><code>@​firov</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mateusazis\"><code>@​mateusazis</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Mir3605\"><code>@​Mir3605</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niloc132\"><code>@​niloc132</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.64.1</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>netty:Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (1.64.x backport) by <a href=\"https://github.com/larry-safran\"><code>@​larry-safran</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/11303\">grpc/grpc-java#11303</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.64.0</h2>\n<p><em>Avoid upgrading your application to Netty 4.1.111, as there is a possible corruption.

Description\r\n\r\nDruid now allows upgrades of segments to higher versions with the same load specs. This was introduced as part of concurrent append and replace and may have other uses.\r\n\r\nWhen a load spec is shared by several segments it is important that the deep storage location is killed only after all the metadata references to it are nuked. This is currently being handled only for used segments.\r\n\r\n### Changes \r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that every used and unused segment reference is considered before killing files on deep storage.\r\n\r\n1. Track lineage of segment upgrades by adding a new column: `upgraded_from_segment_id`:\r\n\r\n- Add a new column to druid_segments table in the metadata store: upgraded_from_segment_id, which indicates the root ancestor to which the load spec originally belonged.\r\n\r\n- Modify SegmentTransactionalAppendAction and SegmentTransactionalReplaceAction to populate the upgraded_from_segment_id and add tests.\r\n\r\n2. Modify kill tasks to handle references to load specs: \r\n\r\n- Fire a task action to determine segment upgrade metadata for the batch prior to nuking\r\n- Nuke segments in batch\r\n- Fire task action to fetch all references to self ids, and upgraded ids fetched previously\r\n- Determine segments with unreferenced load specs\r\n- Delete determined subset from deep storage\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThe native scan query was moved from a contrib extension into core in Druid 0.11 in #4751, which introduced a 'legacy' option to maintain backwards compatibility with the extension, which used a non-standard time column name and always included this timestamp in the results.\r\n\r\nI think sufficient time has passed to allow us to remove this parameter to help simplify code a bit.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nThe native scan query 'legacy' mode has been removed, which was introduced in Druid 0.11 to maintain compatibility during an upgrade from older versions of Druid where the scan query was part of a 'contrib' extension.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a

`FireHydrant` is now `PartialSegment`. This name much more clearly describes what this class does, and with all the other fireman terminology removed it didn't even fit a theme anymore.\r\n* `Sink` is now `AppendableSegment`. This name also much more clearly describes what this class does, and is composed of `PartialSegments` per the previous `FireHydrant` rename.\r\n* Additionally, `SinkQuerySegmentWalker` -> `AppendableSegmentQuerySegmentWalker`, and `SinkQueryRunner` -> `AppendableSegmentQueryRunner`\r\n* Remove `Firehose`, `IngestSegmentFirehose` was only used by Hadoop indexing `DruidRecordReader`, moved to internal class of `DruidRecordReader` as `SegmentReader`\r\n* Remove `FirehoseFactory` and remaining implementations, after #16602 they were no longer used\r\n* Moved things from `org.apache.druid.segment.realtime.sink` and `org.apache.druid.segment.realtime.firehose` up to `org.apache.druid.segment.realtime`.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: should we move metric `ingest/sink/count` to `ingest/appendableSegment/count` or something similar? That is kind of disruptive since there is like a continuity of measurement issue which is kind of sad. We could also always double emit it, but also sad in its own way. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n_todo_\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nFixes a flaw in `greatest` and `least` functions non-vectorized expression processing to ignore `null` valued arguments for determining the output type. For example, given an expression like `least(1.0, 1, null)`, the `getOutputType` method correctly chooses `DOUBLE` as the output type, however during non-vectorized processing, we incorrectly consider it, which ends up with the default `STRING` output type, resulting in incorrectly using the `STRING` comparator instead of the double comparator as expected. This can cause odd effects and incorrect results because values like `1.0` and `1` are considered distinct when using the string comparator, while the same when using a numeric comparator.\r\n\r\nThe added tests fail without the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the

the [upgrade](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16513) to Kernel 3.2.0, the Druid Delta connector extension isn't able to read and ingest Delta tables successfully. \r\n\r\nThe Delta Kernel now requires the `delta-storage` dependency, so add this in our connector. However, even after adding the dependency, reading from a Delta table fails with the following error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can not instantiate `LogStore` class: io.delta.storage.HDFSLogStore\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.defaults.internal.DefaultEngineErrors.canNotInstantiateLogStore(DefaultEngineErrors.java:26)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.defaults.internal.logstore.LogStoreProvider.getLogStore(LogStoreProvider.java:88)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.defaults.engine.DefaultFileSystemClient.listFrom(DefaultFileSystemClient.java:76)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.listFrom(SnapshotManager.java:228)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.listFromOrNone(SnapshotManager.java:253)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.listDeltaAndCheckpointFiles(SnapshotManager.java:294)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.getLogSegmentForVersion(SnapshotManager.java:466)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.getLogSegmentFrom(SnapshotManager.java:415)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.getSnapshotAtInit(SnapshotManager.java:352)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.snapshot.SnapshotManager.buildLatestSnapshot(SnapshotManager.java:113)\r\n\tat io.delta.kernel.internal.TableImpl.getLatestSnapshot(TableImpl.java:55)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.delta.input.DeltaInputSource.createSplits(DeltaInputSource.java:210)\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.msq.input.external.ExternalInputSpecSlicer.sliceSplittableInputSource(ExternalInputSpecSlicer.java:119)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease see the upstream issue https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/3299 and fix https://github.com/delta-io/delta/pull/3304. I verified the upstream fix by deploying a custom Kernel jar and reverting this Class loader workaround, so we should be able to remove it once we upgrade the Kernel to a later version.\r\n\r\nBut as the comments in this patch notes, this is only a temporary workaround until we update to the next upstream Kernel library version. The alternative to this patch would be to revert to 3.1.0 where this issue didn't exist. But we lose some new features and performance improvements made in 3.2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this issue wasn't caught in the unit tests present in our Druid extension because the test setup doesn't fully model an actual setup. For example, the `DeltaLakeDruidModule` [configuration](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/extensions-contrib/druid-deltalake-extensions/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/delta/common/DeltaLakeDruidModule.java#L51) is skipped. \r\nI will follow up with a sanity IT to catch such issues in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nWith the `CentralizedDatasourceSchema` feature, Broker polls datasource schema from the Coordinator. \r\n\r\nDatasource schema could be temporarily empty on the Broker in the following scenario, \r\n* Metadata querying is disabled on the Broker. \r\n* New datasource is added. \r\n* Both Broker and Coordinator tries to build the datasource schema. \r\n* Broker builds empty datasource schema, since none of the segments has a schema on the Broker. \r\n* Schema on the Broker is correctly updated after poll from the Coordinator. \r\n\r\nIn the period between Broker building empty datasource schema and polling correct schema from the Coordinator, queries start to fail with `column not found` exception. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to avoid caching any datasource schema which is empty. \r\n\r\nThis PR also updates the datasource readiness check in the Standard ITs to ensure that the datasource schema is non-empty. \r\n

This was followed by the limit stage having no shuffling (as it would always create a single output partition).\r\n\r\nThis logic is correct, as long as we do not require any specific partitioning for the final output, since the limit would be the final MSQ stage(this would be the case for instance, in the case of writing SELECT query results into a query report).\r\n\r\nHowever, for query types which expect partitions of a specific size, this causes a bug. For example, an async query which applies a LIMIT of 1000, with a context parameter `rowsPerPage:100`. This would expect the limit processor to create a 10 segments of size 100 each. However, the limit processor would still create a single segment as an output. This causes issues with certain queries which would expect multiple partitions.\r\n\r\nThis issue is present with all `SELECT` queries except ones which write to the query report. `REPLACE` or `INSERT` queries which have an ALL partitioning are also affected (since we do not allow LIMIT along with other partitions).\r\n\r\nEven worse, we still sometimes expect these partitions, and this causes an exception when the subsequent stage tries to read them.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to correct this by adding a shuffling based on the resultShuffleSpecFactory after a limit processor depending on the query destination. LimitFrameProcessors currently do not update the partition boosting column, so we also add the boost column to the previous stage, if one is required.\r\n\r\n<h2>Behaviour changes</h2>\r\n\r\n**INSERT + LIMIT with PARTITIONED BY ALL**\r\n\r\nBefore: Only the scan stage would have a shuffle spec (mix).

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `org.apache.druid.segment.realtime.firehose.ChatHandlerResource`\r\n * `org.apache.druid.segment.realtime.firehose.ChatHandler`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

patch:\r\n- Adds an MSQ query context parameter `maxNumSegments` that acts as a guard rail on the maximum number of segments that can be generated by an ingestion task per time chunk. A [similar](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/native-batch/#segments-split-hint-spec) parameter exists in the split hint spec supported by the native engine.\r\n- The default value for this context is null  -- i.e., no restriction on the number of segments per time chunk. I considered `Integer.MAX_INT`, but `null` feels more natural.\r\n- If set or overridden by a user, and a time chunk contains more segments than the number specified in the query context, the MSQ ingestion task will fail with a `TooManySegmentsInTimeChunkFault `.\r\n\r\nMost users won't need to set this config, but this will be useful in the following scenarios:\r\n1. Testing/verification that only a specific # of segments gets created per time chunk\r\n2. Implementing any guard rails in the ingestion flow\r\n\r\nI intentionally left the context parameter and the fault undocumented. We can document it once we have a wider use case. Similarly, no release note is required for this patch.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

found out that when an invalid period is specified to the `TIME_FLOOR` function, the `DruidException` thrown by the Calcite planner targets the `ADMIN` persona rather than `USER`. This is easy to reproduce by running: `\"SELECT TIME_FLOOR(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'PT1Y')\"` in the web-console.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the persona by explicitly handling the `IllegalArgumentException` thrown during the Joda Time period instantiation, and make the exception user-facing. Also, the error message is now decorated with more context.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

utilized an existing metadata query to fetch unused segments for a given datasource, interval and version but this appeared to take a long time despite the indexes, and could have potential overlord

Description\r\n\r\nThe query engine is unable to estimate the correct size in bytes of the subquery results when the scan query has columns which are missing from the segments. This is because the ScanQueryEngine receives all the columns of the scan query, and populates the row signature with null type if its unable to find the column in the segment. \r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the materializing logic to materialize the results of the columns whose types are known, and check that the columns whose types are unknown always have `null` values. This is helpful because:\r\na. If the type is unknown and the column contains all null values, we don't need to materialize the results\r\nb. If the type is unknown and the column contains non-null values in any row, we are running into the case of missing types, and we should throw an error. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixes a bug causing maxSubqueryBytes to not work when segments have missing columns. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

was added in [PR #14322](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14322). When running this test from the IDE (outside of Maven), `testError()` reliably fails. However, it passes in CI due to the Maven setting `<surefire.rerunFailingTestsCount>3</surefire.rerunFailingTestsCount>` in the [pom.xml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/pom.xml#L141). This setting allows Maven to retry the test up to three times, and the test ultimately passes because of the retry logic in the code, but maven treats it as \"flaky\".\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nLooking into the error handling in `BrokerClient`, it was found that the retry logic doesn't effectively handle 5xx `DruidException` categories since the HTTP error codes are converted into `DruidException`s. So the retry logic didn't fully account transient errors and this patch fixes that. We could perhaps change the semantics of the method to just use the HTTP response, or write a service client that uses the built-in mechanisms, but it'll be a larger change.\r\n\r\nAlso, I removed the code that converts all non-200 error codes into retryable 5xx DruidException categories. For example, 4xx error codes shouldn't be retried. If there are additional 500 error codes we need to retry, we can add them explicitly similar to the ones that are currently handled.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added

Release note\r\n\r\n5 new metrics have been added to provide better visibility into the behavior of the thread pool used for uploading parts (of a multi-part upload) to S3 when durable storage is enabled.\r\n1. `s3/upload/part/queuedTime`: Milliseconds spent by a task in queue before it starts uploading a part (of a multi-part upload) to S3 when durable storage is enabled.\r\n2. `s3/upload/part/queueSize`: The number of tasks that are currently queued and waiting to upload a part (of a multi-part upload) to S3 when durable storage is enabled.\r\n3. `s3/upload/part/time`: Milliseconds taken by a task to upload a part (of a multi-part upload) to S3 when durable storage is enabled.\r\n4. `s3/upload/total/time`: The total time taken in milliseconds for uploading all parts of a file to S3 when durable storage is enabled.\r\n5. `s3/upload/total/bytes`: The total number of bytes uploaded across all parts of a file to S3 when durable storage is enabled.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

This is causing a mismatch while creating a column accessor. \r\n\r\nThis commit aims to correct those violating sql aggregators. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\nA streaming ingestion with multiple replicas may sometimes run into the following error\r\nwhen publishing segments to an interval. This can happen only when there is a concurrent\r\nREPLACE task has recently committed higher version segments to that same interval.\r\n\r\n```java\r\njava.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE:\r\nFailed to publish segments because of \r\n[java.lang.RuntimeException: Inconsistency between stored metadata state[KafkaDataSourceMetadata{xxx}]\r\nand target state[KafkaDataSourceMetadata{yyy}]. Try resetting the supervisor.]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error __does not cause any data loss__ but is an operational overhead since it leads to unnecessary task failures.\r\n\r\nThe situation typically plays out as below:\r\n- Streaming supervisor launches 2 replicas to append to an interval `I`\r\n- Both replicas allocate and start appending to a segment `S(v0,p1)`, i.e. segment partition 1 on version 0.\r\n- Concurrent REPLACE task commits a new version `v1` in interval I, say segments `S(v1, p0)`, `S(v1, p1)`\r\n- Version `v0` is now completely overshadowed by version `v1`\r\n- First replica publishes segment `S(v0, p1)`, which is upgraded by the overlord to `S(v1, p2)`\r\n- Second replica tries to publish segment `S(v0, p1)` but fails because higher offsets have already been committed\r\n- Second replica then checks if its segments have already been published by someone else\r\n- In the absence of concurrent replace, the previous step would succeed thus causing second replica to move ahead with the ingestion.\r\n- But since concurrent replace has already overshadowed version `v0`, the second replica is not able to find it in the set of \"used and visible\" segments and thus it fails.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nWhile looking for published segments, the second replica should search not only visible, but also overshadowed and unused segments.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add new task action `RetrieveSegmentsByIdAction`\r\n- Use new task action to retrieve segments irrespective of their visibility\r\n- During rolling upgrades, this task action would fail as Overlord would be on old version\r\n- If new action fails, fall back to just fetching used segments as before\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n__Setup__\r\n- Local Druid cluster with 3 MMs, 3 task slots each\r\n- Kafka streaming ingestion with 3 task replicas\r\n- Concurrent compaction enabled with `skipOffsetFromLatest = PT0S`\r\n\r\n__Observation__\r\nAll the replicas finish successfully even if they are not able to publish segments due to a concurrent replace task.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1263\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-21 at 4 06 35 PM\"

timestamp field to SegmentMetadataEvent\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEvery other metrics emitted by Druid has a timestamp field. The fact that the SegmentMetadataEvent metric does not have a timestamp field can cause problem for the metric system like Druid. If you are ingesting Druid's emitted to Druid, then timestamp is very important. If you are running Druid version earlier than 27 (which doesn't have https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14413), then ingestion will fail if there is no timestamp. While if you are running Druid version later than 27, you may be dropping these no timestamp metrics. (Note that the above is assuming you do not have missingValue set for your Druid's supervisor that is ingesting Druid emitted metrics).\r\nAnyway, let's just add a timestamp so that all metrics are consistent. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

task context fails with non string property value\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a regression caused by https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14239\r\nThe above PR introduces a new method `addSystemProperty` with String type in the method definition for the property value. (Previously, we were using `StringUtils.format` which takes in Object as argument). The problem is that `task.getContextValue(propName)` has a return type which is a generic type parameter ContextValueType. This means the method can return a value of any type specified at the time of invocation. When the value of the context property is not a String, Java is still trying to call the `addSystemProperty` with String type causing the task to fail. \r\ni.e. if we have something like\r\n```\r\n  \"context\": {\r\n    \"druid.indexer.fork.property.druid.processing.numThreads\": 4\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nwe'll get the error: \r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner$1.call(ForkingTaskRunner.java:319) [druid-indexing-service-31.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:31.0.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat org.apache.druid.indexing.overlord.ForkingTaskRunner$1.call(ForkingTaskRunner.java:171) [druid-indexing-service-31.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:31.0.0-SNAPSHOT]\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.TrustedListenableFutureTask$TrustedFutureInterruptibleTask.runInterruptibly(TrustedListenableFutureTask.java:131) [guava-32.0.1-jre.jar:?]\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.InterruptibleTask.run(InterruptibleTask.java:75) [guava-32.0.1-jre.jar:?]\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.TrustedListenableFutureTask.run(TrustedListenableFutureTask.java:82) [guava-32.0.1-jre.jar:?]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149) [?:1.8.0_322]\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624) [?:1.8.0_322]\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:750) [?:1.8.0_322]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the issue by casting the return value from `task.getContextValue(propName)` to Object and then use `addSystemProperty` with Object type for the value parameter.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

user to override/specify python exec to use for build\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBuilding Druid requires Python to execute some python script like generate-binary-notice.py and generate-binary-license.py. These scripts may require packages to be installed (i.e. pyyaml). Some build environments may have python3 available but prevent job (running on that worker) to install packages to the machine python. These environments requires Python venv to be setup. This PR allows such Python venv to be specify and use in the build process.\r\n\r\ni.e. An example build step\r\n```\r\npython -m venv .venv\r\n.venv/bin/pip install pyyaml\r\nmvn clean install package -Dpython.exec=.venv/bin/python -Pbundle-contrib-exts -Pdist....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, broadcast segments are assigned to data servers by the coordinator. This usual route alone can cause data correctness issues because if a process (either a task or server) is using broadcast segments for ingestion or to serve queries, the ingestion or query results can be invalid due to the asynchronous nature of segment assignment and loading.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on top of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16475.\r\n\r\nTo address this data correctness problem, a process when it starts up _attempts_ to fetch and load any broadcast (bootstrap) segments from the coordinator first before it can proceed. If there are any errors in this bootstrapping process talking to the coordinator, the process just comes up in a \"fail open\" state and doesn't block start up.  \r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Add a new API `/v1/metadata/bootstrapSegments` in the coordinator that returns bootstrap segments. Currently, the set of bootstrap segments only contains broadcast segments.  In the future, we can expand on this mechanism to speed up historical upgrades as well. \r\n- When a process starts up, it reaches out to the coordinator (if it can find one) to fetch the bootstrap segments. This is done in `SegmentLoadDropHandler`. The handler then loads any previously cached segments along with the bootstrap segments onto its storage location.\r\n\r\n\r\nMisc changes:\r\n- Remove `@JacksonInject PruneSpecsHolder` argument in the `LoadableDataSegment` constructor. It always defaults to `PruneSpecsHolder.DEFAULT` and doesn't depend on the injected value\r\n- Remove an unused test in `LocalDataSegmentPuller` \r\n- Fix a typo and remove white spaces in `DruidException`\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Add an optional fail close strategy for tasks via a task runtime config.  By default, tasks will still fail open as implemented in this patch. Servers will only have the option to fail open.\r\n2. Optimize the loading of bootstrap segments for tasks. For example, compaction and kill tasks can skip loading any bootstrap segments, while MSQ ingest and query tasks can selectively load the ones specified in the SQL. Real-time tasks, similar to servers, should always load all bootstrap segments.\r\n3. Add more metrics in the existing bootstrapping flow for visibility. For example, count of cached segments loaded, how many have failed to load, total bootstrap load time, etc. Document all these metrics under a separate category in the user-facing docs.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nAdded a coordinator API `POST /v1/metadata/bootstrapSegments` that returns the set of bootstrap segments. Currently, the set only contains broadcast segments. When a process (either a server or task) comes up, it _attempts_ to query the coordinator to fetch all bootstrap segments and loads them before the process can proceed doing its thing. This primarily addresses a data correctness issue where a process doesn't have broadcast segments assigned yet and starts processing data.  In the event of any errors, the process just comes up in a fail open state and doesn't block start up. \r\n\r\nTo this effect, new metrics have been added in the bootstrap segments flow:\r\n\r\n1. `segment/bootstrap/time`: Total time taken to fetch bootstrap segments from the coordinator\r\n2. `segment/bootstrap/count`: Total count of bootstrap segments fetched from the coordinator\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

I setup a simple http server using Python’s utility: `python -m http.server 9333` - I had wikipedia.json.gz in the same directory for the server to serve.\r\n2. I triggered an MSQ ingestion using HTTP source as `http://localhost:9333/wikipedia.json.gz`\r\n3. I exited the Python process immediately after starting the ingestion.\r\n4. I verified that the task was failing at this point prior to this PR's changes. But with this PR's changes, retry mechanism kicks in.\r\n5. I re-ran the Python server in the middle of the ongoing retries.\r\n6. Validated that the next retry iteration was able to continue and take the task to successful completion.\r\n7. Verified that the number of rows ingested was correct. Also tried querying the data, works fine.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `RetryingGZIPInputStream`: Class to facilitate retries over a GZIPInputStream.\r\n * `RetryingInputStreamUtils`: A utils class to extract common functionality between `RetryingGZIPInputStream` and `RetryingInputStream`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

introduced a bug in the flow of batch segment allocation where pending segments are allocated exactly once but are not deduplicated before commit. This leads to a log like:\r\n```\r\nDuplicate entry <pendingSegmentId> for key 'PRIMARY'\r\n```\r\nThe pending segments are not duplicated and this log is transient.

`AbstractStringRowBasedKeySerdeHelper` to use the pre-computed dictionary ID ranking only when we have a pre-computed dictionary (i.e. enableRuntimeDictionaryGeneration is false). Using the pre-computed ranking when it is not applicable in the `SpillingGrouper` seems like the cause for this. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

This would remove multiple methods and makes it easy to maintain. \r\n\r\nAlongside, this commit adds the support for using same bound kinds in the window query\r\nexample : `x preceding and y preceding`\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nThis PR changes `EqualityFilter` and `TypedInfilter` numeric match values against string columns to now cast the strings to numbers instead of converting the numeric values directly to string for pure string equality.  This  makes using these filters (the default in SQL compatible mode) behave consistently with 'default' value mode which uses the `BoundFilter` for numeric comparison of string values.\r\n\r\nThe added tests to cover numeric equality matching. Double match values in particular would fail to match the string values since `1.0` would become `'1.0'` which does not match `'1'`. \r\n\r\nI investigated an alternative of just having the SQL planner not eat `CAST` operators like it currently does, since a query like `... WHERE stringColumn = 1.0` ends up as `... WHERE CAST(stringColumn as DOUBLE) = 1.0` before we eat the cast, which makes the native layer a lot more explicit, however this change basically does the same thing and is a lot less disruptive.\r\n\r\nIt may still be worth investigating not eating casts during SQL planning, but I'll save that for follow-up work.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nModified behavior of using `EqualityFilter` and `TypedInFilter` to match numeric typed values (particularly DOUBLE) against string columns to effectively cast the strings to use numerical comparison, for more consistent Druid behavior between `sqlUseBoundAndSelectors` context flag. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new query context parameter `removeNullBytes` which the users can set to remove null bytes while writing the string and string array data to frames. To remove null bytes, the users wrap the string columns in a `REPLACE` function. The query planner can sometimes optimize and add the function in the later stages, especially when subqueries are involved. This can cause the query to fail when run with the MSQ engine, which cannot work with null bytes in string fields. Adding the context parameter ensures that the null bytes are removed from the first stage itself when the data is read. \r\n\r\n### Upgrade-Downgrade considerations\r\n\r\nThe mismatch of the controller-worker versions shouldn't cause any backward incompatibilities. If a worker on an older version encounters this flag, they will ignore it and throw an error on encountering \\0. Likewise, if the controller is on an older version, it won't pass this flag to the workers, and they will throw on encountering \\0 (default behavior). Therefore, in the presence of older versions, we would behave in the default way and throw an exception, which is the original behavior of the code (without this change). \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nMSQ cannot process null bytes in string fields, and the current workaround is to remove them using the REPLACE function. 'removeNullBytes' context parameter has been added which sanitizes the input string fields by removing these null bytes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThe current default `batchAllocationWaitTime` is 500ms. This means that the `SegmentAllocationQueue`\r\nwaits for 500ms before a batch is processed to allow it to accumulate more requests.\r\nIn some cases, particularly MSQ tasks, this adds an unnecessary penalty to the task duration.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nWith batch segment allocation enabled and `batchAllocationWaitTime=0`,\r\nthe segment allocation queue becomes more adaptive and exhibits the following behaviour:\r\n- Process the first segment allocation request added to the queue immediately.\r\n- While the first request is being processed, let any subsequent requests accumulate in the queue.\r\n- Once the first request is processed, pick up the next batch in the queue for processing.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nWe have had `batchAllocationWaitTime=0` in several of our production clusters for a couple of months now.\r\nIt has particularly helped with MSQ tasks, which don't really benefit from batching as segments are allocated serially.\r\nWaiting 500ms for every allocation increased MSQ task durations leading to unnecessary compute costs.\r\n\r\n### Release Note\r\n\r\nUpdate default value of `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchAllocationWaitTime` to `0`.\r\nThus, a segment allocation request is processed immediately unless there are already some requests queued before this one. While in queue, a segment allocation request may get clubbed together with other similar requests into a batch to reduce load on the metadata store.","created_at":"2024-06-10T03:29:46Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:41:21Z","closed_at":"2024-06-10T14:37:23Z","merged_at":"2024-06-10T14:37:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4fdf1055b4cdbb5ea9d16fdd4130643caa3d9e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cryptoe","id":2260045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2260045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe","html_url":"https://github.com/cryptoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nFixes an issue that occurs after #16366 where expressions with single input dictionary encoded columns that are not strings but have a string output incorrectly use the string dictionary encoded vector selector.\r\n\r\nThe fix for now is to make setting the capabilities of the virtual column to be dictionary encoded only if the input type is string. In the future if we make dictionary encoded selectors that are not coupled with handling strings then we could remove this constraint, but until then, this is the safest option to avoid incorrectly using string dimension selectors.\r\n\r\nWhile here also noticed that `COMPLEX<json>` was needlessly reporting itself as dictionary encoded, which isn't quite true. While the nested field columns are dictionary encoded, the json values themselves are not, so functions like `TO_JSON_STRING` could also run into this problem.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR fixes a few bugs with MSQ export. The main change is calling SqlResults#coerce before writing the column. This allows sketches and json to be correctly deserialized. The format of the exported complex columns are similar to those produced by Async MSQ queries with CSV format.\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes</h4>\r\n\r\n- Fix printing of complex columns during export. Sketches and JSON are now correctly formatted during export.\r\n- Fix an NPE if the writer has not been initialized. Empty export queries will create an empty file at the location.\r\n- Fix a bug with counters for MSQ export, where rows were reported for only the first partition.  \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h4>Backward compatibility</h4>\r\n\r\nThe changes made are not backward compatible, as this would might create inconsistency between older and newer versions. This might cause some export query to fail during upgrade.\r\n\r\n<h4>Patch Notes</h4>\r\n- Export queries might fail during upgrade.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
