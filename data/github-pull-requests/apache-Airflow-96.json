Tasks are processed in a distributed fashion across the machines running the Schedulers. It takes into consideration the scenario when a scheduler is restarted. It also explains the limitations on sharing of instances across tasks with multiple Schedulers. This information was not clear in the existing documentation, and this update should help users understand how LocalExecutor works in a multi-Scheduler setup.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/26565\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/26565\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

commit sanitizes the DagRun.run_id parameter by introducing a configurable option. Users now have the ability to select a specific run_id pattern for their runs, ensuring stricter control over the values used. This update does not impact the default run_id generation performed by the scheduler for scheduled DAG runs or for Dag runs triggered without modifying the run_id parameter in the run configuration page. The configuration flexibility empowers users to align the run_id pattern with their specific

Users cannot list any items in the Airflow DAG Run UI when this happens. The workaround to allow customers to list DAG Runs again was manually remove from the SQL database the DAG Run rows with unparsable `config`.\r\n\r\nAn example of an error message:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 2447, in wsgi_app\r\nresponse = self.full_dispatch_request()\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1952, in full_dispatch_request\r\nrv = self.handle_user_exception(e)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1821, in handle_user_exception\r\nreraise(exc_type, exc_value, tb)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/_compat.py\", line 39, in reraise\r\nraise value\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1950, in full_dispatch_request\r\nrv = self.dispatch_request()\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1936, in dispatch_request\r\nreturn self.view_functions[rule.endpoint](**req.view_args)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/www/auth.py\", line 51, in decorated\r\nreturn func(*args, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/www/decorators.py\", line 109, in view_func\r\nreturn f(*args, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/www/decorators.py\", line 72, in wrapper\r\nreturn f(*args, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/utils/session.py\", line 70, in wrapper\r\nreturn func(*args, session=session, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/www/views.py\", line 2291, in tree\r\nsession.query(DagRun)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 3373, in all\r\nreturn list(self)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 100, in instances\r\ncursor.close()\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/util/langhelpers.py\", line 68, in exit\r\ncompat.raise_(\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/util/compat.py\", line 182, in raise_\r\nraise exception\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 80, in instances\r\nrows = [proc(row) for row in fetch]\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 80, in <listcomp>\r\nrows = [proc(row) for row in fetch]\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 579, in _instance\r\n_populate_full(\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 725, in _populate_full\r\ndict_[key] = getter(row)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sqlalchemy/sql/sqltypes.py\", line 1723, in process\r\nreturn loads(value)\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'unusual_prefix_000a97efabd6e981b062d199b3a7ce82d192aeca_scenario-flow'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change does not deal with the root cause problem (the fact that the Scheduler is creating DAG Runs with `config`, which cannot be parsed by the Webserver).

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\nThis PR provides support for creating unique but sensible names to k8s pods based on the given name and `ti.job_id`. The KubernetesPodOperator supports adding random suffix but that isn't suitable for our use case. The random suffix can't be templated and isn't available via DAG context.\r\n\r\nThe background for this is the need to run Spark tasks in k8s. In order to use the preferred `client` mode, the pod name needs to be placed in spark configuration so that driver-executor communication can take place via a headless k8s service. This requires that the name of the (driver) pod is unique and known at the time the pod is created. The `ti.job_id` seems to be a good way to make pod names unique and is available via pod context when pod is created.\r\n\r\nThe change adds a new argument `job_id_as_suffix` to the `KubernetesPodOperator` class with backwards compatibility with `random_suffix`. In case `job_id_as_suffix=True` and `random_name_suffix=False`, the `ti.job_id` value from context will be appended to the pod name, separated by `-`. The same value can then be provided to spark configuration via Airflow templating to use as the driver hostname for the headless service.","created_at":"2023-06-30T08:19:54Z","updated_at":"2023-07-17T10:09:56Z","closed_at":"2023-07-17T10:09:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97fbd0706dabce05fe178b8121086f4a4d1574e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes

has been a lot of triggers added recently, and they all reuse more or less the same code, with some variations.\r\nThis leads to many (small) inconsistencies in trigger code, and also in a lot of duplicated code.\r\n\r\nWe can package all this in a single base class and reuse it as much as possible, which is what I'm doing here.\r\n\r\nAdapting all triggers to this base class is also a good way to resolve some of the inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS:\r\n\r\n1. I'd advise starting by looking at the newly added file `base_trigger.py`\r\n2. Then, look at how the other triggers were changed to use that new base trigger\r\n3. Then, look at the small changes in the operators/sensors\r\n4. Then, look at the tests.\r\n\r\ncc @syedahsn @ferruzzi @vincbeck

Consequently, these strings are incorrectly regarded as resolved, even though they are not instances from `MappedArgument` or `XComArg`, and their values still match those provided by the

change is based on a number of discussions with the users asking what are the minimum requirements for Airflow to run.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot give precise answer, we should also make the users aware that simple answers are not possible, and that when they are deciding to install airflow and manage it on their own, they also take the responsibility to monitor and adjust the resources they need based on the monitoring they have to run.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#15330 added docker.task, it also optimized replacement of the callable with it's result in LazyDictWithCache. LazyDictWithCache is used by Provider's Manager to optimize access to hooks - basically hook is only actually imported, when it is accessed. This helps with speeding up importing of connection information\r\n\r\nThe optimization added result of running callable to _resolved set, but it missed the case when None was returned. Previously, when None was returned, the callable was not replaced and it was called again. After the change - the _resolved set was updated with the key and None was returned. But since the key has not been replaced, next time when the same key was retrieved, the original \"callable\" was returned, not the None value. So if callable returned None, and the same key was retrieved twice, the second time, instead of None, the dictionary returned Callable.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by setting the value to dictionary even if it was None.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

submitting the BigQuery to GCS job or GCS to BigQuery job, the current code only prefers the project_id of the BigQuery table, and ignores the provided project_id argument to the `BigQueryToGCSOperator` and `GCSToBigQueryOperator` operators (as pointed out by @bhagany in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32106). This is not the expected behaviour, and the provided project_id must be used to submit the job to BigQuery and use that project's resources for computation.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to correct this behaviour by making hook's project_id as the fallback project for both BigQuery storage and compute.\r\n* Storage : Prefer project_id in table name. If not provided, fallback to hook's project_id.\r\n* Compute : Prefer project_id param of operator. If not provided, fallback to hook's project_id.\r\n\r\nNote: This change replaces @Yaro1 's previous change in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30053, where the BQ table's project_id is used for computation.\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32106\r\n\r\nsuppress: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32144\r\nsuppress:

executor_class in job was used in the past to pass information about executor being used but it has been replaced by executor passed via JobRunner when needed. The executor_class has only been used in backfill job, but it has been used wrongly - because it had no fully qualified path there.\r\n\r\nThe right way of using it is to check the executor passed via JobRunner, and since executor_class is not used any more, we can safely remove it\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug when custom executors could not be used\r\nduring backfill.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

are quite a few recurring themes when it comes to using git-sync for DAG synchronisation and this documentation is an attempt to capture results of a number of discussions and conversations. It adds some notes that might make it possible to make more informed decisions by our users and Deployment managers who want to make decisions on how they should synchronize their DAGs.\r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n\r\n* notes on potential side-effects one has to be aware when using both git-sync and persistence together (there are some unobvious operations performed by git-sync that might affect performance of persistence solutions)\r\n\r\n* notes on how you can use multiple git repositories with git-sync using submodule approach - including link to a real-life use case from Airflow summit where it has been used in production for 100s of repositories.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of

The KubernetesPodOperator supports adding random suffix but that isn't suitable for our use case, where the pod name needs to be provided to Spark executor that are launched by the k8s pod. The random suffix can't be templated and isn't available via DAG context.\r\n\r\nThe background for this is need to run Spark tasks in k8s. In order to allow using the preferred `client` mode, the pod name needs to be given to spark so that driver-executor communication can take place via a headless k8s service. This requires that the name of the (driver) pod is unique and known at the time the pod is created. The `task_instance.job_id` seems to be a good way to make pod names unique and is available via pod context when pod is created.\r\n\r\nThe change adds a new argument `job_id_as_suffix` to the `KubernetesPodOperator` class with a backwards compatible default to `random_suffix`. In case `job_id_as_suffix=True` and `random_name_suffix=False`, the `ti.job_id` value will be appended to the pod name, separated by `-`. The same value can then be provided to spark configuration to use as the driver hostname for the headless service. The additional pod configurations can use the normal Airflow templating system.\r\n\r\nWe considered using the  Spark k8s operator in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator but that only supports cluster mode and has not been updated for a while. We have experience in running Spark on k8s with client mode and have found it very useful. This PR will allow using Spark client mode on k8s more easily.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

basic docs for setup / teardown tasks.\r\n\r\n~One bit of uncertainty is whether, by the time this is released, we'll still require setups have a teardown and vice versa.  I.e. if you want to have a setup with no teardown, you have to add an empty teardown, e.g. with the empty operator.   Alternatively we could just say that if a setup has no teardown, all its downstreams are assumed to require it a.k.a. assumed to be within scope.  I think either way is pretty much fine, but for now we require empty teardown.~\r\nOk, raised \"empty teardown\" question, on the list, so for now we simply move forward with requiring empty teardown.  Conveniently, it's a constraint we could remove without breaking backcompat.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-27T03:39:08Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T18:33:55Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T20:12:18Z","merged_at":"2023-07-20T20:12:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d70fecfaf68dbc34c818290ad35f48bf01044dd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

\"advanced logging configuration\" applies not only to task logs but also to component logs and you can use it not only to configure custom way how task logs are created but also custom way how \"regular\" component logs are created.\r\n\r\nThis has been a source of confusion for those who wanted to configure (for example) elasticsearch or opensearch for the whole airflow deployment, because the \"advanced configuration\" and how to modify standard configuration chapter was a small section in \"task logging\".\r\n\r\nThis change extracts \"advanced logging configuration\" to separate page right under the \"logging and monitoring\" and directs the user from the \"task\" logging section to this page. It also adds a bit more explanation on how standard Python logging framework is leveraged here and links to Python logging documentation for those who never used it before, to understand more about Loggers, Handlers and Formatters.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
