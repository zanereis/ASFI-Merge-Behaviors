What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new trait `QueryErrorsBase` which is supposed to be used by `Query.*Errors`, and new method `toSQLValue()`. The method converts a parameter value of error classes to its SQL representation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. Users should see values in error messages in unified SQL style.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove value type check before is_list_like check.\r\n\r\nThis is one of fixes to make pandas on spark work with pandas 1.4+.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince Pandas v1.4.0, pandas are using [`not (hasattr(obj, \"ndim\") and obj.ndim == 0)`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/d228a781b4d7be6c753cee940ce3ee692e97697d/pandas/_libs/lib.pyx#L1114) to exclude zero-dimensional duck-arrays, effectively scalars: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commit/d228a781b4d7be6c753cee940ce3ee692e97697d\r\n\r\nBut for a `Column` instance, it has some problems, df doesn't allow apply `not` and raise a execption `ValueError: Cannot convert column into bool: please use '&' for 'and', '|' for 'or', '~' for 'not' when building DataFrame boolean expressions.`\r\n\r\nSo we need to move the value type check before is_list_like check.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT passed.\r\n```\r\nOpsOnDiffFramesEnabledTest.test_frame_iloc_setitem\r\nOpsOnDiffFramesEnabledTest.test_series_iloc_setitem\r\nIndexingTest.test_series_iloc_setitem

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36094.\r\nI added `Utils.isTesting` whenever we perform schema conversion or row conversion for TimestampNTZType.\r\n\r\nI verified that the tests, e.g. ParquetIOSuite, fail with unsupported data type when running in non-testing mode:\r\n```\r\n[info]   Cause: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 1 in stage 40.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 1.0 in stage 40.0 (TID 66) (ip-10-110-16-208.us-west-2.compute.internal executor driver):

disable TimestampNTZType as other parts of the codebase do not yet support this type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, the TimestampNTZ type is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested the changes manually by rerunning the test suites that verify TimestampNTZType in the non-testing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a minor followup to only test when Snappy native library is available in low Hadoop versions.\r\nFrom Hadoop 3.3.1 with `HADOOP-17125`, the tests should pass but it fails in lower versions of Hadoop when Snappy native library is unavailable (see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35784#issuecomment-1081290978).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the tests robust.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNope, this is test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nShould monitor

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are many codes in spark that convert `KVStoreView` into scala `List`, and these codes will not close `KVStoreIterator`, these resources are mainly recycled by `finalize()` method implemented in `LevelDB` and `RockSB`, this makes `KVStoreIterator` resource recycling unpredictable. \r\n\r\nThis pr introduce a `viewToSeq` function for `KVUtils`, this function will convert all data in the `KVStoreView` into scala `List` and close `KVStoreIterator` in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd a general function to convert `KVStoreView` into scala `List` and close `KVStoreIterator` in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome testing CASE WHEN queries are not carefully written and do not make sense.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnable `spark.sql.parquet.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` on master branch so it can be covered by more tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBy default `spark.sql.parquet.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` is turned off at the moment, which means many Parquet related tests for complex types will still go through the old row-based Parquet reader from `parquet-mr` library. This is not ideal since we want to prefer the new vectorized Parquet reader in the long term and make sure it is thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, `spark.sql.parquet.enableNestedColumnVectorizedReader` is turned on by default now, but only in master branch.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-04-09T00:06:25Z","updated_at":"2022-04-09T04:29:34Z","closed_at":"2022-04-09T04:29:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"805d2f9643c0ef263897b1f9b7a88251e882a62f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a37a712f090917a5879cf2cf2f1aa777a07f4e68","head":{"label":"sunchao:enable","ref":"enable","sha":"a37a712f090917a5879cf2cf2f1aa777a07f4e68","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN commands with DEFAULT values.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(i BOOLEAN, s STRING) USING PARQUET;\r\nALTER TABLE t ALTER COLUMN s SET DEFAULT CONCAT('abc', 'def');\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES(TRUE, DEFAULT);\r\nSELECT s FROM t WHERE i = TRUE;\r\n> \"abcdef\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis reduces work for users to write INSERT INTO commands into tables by allowing them to leave out some of the column values in reasonable ways.\r\n\r\nIt also helps table owners add columns with values to auto-generate useful information into the table contents, such as date or time values.\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it allows ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN commands to specify optional DEFAULT values for the columns. These default values are stored inside the column metadata.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test coverage was added as part of this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-08T18:42:32Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T15:45:50Z","closed_at":"2022-05-06T15:45:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2004ddf221d994693b465d619850b7086d19e8b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b22d58bc497049914e5525636bff0ea910a2e3c5","head":{"label":"dtenedor:alter-table-alter-column","ref":"alter-table-alter-column","sha":"b22d58bc497049914e5525636bff0ea910a2e3c5","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"834841ef5dab150f249d4171fddb474251beecac","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMethods `wrap_cogrouped_map_pandas_udf` and `wrap_grouped_map_pandas_udf` in `python/pyspark/worker.py` do not need to reject `pd.DataFrame`s with no columns return by udf when that DataFrame is empty (zero rows). This allows to return empty DataFrames without the need to define columns. The DataFrame is empty after all!\r\n\r\n**The proposed behaviour is consistent with the current behaviour of `DataFrame.mapInPandas`.**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReturning an empty DataFrame from the lambda given to `applyInPandas` should be as easy as this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nreturn pd.DataFrame([])\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, PySpark requires that empty DataFrame to have the right _number_ of columns. This seems redundant as the schema is already defined in the `applyInPandas` call. Returning a non-empty DataFrame does not require defining columns.\r\n\r\nBehaviour of `applyInPandas` should be consistent with `mapInPandas`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example to reproduce:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd  \r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, ceil\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    [(1, 1.0), (1, 2.0), (2, 3.0), (2, 5.0), (2, 10.0)],\r\n    (\"id\", \"v\"))  \r\n\r\ndef mean_func(key, pdf):\r\n    if key == (1,):\r\n        return pd.DataFrame([])\r\n    else:\r\n        return pd.DataFrame([key + (pdf.v.mean(),)])\r\n\r\ndf.groupby(\"id\").applyInPandas(mean_func, schema=\"id long, v double\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt changes the behaviour of the following calls to allow returning empty `pd.DataFrame` without defining columns. The PySpark DataFrame returned by `applyInPandas` is unchanged:\r\n\r\n- `df.groupby(…).applyInPandas(…)`\r\n- `df.cogroup(…).applyInPandas(…)`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests are added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to warn when `NettyBlockRpcServer` received a corrupted block RPC message or under attack.\r\n\r\n- `IllegalArgumentException`: When the type is unknown/invalid when decoding. This fails at Spark layer.\r\n- `NegativeArraySizeException`: When the size read is negative. This fails at Spark layer during buffer creation.\r\n- `IndexOutOfBoundsException`: When the data field isn't matched with the size. This fails at Netty later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen the RPC messages are corrupted or the servers are under attack, Spark shows `IndexOutOfBoundsException` due to the failure from `Decoder`. Instead of `Exception`, we had better ignore the message with a directional warning message.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException:\r\n    readerIndex(5) + length(602416) exceeds

clarify the log messages from exceptions, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to document the supported pandas version for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36095 is corresponding PR for master branch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince the behavior of pandas is different per its version, it would be better explicitly documenting the supported pandas version so that users won't confuse.\r\n\r\npandas API on Spark aims matching behavior to pandas 1.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now the supported pandas version is mentioned to the PySpark API reference page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis existing doc build should cover\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-08T06:16:59Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:42:43Z","closed_at":"2022-04-11T01:19:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cbb3925a734c573f0aa81c99a7061d0b02a9b7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/10e39aafefa63d2e1a621ff909d6294a1c5f4fee","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-38800-3.3","ref":"SPARK-38800-3.3","sha":"10e39aafefa63d2e1a621ff909d6294a1c5f4fee","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.nullValueWrittenAsQuotedEmptyStringCsv` for the breaking change introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34853 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34905 (followup).\r\n\r\nThe flag is disabled by default, so the null values written as csv will output an unquoted empty string. When the legacy flag is enabled, the null will output quoted empty string.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe original commit is a breaking change, and breaking changes should be encouraged to add a flag to turn it off for smooth migration between versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWith the default value of the conf, there is no user-facing difference.\r\nIf users turn this conf off, they can restore the pre-change behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThrough unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-07T23:29:57Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T21:44:14Z","closed_at":"2022-04-15T08:45:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5f2f34bae4bf2abcb0a81be3e0b813e3c8c894e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21dc0ed8aba294ca69090c2fdd6255b40bd12cb0","head":{"label":"anchovYu:flags-null-to-csv","ref":"flags-null-to-csv","sha":"21dc0ed8aba294ca69090c2fdd6255b40bd12cb0","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement `skipna` parameter of `DataFrame.all`.\r\n\r\nIf `skipna` is False, numpy.NaNs are treated as True, Nones are treated as False.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reach parity with pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `skipna` parameter of `DataFrame.all` is supported.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>>

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.lpadRpadAlwaysReturnString` for the breaking change introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34154.\r\n\r\nThe flag is disabled by default. When it is enabled, restore the pre-change behavior that there is no special handling on `BINARY` input types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe original commit is a breaking change, and breaking changes should be encouraged to add a flag to turn it off for smooth migration between versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWith the default value of the conf, there is no user-facing difference.\r\nIf users turn this conf on, they can restore the pre-change behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThrough unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds a legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.allowZeroIndexInFormatString` for the breaking change introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34313 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34454 (followup).\r\n\r\nThe flag is disabled by default. But when it is enabled, restore the pre-change behavior that allows the 0 based index in `format_string`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe original commit is a breaking change, and breaking changes should be encouraged to add a flag to turn it off for smooth migration between versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWith the default value of the conf, there is no user-facing difference.\r\nIf users turn this conf on, they can restore the pre-change behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThrough unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-07T16:28:49Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T02:34:07Z","closed_at":"2022-04-08T01:39:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d162e8edabeedacda8d9004494af4a234b35270","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ad58a158193fcdfb9301ad92e740941a93f851e","head":{"label":"anchovYu:flags-format-string-java","ref":"flags-format-string-java","sha":"1ad58a158193fcdfb9301ad92e740941a93f851e","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to fix a bug in the new function `try_sum`. It should return null if overflow happens before merging the sums from map tasks.\r\nFor example: \r\nMAP TASK 1: partial aggregation TRY_SUM(large_numbers_column) -> overflows, turns into NULL\r\nMAP TASK 2: partial aggregation TRY_SUM(large_numbers_column) -> succeeds, returns 12345\r\nREDUCE TASK: merge TRY_SUM(NULL, 12345) -> returns 12345\r\n\r\nWe should use a new slot buffer `isEmpty` to track if there is a non-empty value in partial aggregation. If the partial result is null and there is non-empty value, the merge result should be `NULL`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new function is not release yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-04-07T11:27:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T01:32:35Z","closed_at":"2022-04-08T01:32:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a59d8bc32b04f2853eb3d636df469a4fe1e43749","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7a75b7c5f7a1209d753f00fa1d8270672f5e1fa","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixTrySum","ref":"fixTrySum","sha":"d7a75b7c5f7a1209d753f00fa1d8270672f5e1fa","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to document the supported pandas version for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince the behavior of pandas is different per its version, it would be better explicitly documenting the supported pandas version so that users won't confuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now the supported pandas version is mentioned to the PySpark API reference page as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1109\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-08 at 10 35 28 AM\"

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove TimestampNTZ type support in the production code of Spark 3.3. \r\nTo archive the goal, this PR adds the check \"Utils.isTesting\" in the following code branches:\r\n- keyword \"timestamp_ntz\" and \"timestamp_ltz\" in parser\r\n- New expressions from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35662\r\n- Using java.time.localDateTime as the external type for TimestampNTZType\r\n- `SQLConf.timestampType` which determines the default timestamp type of Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nThis is to minimize the code difference between the master branch. So that future users won't think TimestampNTZ is already available in Spark 3.3.\r\nThe downside is that users can still find TimestampNTZType under package `org.apache.spark.sql.types`. There should be nothing left other than this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe TimestampNTZ project is not finished yet:\r\n* Lack Hive metastore support\r\n* Lack JDBC support\r\n* Need to spend time scanning the codebase to find out any missing support. The current code usages of `TimestampType` are larger than `TimestampNTZType`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the TimestampNTZ type is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-04-07T02:44:46Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T03:03:37Z","closed_at":"2022-04-08T13:00:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0be8da13c93b2a284dd1b6f7446b09b8922a092a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8e882956c9575da930587d4027a14f302d11acb","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:disableNTZ","ref":"disableNTZ","sha":"d8e882956c9575da930587d4027a14f302d11acb","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","receive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN commands with DEFAULT values.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(i BOOLEAN) USING PARQUET;\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN s STRING DEFAULT CONCAT('abc', 'def');\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES(TRUE, DEFAULT);\r\nSELECT s FROM t WHERE i = TRUE;\r\n> \"abcdef\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis reduces work for users to write INSERT INTO commands into tables by allowing them to leave out some of the column values in reasonable ways.\r\n\r\nIt also helps table owners add columns with values to auto-generate useful information into the table contents, such as date or time values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it allows ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN commands to specify optional DEFAULT values for the columns. These default values are stored inside the column metadata.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test coverage was added as part of this PR.","created_at":"2022-04-06T23:59:26Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T06:43:40Z","closed_at":"2022-04-19T06:43:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f1e2a5c9a8653b7153addafb9ab1b661154c085","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c08b526bce3fdfd39d809d7236e341bdc293e54","head":{"label":"dtenedor:alter-table-add-column","ref":"alter-table-add-column","sha":"5c08b526bce3fdfd39d809d7236e341bdc293e54","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"61aa65d9f897f29813cbbc77b6d0dbad770c8954","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the symmetric has join state manager, we can receive entries with null values for a key and that can cause the `removeByValue` and get iterators to fail and run into the NullPointerException. This is possible if the state recovered is written from an old spark version or its corrupted on disk or due to issues with the iterators. Since we don't have a utility to query this state, we would like to provide a conf option to skip nulls for the symmetric hash implementation in stream stream joins.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout these changes, if we encounter null values for stream-stream joins, the executor task will repeatedly fail with NullPointerException and will terminate the stage and eventually the query as well. This change allows the user to set a config option to continue iterating by skipping null values for symmetric hash based implementation of stream-stream joins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests to test the new functionality by adding nulls in between and forcing the iteration/get calls with nulls in the mix and tested the behavior with the config disabled as well as enabled.\r\nSample output:\r\n```\r\n[info] SymmetricHashJoinStateManagerSuite:\r\n15:07:50.627 WARN

Additionally Java users should be able to use `Dataset.observe(String, ..)` per `@varargs`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. CI should verify the changes too.","created_at":"2022-04-06T05:07:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:41Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T08:26:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"40eb8f5ebcd61861fd5c18d90422ba9fadee4b67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c768f176cda6e5c490122e2e01b11ab612902939","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:minor-docs","ref":"minor-docs","sha":"c768f176cda6e5c490122e2e01b11ab612902939","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of Structured Streaming at `DataFrame.observe` in PySpark. This is the same support with the Scala side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor SS users in PySpark to easily monitor their streaming queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. After this PR, PySpark users can do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import count, col, sum, lit\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.streaming import StreamingQueryListener\r\n\r\nclass MyListener(StreamingQueryListener):\r\n    def onQueryStarted(self, event):\r\n        pass\r\n    def onQueryProgress(self, event):\r\n        row = event.progress.observedMetrics.get(\"metric\")\r\n        # Do something with the metric, e.g.) row.cnt and row.sum\r\n        print(\"Count: %s\" % row.cnt)\r\n    def onQueryTerminated(self, event):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\nspark.streams.addListener(MyListener())\r\n\r\ndf = spark.readStream.format(\"rate\").option(\"rowsPerSecond\", 10).load()\r\nobserved_df = df.observe(\"metric\", count(lit(1)).alias(\"cnt\"), sum(col(\"value\")).alias(\"sum\"))\r\nobserved_df.writeStream.format(\"noop\").queryName(\"test\").start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with the example above, and unit test was added.","created_at":"2022-04-06T04:58:35Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:38Z","closed_at":"2022-04-07T15:39:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fae615607ab5cbfc797160c0a0e002add67f17e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to migrate Junit 4 to Junit 5 jupiter api, the main changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Change JUnit 4 related test dependencies to JUnit 5 to ensure Maven and SBT can run JUnit test normally: `junit` -> `junit-jupiter`, `com.github.sbt:junit-interface` -> `net.aichler:jupiter-interface`, `jmock-junit4` -> `jmock-junit5` and add `sbt-jupiter-interface` plugin to plugins.sbt\r\n2. API migration：\r\n2.1 Annotations reside in the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package\r\n2.2 `@Before` and `@After` no longer exist, use `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` instead\r\n2.3 `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` no longer exist, use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` instead\r\n2.4 `@Ignore` no longer exists, use `@Disabled` instead\r\n2.5 `Assertions` reside in `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` and the assertion api with error message has a little changes there are a few api changes, for example: `assertEquals(\"my message\", 1, 2)` -> `assertEquals(1, 2, \"my message\")`\r\n2.6 Assumptions reside in `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJUnit5 is a powerful and flexible update to the JUnit framework, and it provides a variety of improvements and new features to organize and\r\ndescribe test cases, as well as help in understanding test results：\r\n1. JUnit 5 leverages features from Java 8 or later, such as lambda functions, making tests more powerful and easier to maintain, but Junit 4 still a Java 7 compatible version\r\n2. JUnit 5 has added some useful new features for describing, organizing, and executing tests. For examples: [Parameterized Tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests) and [Conditional Test Execution](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-conditions) may make our test code look simpler, [Parallel Execution](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution) may make our test faster\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-06T02:40:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T08:52:36Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T08:52:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a316399a39c99928f675d7c4d3d0c15f8c77210","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

change?\r\nYes.  `return_indexer` parameter of `Index/MultiIndex.sort_values` is supported as below.\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n```py\r\n        >>> idx = ps.Index([10, 100, 1, 1000])\r\n        >>> idx\r\n        Int64Index([10, 100, 1, 1000], dtype='int64')\r\n\r\n        >>> idx.sort_values(ascending=False, return_indexer=True)\r\n        (Int64Index([1000, 100, 10, 1], dtype='int64'), Int64Index([3, 1, 0, 2], dtype='int64'))\r\n```\r\nMultiIndex\r\n```py\r\n        >>> psidx = ps.MultiIndex.from_tuples([('a', 'x', 1), ('c', 'y', 2), ('b', 'z', 3)])\r\n        >>> psidx\r\n        MultiIndex([('a', 'x', 1),\r\n                    ('c', 'y', 2),\r\n                    ('b', 'z', 3)],\r\n                   )\r\n\r\n        >>> psidx.sort_values(ascending=False, return_indexer=True)\r\n        (MultiIndex([('c', 'y', 2),\r\n                    ('b', 'z', 3),\r\n                    ('a', 'x', 1)],\r\n                   ), Int64Index([1, 2, 0], dtype='int64'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new trait `QueryErrorsBase` which is supposed to be used by `Query.*Errors`, and new method `toSQLValue()`. The method converts a parameter value of error classes to its SQL representation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. Users should see values in error messages in unified SQL style.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn stream-stream joins, for removing old state (watermark by value), we call the `removeByValue` function with a removal condition. Within the iterator returned, if we find null at the end for matched value at non-last index, we are currently not removing and swapping the matched value. With this change, we will find the first non-null value from end and swap current index with that value and remove all elements from index + 1 to the end and then drop the last element as before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change fixes a bug where we were not replacing found/matching values for `removeByValue` when encountering nulls in the symmetric hash join code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a unit test for this change with nulls added.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd checks in `ResolveFunctions#validateFunction` to ensure the following about each aggregate filter:\r\n\r\n- has a datatype of boolean\r\n- doesn't contain an aggregate expression\r\n- doesn't contain a window expression\r\n\r\n`ExtractGenerator` already handles the case of a generator in an aggregate filter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are three cases where a query with an aggregate filter produces non-helpful error messages.\r\n\r\n1) Window expression in aggregate filter\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect sum(a) filter (where nth_value(a, 2) over (order by b) > 1)\r\nfrom (select 1 a, '2' b);\r\n```\r\nThe above query should produce an analysis error, but instead produces a stack

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen we use a partition table, if the filesystem of partition location is different from the filesystem of the table location,\r\nwe will get an exception like that：`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: s3a://path/to/spark3_snap/dt=2020-09-10, expected: hdfs://cluster`,\r\nbecause `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol` will use the filesystem of the table location to operate the file.\r\nFor example, the following SQL will cause the above exception:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE `spark3_snap`( `id` string) PARTITIONED BY (`dt` string)\r\nSTORED AS ORC LOCATION 'hdfs://path/to/spark3_snap';\r\n\r\n-- The file system of the partition location is different from the filesystem of the table location,\r\n-- one is S3A, the other

This PR completely replace it following the catalyst `Partitioning` interface, and added two concrete sub-classes: `KeyGroupedPartitioning` and `UnknownPartitioning`. This allows a V2 data source to report to Spark it's partition transform expressions, via `SupportsReportPartitioning` interface.\r\n- with the above change, `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioning.Distribution` and `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.read.partitioning.ClusteredDistribution` now are replaced by classes with the same name in `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.distributions` package. Therefore, this PR marks the former two as deprecated.\r\n- `DataSourcePartitioning` used to be in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2`. This moves it into package `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.physical` and renames it to `KeyGroupedPartitioning`, so that it can be extended for more non-V2 use cases, such as Hive bucketing. In addition, it is also changed to accommodate the Storage-Partitioned Join feature.\r\n- a new expression type: `TransformExpression`, is introduced to bind syntactic partition transforms with their semantic meaning, represented by a V2 function. This expression is un-evaluable for now, and is used later in `EnsureRequirements` to check whether join children are compatible with each other.\r\n- a new optimizer rule: `V2ScanPartitioning`, is added to recognize `Scan`s implement `SupportsReportPartitioning`. If they do, this rule converts V2 partition transform expressions into their counterparts in catalyst, and annotate `DataSourceV2ScanRelation` with the result. These are later propagated into `DataSourceV2ScanExecBase`.\r\n- changes are made in `DataSourceV2ScanExecBase` to create `KeyGroupedPartitioning` for scan if 1) the scan is annotated with catalyst partition transform expressions, and 2) if all input splits implement `HasPartitionKey`.\r\n- A new config: `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` is introduced to turn on or off the behavior. By default it is false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark currently support bucketing in DataSource V1, but not in V2. This is the first step to support bucket join, and is general form, storage-partitioned join, for V2 data sources. In addition, the work here can potentially used to support Hive bucketing as well. Please check the SPIP for details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the changes, a user can now:\r\n- have V2 data sources to report distribution and ordering to Spark on read path\r\n- Spark will recognize the distribution property and eliminate shuffle in join/aggregate/window, etc, when the source distribution matches the required distribution from these.\r\n- a new config `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.enabled` is introduced to turn on/off the above behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21127 supports storing the aggregated stats automatically at table level with the config `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled`.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update partition statistics automatically at the same time when the `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled` config is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupporting partition level stats are useful to know which partitions are outliers (skewed partition) and query optimizer works better with partition level stats in case of partition pruning.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the `to_number` and `try_to_number` SQL function expressions according to new semantics described below. The former is equivalent to the latter except that it throws an exception instead of returning NULL for cases where the input string does not match the format string.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n# `try_to_number` function\r\n\r\nReturns `expr` cast to DECIMAL using formatting `fmt`, or `NULL` if `expr` is not a valid match for the given format.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry_to_number(expr, fmt)\r\nfmt\r\n  { ' [ S ] [ L | $ ] \r\n      [ 0 | 9 | G | , ] [...] \r\n      [ . | D ] \r\n      [ 0 | 9 ] [...] \r\n      [ L | $ ] [ PR | MI | S ] ' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Arguments\r\n\r\n- `expr`: A STRING expression representing a number. `expr` may include leading or trailing spaces.\r\n- `fmt`: An STRING literal, specifying the expected format of `expr`.\r\n\r\n## Returns\r\n\r\nA DECIMAL(p, s) where `p` is the total number of digits (`0` or `9`) and `s` is the number of digits after the decimal point, or 0 if there is none.\r\n\r\n`fmt` can contain the following elements (case insensitive):\r\n\r\n- **`0`** or **`9`**\r\n\r\n  Specifies an expected digit between `0` and `9`. \r\n  A `0` to the left of the decimal points indicates that `expr` must have at least as many digits.\r\n  A leading `9` indicates that `expr` may omit these digits.\r\n\r\n  `expr` must not be larger than the number of digits to the left of the decimal point allowed by the format string.\r\n\r\n  Digits to the right of the decimal point in the format string indicate the most digits that `expr` may have to the right of the decimal point.\r\n\r\n- **`.`** or **`D`**\r\n\r\n  Specifies the position of the decimal point.\r\n\r\n  `expr` does not need to include a decimal point.\r\n\r\n- **`,`** or **`G`**\r\n\r\n  Specifies the position of the `,` grouping (thousands) separator.\r\n  There must be a `0` or `9` to the left of the rightmost grouping separator. \r\n  `expr` must match the grouping separator relevant for the size of the number. \r\n\r\n- **`L`** or **`$`**\r\n\r\n  Specifies the location of the `$` currency sign. This character may only be specified once.\r\n\r\n- **`S`** \r\n\r\n  Specifies the position of an option '+' or '-' sign. This character may only be specified once.\r\n\r\n- **`MI`**\r\n\r\n  Specifies that `expr` has an optional `-` sign at the end, but no `+`.\r\n\r\n- **`PR`**\r\n\r\n  Specifies that `expr` indicates a negative number with wrapping angled brackets (`<1>`).\r\n\r\nIf `expr` contains any characters other than `0` through `9` and those permitted in `fmt` a `NULL` is returned.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- The format expects:\r\n--  * an optional sign at the beginning,\r\n--  * followed by a dollar sign,\r\n--  * followed by a number between 3 and 6 digits long,\r\n--  * thousands separators,\r\n--  * up to two dights beyond the decimal point. \r\n> SELECT try_to_number('-$12,345.67', 'S$999,099.99');\r\n -12345.67\r\n-- The plus sign is optional, and so are fractional digits.\r\n> SELECT try_to_number('$345', 'S$999,099.99');\r\n 345.00\r\n-- The format requires at least three digits.\r\n> SELECT try_to_number('$45', 'S$999,099.99');\r\n NULL\r\n-- The format requires at least three digits.\r\n> SELECT try_to_number('$045', 'S$999,099.99');\r\n 45.00\r\n-- Using brackets to denote negative values\r\n> SELECT try_to_number('<1234>', '999999PR');\r\n -1234\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new semantics bring Spark into consistency with other engines and grant the user flexibility about how to handle cases where inputs do not match the format string.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n* The minus sign `-` is no longer supported in the format string (`S` replaces it).\r\n*

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen calling a Python UDF on a DataFrame with large rows, a deadlock can occur involving the following three threads:\r\n\r\n1. The Scala task executor thread. During task execution, this is responsible for reading output produced by the Python process. However, in this case the task has finished early, and this thread is no longer reading output produced by the Python process. Instead, it is waiting for the Scala WriterThread to exit so that it can finish the task.\r\n2. The Scala WriterThread. This is trying to send a large row to the Python process, and is waiting for the Python process to read that row.\r\n3. The Python process. This is trying to send a large output to the Scala task executor thread, and is waiting for that thread to read that output, which will never happen.\r\n\r\nWe considered the following three solutions for the deadlock:\r\n\r\n1. When the task completes, make the Scala task executor thread close the socket before waiting for the Scala WriterThread to exit. If the WriterThread is blocked on a large write, this would interrupt that write and allow the WriterThread to exit. However, it would prevent Python worker reuse.\r\n2. Modify PythonWorkerFactory to use interruptible I/O. [java.nio.channels.SocketChannel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SocketChannel.html#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer)) supports interruptible blocking operations. The goal is that when the WriterThread is interrupted, it should exit even if it was blocked on a large write. However, this would be invasive.\r\n3. Add a watchdog thread similar to the existing PythonRunner.MonitorThread to detect this deadlock and kill the Python worker. The MonitorThread currently kills the Python worker only if the task itself is interrupted. In this case, the task completes normally, so the MonitorThread does not take action. We want the new watchdog thread (WriterMonitorThread) to detect that the task is completed but the Python writer thread has not stopped, indicating a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Option 3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a deadlock that can cause PySpark queries to hang.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test that previously encountered the deadlock and timed out, and now succeeds.","created_at":"2022-04-04T19:32:04Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T04:50:59Z","closed_at":"2022-04-12T03:01:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7dde366158974e0ad4be1d97f81fd1d8af72e44f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/019cf6a67475e061246c78dbf5b843899919ab95","head":{"label":"ankurdave:SPARK-38677","ref":"SPARK-38677","sha":"019cf6a67475e061246c78dbf5b843899919ab95","user":{"login":"ankurdave","id":408432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODQzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave","html_url":"https://github.com/ankurdave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18090820,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODA5MDgyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"ankurdave/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ankurdave","id":408432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODQzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave","html_url":"https://github.com/ankurdave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ankurdave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ankurdave/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to release the ShuffleManagedBufferIterator or ShuffleChunkManagedBufferIterator or ManagedBufferIterator buffers when the client channel's connection is terminated.\r\n\r\nIf a  client connection is closed before the iterator is fully drained, then the remaining materialized buffers should all be released, but some buffers like `ShuffleManagedBufferIterator`, `ShuffleChunkManagedBufferIterator`, `ManagedBufferIterator` are not materialized until the iterator is traversed by calling next(),  so we should not traverse and release them in order to avoid unnecessary buffer materialization,  which could be I/O based.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce I/O operations  for the External Shuffle Service.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unittests.\r\n\r\nCloses #36000 from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to release the ShuffleManagedBufferIterator or ShuffleChunkManagedBufferIterator or ManagedBufferIterator buffers when the client channel's connection is terminated.\r\n\r\nIf a  client connection is closed before the iterator is fully drained, then the remaining materialized buffers should all be released, but some buffers like `ShuffleManagedBufferIterator`, `ShuffleChunkManagedBufferIterator`, `ManagedBufferIterator` are not materialized until the iterator is traversed by calling next(),  so we should not traverse and release them in order to avoid unnecessary buffer materialization,  which could be I/O based.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce I/O operations  for the External Shuffle Service.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unittests.\r\n\r\nCloses #36000 from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add option \"-W\" when running PySpark documentation build via Sphinx.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make documentation build failing when the documentation violates the Sphinx warning rules.\r\n\r\nSo far, the docs build is passed although the docs has warnings as below:\r\n```\r\n…\r\nbuild succeeded, 14 warnings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, the warnings treated as error, so the build should be failed as below for an example:\r\n```\r\nWarning, treated as error:\r\n…:153:Malformed table.\r\nText in column margin in table line 38.\r\n…\r\nmake: *** [html] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis would make docs a bit more prettier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing build & tests should be passed.","created_at":"2022-04-04T04:49:47Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:42:48Z","closed_at":"2022-04-04T06:19:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b604ccf9439d28efd45c7a0c7aea2d295a54155","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/874a5b05f3f647e9a57b1c6a7b86b5689940550f","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-38780","ref":"SPARK-38780","sha":"874a5b05f3f647e9a57b1c6a7b86b5689940550f","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor the current data source insert SQL commit protocol, it has below problems:\r\n**case a**: both job A and job B write data into partitioned table TBL with different statistic partition, it will have conflict since they use the same temp location ${table_location}/_temporary/0/....,\r\nwhen job A has finished and then it will clean this temp location, then cause job B’s temp data is cleared. Then it will cause job B to fail to write data.\r\n**case b**: for the current dynamic partition insert, if we kill a job writing data, will remain data under table location in the staging dir under table path.\r\n**case c**: If we use a dynamic partition insert to insert a new table with a huge number of partitions, we need to move partition paths one by one, for this case, we can just rename stagingdir path to the table path to make it more quickly. But if we want to do this, we need to make staging dir can be customized and should not use the staging path under table location.\r\n \r\nIn this approach, we plan to add a new build in the SQL Commit protocol.\r\nIn this new SQL commit protocol ** SQLOverwriteHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol** , \r\nWe defined a new staging path that parallel to the target table path as\r\n`new Path(new Path(targetTablePath).getParent, s\".${new Path(targetTablePath).getName}-spark-staging-\" + jobId)`.\r\nAnd we only change the behavior of **_overwrite mode_**. In overwrite mode:\r\n\r\n**for non-partition insert:**\r\n\r\n    1. Spark won't delete the target table location before computing.\r\n    2. Before job commit, data have been computed and stored in staging dir\r\n    3. Before calling output committer's `commitJob`, we delete the target table location\r\n    4. After calling output committer's `commitJob`, we rename staging dir to target table location\r\n \r\n**for all static partition insert:**\r\n\r\n    1.  Spark won't delete the matching partition before computing.\r\n    2. Before job commit, data have been computed and stored in staging dir\r\n    3. Before calling output committer's `commitJob`, we delete the matching partition\r\n    4. During the `commitJob` partition (with custom partition path) 's data have been written to the custom partition path\r\n    5. After calling the output committer's `commitJob`, if the custom partition path is not empty, result data have been written to target the custom partition path during commitJob. otherwise spark will rename staging dir to the target partition location\r\n\r\n \r\n**for dynamic partition insert**:  all same behaviors as `SQLHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol`.\r\n\r\n**for dynamic partition overwrite in static mode**\r\n\r\n    1.  Spark won't delete the matching partition before computing.\r\n    2. Before job commit, data have been computed and stored in staging dir\r\n    3. Before calling output committer's `commitJob`, we delete the matching partition\r\n    4. During the `commitJob` partition (with custom partition path) 's data have been written to the custom partition path\r\n    5. After calling output committer's `commitJob`, we rename staging dir to the target location for renamed normal partition path.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide new build-in sql
