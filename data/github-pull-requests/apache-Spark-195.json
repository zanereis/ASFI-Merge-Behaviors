What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the representation to clarify the meaning of \"number of rows dropped by watermark\" in SS UI page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`Aggregated Number Of State Rows Dropped By Watermark` says that the dropped rows are from the state, whereas they're not. We say \"evicted from the state\" for the case, which is \"normal\" to emit outputs and reduce memory usage of the state.\r\n\r\nThe metric actually represents the number of \"input\" rows dropped by watermark, and the meaning of \"input\" is relative to the \"stateful operator\". That's a bit confusing as we normally think \"input\" as \"input from source\" whereas it's not.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, UI element & tooltip change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nOnly text change in UI, so we know how thing will be changed intuitively.","created_at":"2020-11-20T04:00:45Z","updated_at":"2020-11-21T01:27:36Z","closed_at":"2020-11-21T01:27:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"400bf7b905447fdcc548164f6a01881e113b9e84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

#30373 for branch-3.0.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR switched the order for the rule `RemoveRedundantSorts` and `EnsureRequirements` so that `EnsureRequirements` will be invoked before `RemoveRedundantSorts` to avoid IllegalArgumentException when instantiating PartitioningCollection.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`RemoveRedundantSorts` rule uses SparkPlan's `outputPartitioning` to check whether a sort node is redundant. Currently, it is added before `EnsureRequirements`. Since `PartitioningCollection` requires left and right partitioning to have the same number of partitions, which is not necessarily true before applying `EnsureRequirements`, the rule can fail with the following exception:\r\n```\r\nIllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: PartitioningCollection requires all of its partitionings have the same numPartitions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

#30373 for branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR switched the order for the rule `RemoveRedundantSorts` and `EnsureRequirements` so that `EnsureRequirements` will be invoked before `RemoveRedundantSorts` to avoid IllegalArgumentException when instantiating PartitioningCollection.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`RemoveRedundantSorts` rule uses SparkPlan's `outputPartitioning` to check whether a sort node is redundant. Currently, it is added before `EnsureRequirements`. Since `PartitioningCollection` requires left and right partitioning to have the same number of partitions, which is not necessarily true before applying `EnsureRequirements`, the rule can fail with the following exception:\r\n```\r\nIllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: PartitioningCollection requires all of its partitionings have the same numPartitions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Fixes for bugs in `RemoteBlockPushResolver` where the number of chunks in meta file and index file are inconsistent due to exceptions while writing to either index file or meta file. This java class was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30062.\r\n - If the writing to index file fails, the position of meta file is not reset. This means that the number of chunks in meta file is inconsistent with index file. \r\n- During the exception handling while writing to index/meta file, we just set the pointer to the start position. If the files are closed just after this then it doesn't get rid of any the extra bytes written to it.\r\n2. Adds an IOException threshold. If the `RemoteBlockPushResolver` encounters IOExceptions greater than this threshold  while updating data/meta/index file of a shuffle partition, then it responds to the client with  exception- `IOExceptions exceeded the threshold` so that client can stop pushing data for this shuffle partition.\r\n3. When the update to metadata fails, exception is not propagated back to the client. This results in the increased size of the current chunk. However, with (2) in place, the current chunk will still be of a manageable size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fix is needed for the bugs mentioned above.\r\n1. Moved writing to meta file after index file. This fixes the issue because if there is an exception writing to meta file, then the index file position is not updated. With this change, if there is an exception writing to index file, then none of the files are effectively updated and the same is true vice-versa.\r\n2. Truncating the lengths of data/index/meta files when the partition is finalized.\r\n3. When the IOExceptions have reached the threshold, it is most likely that future blocks will also face the issue. So, it is better to let the clients know so that they can stop pushing the blocks for that partition.\r\n4. When just the meta update fails, client retries pushing the block which was successfully merged to data file. This can be avoided by letting the chunk grow slightly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests for all the bugs and threshold.","created_at":"2020-11-19T20:08:13Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T03:48:34Z","closed_at":"2020-12-23T18:42:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f3143513c6048c495580aa83ab05b1cf50b06b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f48d52f68e52b63742e7cce5dbb4fbcc89845402","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-32916-followup","ref":"SPARK-32916-followup","sha":"f48d52f68e52b63742e7cce5dbb4fbcc89845402","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR updates `ShuffleExchangeExec` to carry more information about how much we can change the partitioning. For `repartition(col)`, we should preserve the user-specified partitioning and don't apply the AQE local shuffle reader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar to `repartition(number, col)`, we should respect the user-specified partitioning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds changes in the following places:\r\n- logic to also refresh caches referencing the target table in v2 `AppendDataExec`, `OverwriteByExpressionExec`, `OverwritePartitionsDynamicExec`, as well as their v1 fallbacks `AppendDataExecV1` and `OverwriteByExpressionExecV1`.\r\n- logic to invalidate caches referencing the target table in v2 `ReplaceTableAsSelectExec` and its atomic version `AtomicReplaceTableAsSelectExec`. These are only supported in v2 at the moment though.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, in order to test the v1 write fallback behavior, I extended `InMemoryTableWithV1Fallback` to also support batch reads.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in DataSource v2 we don't refresh or invalidate caches referencing the target table when the table content is changed by operations such as append, overwrite, or replace table. This is different from DataSource v1, and could potentially cause data correctness issue if the staled caches are queried later. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now When a data source v2 is cached (either directly or indirectly), all the relevant caches will be refreshed or invalidated if the table is replaced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the new code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the watermark gap information in SS UI page. Please refer below screenshots to see what we'd like to show in UI.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-11-19 at 6 56 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/99669306-3532d080-2ab2-11eb-9a93-03d2c6a54948.png)\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR doesn't plot the watermark value - knowing the gap between actual wall clock and watermark looks more useful than the absolute value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWatermark is the one of major metrics the end users need to track for stateful queries. Watermark defines \"when\" the output will be emitted for append mode, hence knowing how much gap between wall clock and watermark (input data) is very helpful to make expectation of the output.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, SS UI query page will contain the watermark gap information.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBasic UT added. Manually tested with two queries:\r\n\r\n> simple case\r\n\r\nYou'll see consistent watermark gap with (15 seconds + a) = 10 seconds are from delay in watermark definition, 5 seconds are trigger interval.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.Trigger\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"10\")\r\n\r\nval query = spark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .format(\"rate\")\r\n  .option(\"rowsPerSecond\", 1000)\r\n  .option(\"rampUpTime\", \"10s\")\r\n  .load()\r\n  .selectExpr(\"timestamp\", \"mod(value, 100) as mod\", \"value\")\r\n  .withWatermark(\"timestamp\", \"10 seconds\")\r\n  .groupBy(window($\"timestamp\", \"1 minute\", \"10 seconds\"), $\"mod\")\r\n  .agg(max(\"value\").as(\"max_value\"), min(\"value\").as(\"min_value\"), avg(\"value\").as(\"avg_value\"))\r\n  .writeStream\r\n  .format(\"console\")\r\n  .trigger(Trigger.ProcessingTime(\"5 seconds\"))\r\n  .outputMode(\"append\")\r\n  .start()\r\n\r\nquery.awaitTermination()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-11-19 at 7 00 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/99669049-dbcaa180-2ab1-11eb-8789-10b35857dda0.png)\r\n\r\n> complicated case\r\n\r\nThis randomizes the timestamp, hence producing random watermark gap. This won't be smaller than 15 seconds as I described earlier.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.Trigger\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"10\")\r\n\r\nval query = spark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .format(\"rate\")\r\n  .option(\"rowsPerSecond\", 1000)\r\n  .option(\"rampUpTime\", \"10s\")\r\n  .load()\r\n  .selectExpr(\"*\", \"CAST(CAST(timestamp AS BIGINT) - CAST((RAND() * 100000) AS BIGINT) AS TIMESTAMP) AS tsMod\")\r\n  .selectExpr(\"tsMod\", \"mod(value, 100) as mod\", \"value\")\r\n  .withWatermark(\"tsMod\", \"10 seconds\")\r\n  .groupBy(window($\"tsMod\", \"1 minute\", \"10 seconds\"), $\"mod\")\r\n  .agg(max(\"value\").as(\"max_value\"), min(\"value\").as(\"min_value\"), avg(\"value\").as(\"avg_value\"))\r\n

Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30391. Note that it's a partial backport.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n- Add `~/.sbt` directory into the build cache, see also https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3681\r\n- ~Move `hadoop-2` below to put up together with `java-11` and `scala-213`, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30391#discussion_r524881430~\r\n- Remove unnecessary `.m2` cache if you run SBT tests only.\r\n- Remove `rm ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark`. If you don't `sbt publishLocal` or `mvn install`, we don't need to care about it.\r\n- ~Use Java 8 in Scala 2.13 build. We can switch the Java version to 11 used for release later.~\r\n- Add caches into linters. The linter scripts uses `sbt` in, for example, `./dev/lint-scala`, and uses `mvn` in, for example, `./dev/lint-java`. Also, it requires to `sbt package` in Jekyll build, see: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/_plugins/copy_api_dirs.rb#L160-L161. We need full caches here for SBT, Maven and build tools.\r\n- Use the same syntax of Java version, 1.8 -> 8.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Remove unnecessary stuff\r\n- Cache what we can in the build\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt will be tested in GitHub Actions build at the current PR\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-19T03:10:01Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:21Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T05:22:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30fbbd2d25a275c0dbec54f86356d2026216adc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30417/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30417/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30417/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/832db13d185d9e1054ae2c80307923226e3850a7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33464-2.4","ref":"SPARK-33464-2.4","sha":"832db13d185d9e1054ae2c80307923226e3850a7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30391. Note that it's a partial backport.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n- Add `~/.sbt` directory into the build cache, see also https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3681\r\n- ~Move `hadoop-2` below to put up together with `java-11` and `scala-213`, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30391#discussion_r524881430~\r\n- Remove unnecessary `.m2` cache if you run SBT tests only.\r\n- Remove `rm ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark`. If you don't `sbt publishLocal` or `mvn install`, we don't need to care about it.\r\n- ~Use Java 8 in Scala 2.13 build. We can switch the Java version to 11 used for release later.~\r\n- Add caches into linters. The linter scripts uses `sbt` in, for example, `./dev/lint-scala`, and uses `mvn` in, for example, `./dev/lint-java`. Also, it requires to `sbt package` in Jekyll build, see: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/_plugins/copy_api_dirs.rb#L160-L161. We need full caches here for SBT, Maven and build tools.\r\n- Use the same syntax of Java version, 1.8 -> 8.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Remove unnecessary stuff\r\n- Cache what we can in the build\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt will be tested in GitHub Actions build at the current PR\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-19T02:27:37Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:21Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T04:14:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d2d199cb22096bb3e9b7cf72bf10dfe8d5fa1d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91f78530c578fa2c58ec954febcab4441caafa57","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33464-3.0","ref":"SPARK-33464-3.0","sha":"91f78530c578fa2c58ec954febcab4441caafa57","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis followup is to prevent possible test flakyness of `SubExprEvaluationRuntimeSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause HashMap doesn't guarantee the order, in `proxyExpressions` the proxy expression id is not deterministic.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds the char/varchar type which is kind of a variant of string type:\r\n1. Char type is fixed-length string. When comparing char type values, we need to pad the shorter one to the longer length.\r\n2. Varchar type is string with a length limitation.\r\n\r\nTo implement the char/varchar semantic, this PR:\r\n1. Do string length check when writing to char/varchar type columns.\r\n2. Do string padding when reading char type columns. We don't do it at the writing side to save storage space.\r\n3. Do string padding when comparing char type column with string literal or another char type column. (string literal is fixed length so should be treated as char type as well)\r\n\r\nTo simplify the implementation, this PR doesn't propagate char/varchar type info through functions/operators(e.g. `substring`). That said, a column can only be char/varchar type if it's a table column, not a derived column like `SELECT substring(col)`.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, this PR doesn't add char/varchar type to the query engine(expression input check, internal row framework, codegen framework, etc.). We will replace char/varchar type by string type with metadata (`Attribute.metadata` or `StructField.metadata`) that includes the original type string before it goes into the query engine. That said, the existing code will not see char/varchar type but only string type.\r\n\r\nchar/varchar type may come from several places:\r\n1. v1 table from hive catalog.\r\n2. v2 table from v2 catalog.\r\n3. user-specified schema in `spark.read.schema` and `spark.readStream.schema`\r\n4. `Column.cast`\r\n5. schema string in places like `from_json`, pandas UDF, etc. These places use SQL parser which replaces char/varchar with string already, even before this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR covers all the above cases, implements the length check and padding feature by looking at string type with special metadata.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nchar and varchar are standard SQL types. varchar is widely used in other databases instead of string type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFor hive tables: now the table insertion fails if the value exceeds char/varchar length. Previously we truncate the value silently.\r\n\r\nFor other tables:\r\n1. now char type is allowed.\r\n2. now we have length check when inserting to varchar columns. Previously we write the value as it is.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTwo new options, _modifiiedBefore_  and _modifiedAfter_, is provided expecting a value in 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss' format.  _PartioningAwareFileIndex_ considers these options during the process of checking for files, just before considering applied _PathFilters_ such as `pathGlobFilter.`  In order to filter file results, a new PathFilter class was derived for this purpose.  General house-keeping around classes extending PathFilter was performed for neatness.  It became apparent support was needed to handle multiple potential path filters.  Logic was introduced for this purpose and the associated tests written.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen loading files from a data source, there can often times be thousands of file within a respective file path.  In many cases I've seen, we want to start loading from a folder path and ideally be able to begin loading files having modification dates past a certain point.  This would mean out of thousands of potential files, only the ones with modification dates greater than the specified timestamp would be considered.  This saves a ton of time automatically and reduces significant complexity managing this in code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an option that can be used with batch-based Spark file data sources.  A documentation update was made to reflect an example and usage of the new data source option.\r\n\r\n**Example Usages**  \r\n_Load all CSV files modified after date:_ \r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedAfter\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()`\r\n\r\n_Load all CSV files modified before date:_\r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedBefore\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()`  \r\n\r\n_Load all CSV files modified between two dates:_ \r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedAfter\",\"2019-01-15T05:00:00\").option(\"modifiedBefore\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()  \r\n`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA handful of unit tests were added to support the positive, negative, and edge case code paths. \r\n\r\nIt's also live in a handful of our Databricks dev environments.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInsert overwrite same table can overwrite a path that is also being read under dynamic partition overwrite\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Insert overwrite cannot overwrite a path that is also being read under dynamic partition overwrite.\r\nIn the class DataSourceAnalysis, DDLUtils.verifyNotReadPath is called to determine whether it can be overwrite, but in the InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand.dynamicPartitionOverwrite method, we need to consider the scenario where staticPartitions.size equals partitionColumns.length, which should also be allowed to overwrite path this is also being read.\r\n\r\nConsider the following statement:\r\nCREATE TABLE insertTable(i int, part1 int, part2 int) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (part1, part2);\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE insertTable PARTITION(part1=1, part2=1) SELECT i + 1 FROM insertTable;\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd test in InsertSuite, start

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake the API key of DocSearch configurable and avoid hardcoding in the HTML template\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30292, our Spark documentation site supports searching.\r\nHowever, the default API key always points to the latest release doc. We have to set different API keys for different releases. Otherwise, the search results are always based on the latest documentation(https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) even when visiting the documentation of previous releases.\r\n\r\nAs per discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30292#issuecomment-725613417, we should make the API key configurable and set different values for different releases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to generalize executor metrics to support user-given file system schemes instead of the fixed `file,hdfs` scheme.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor the users using only cloud storages like `S3A`, we need to be able to expose `S3A` metrics. Also, we can skip unused `hdfs` metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but compatible for the existing users which uses `hdfs` and `file` filesystem scheme only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually do the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phadoop-cloud package\r\n$ sbin/start-master.sh; sbin/start-slave.sh spark://$(hostname):7077\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master spark://$(hostname):7077 -c spark.executor.metrics.fileSystemSchemes=file,s3a -c spark.metrics.conf.executor.sink.jmx.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.JmxSink\r\nscala> spark.read.textFile(\"s3a://dongjoon/README.md\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeparately, launch `jconsole` and check `*.executor.filesystem.s3a.*`. Also, confirm that there is no `*.executor.filesystem.hdfs.*`\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ jconsole\r\n```\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-11-17 at 9 26 03

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to support `CHACHE/UNCACHE TABLE` commands for v2 tables.\r\n\r\nIn addtion, this PR proposes to migrate `CACHE/UNCACHE TABLE` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support `CACHE/UNCACHE TABLE` commands for v2 tables.\r\n\r\nNote that `CACHE/UNCACHE TABLE` for v1 tables/views go through `SparkSession.table` to resolve identifier, which resolves temp views first, so there is no change in the behavior by moving to the new framework.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now the user can run `CACHE/UNCACHE TABLE` commands on v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded/updated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-11-18T04:32:30Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T05:08:05Z","closed_at":"2020-11-30T05:37:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b01c0100bb56b435ea31e6bf4586fd662f929ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e788cea5c2dd03f71ee30b0106e04d7f036f30f","head":{"label":"imback82:cache_table","ref":"cache_table","sha":"7e788cea5c2dd03f71ee30b0106e04d7f036f30f","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to add full outer stream-stream join, and the implementation of full outer join is:\r\n* For left side input row, check if there's a match on right side state store.\r\n  * if there's a match, output the joined row, o.w. output nothing. Put the row in left side state store.\r\n* For right side input row, check if there's a match on left side state store.\r\n  * if there's a match, output the joined row, o.w. output nothing. Put the row in right side state store.\r\n* State store eviction: evict rows from left/right side state store below watermark, and output rows never matched before (a combination of left outer and right outer join).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEnable more use cases for spark stream-stream join.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests in `UnsupportedOperationChecker.scala` and `StreamingJoinSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2020-11-17T08:16:27Z","updated_at":"2020-12-02T01:23:46Z","closed_at":"2020-12-02T01:17:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dedba259af507c148ba35824a67132bb4421d002","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to replace `reduce` API call in `RDD.takeOrdered` with `treeReduce`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`RDD.takeOrdered` API sorts elements in each partition and puts the sorted elements into a `BoundedPriorityQueue`. So actually in the result RDD each partition has only one priority queue. Then the API calls `RDD.reduce` API to reduce the elements. But as mentioned before the RDD has only one queue at each partition, it doesn't make sense to call reduce to reduce elements (here the element is queue).\r\n\r\nWe should either simplify `RDD.reduce` call in `RDD.takeOrdered` by skipping partition processing or replace it with `treeReduce` which can actually do partially reducing for this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2020-11-17T06:12:30Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:21Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T02:31:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f448d17d2022c74b61c44b4e940bd8817b2f5817","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59179f47412e13411da2bc6010b9623f333498d4","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-33465","ref":"SPARK-33465","sha":"59179f47412e13411da2bc6010b9623f333498d4","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n- Add `~/.sbt` directory into the build cache, see also https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/3681\r\n- Move `hadoop-2` below to put up together with `java-11` and `scala-213`, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30391#discussion_r524881430\r\n- Remove unnecessary `.m2` cache if you run SBT tests only.\r\n- Remove `rm ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark`. If you don't `sbt publishLocal` or `mvn install`, we don't need to care about it.\r\n- Use Java 8 in Scala 2.13 build. We can switch the Java version to 11 used for release later.\r\n- Add caches into linters. The linter scripts uses `sbt` in, for example, `./dev/lint-scala`, and uses `mvn` in, for example, `./dev/lint-java`. Also, it requires to `sbt package` in Jekyll build, see: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/_plugins/copy_api_dirs.rb#L160-L161. We need full caches here for SBT, Maven and build tools.\r\n- Use the same syntax of Java version, 1.8 -> 8.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Remove unnecessary stuff\r\n- Cache what we can in the build\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt will be tested in GitHub Actions build at the current

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark creates local server to serialize several type of data for python. The python code tries to connect to the server, immediately after it's created but there are several system calls in between (this may change in each Spark version):\r\n* getaddrinfo\r\n* socket\r\n* settimeout\r\n* connect\r\n\r\nUnder some circumstances in heavy user environments these calls can be super slow (more than 15 seconds). These issues must be analyzed one-by-one but since these are system calls the underlying OS and/or DNS servers must be debugged and fixed. This is not trivial task and at the same time data processing must work somehow. In this PR I'm only intended to add a configuration possibility to increase the mentioned timeouts in order to be able to provide temporary workaround. The rootcause analysis is ongoing but I think this can vary in each case.\r\n\r\nBecause the server part doesn't contain huge amount of log entries to with one can measure time, I've added some.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide workaround when localhost python server connection timeout appears.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, new configuration added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests + manual test.\r\n```\r\n#Compile Spark\r\n\r\necho \"spark.io.encryption.enabled true\" >> conf/spark-defaults.conf\r\necho \"spark.python.authenticate.socketTimeout 10\" >> conf/spark-defaults.conf\r\n\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark \r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Jul 21 2020, 10:48:26) \r\n[Clang 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n20/11/20 10:17:03 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request:\r\n\r\n- Adds following flags to the main mypy configuration:\r\n  - [`strict_optional`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-strict_optional)\r\n  - [`no_implicit_optional`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-no_implicit_optional)\r\n  - [`disallow_untyped_defs`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-disallow_untyped_calls)\r\n\r\nThese flags are enabled only for public API and disabled for tests and internal modules.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these PR fixes missing annotations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Move `SHOW PARTITIONS` parsing tests to `ShowPartitionsParserSuite`\r\n2. Place Hive tests for `SHOW PARTITIONS` from `HiveCommandSuite` to the base test suite `v1.ShowPartitionsSuiteBase`. This will allow to run the tests w/ and w/o Hive.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30287.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The unification will allow to run common `SHOW PARTITIONS` tests for both DSv1 and Hive DSv1, DSv2\r\n- We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

`outputPartitioning` to check whether a sort node is redundant. Currently, it is added before `EnsureRequirements`. Since `PartitioningCollection` requires left and right partitioning to have the same number of partitions, which is not necessarily true before applying `EnsureRequirements`, the rule can fail with

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is based on the master branch, replacing PR #30071 \r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHaving `CodeGenerator.getValueFromVector()` to correctly treat `UserDefniedType`s as `CodeGenerator.javaType()` does.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout it the generated java code would not compile, the error was \r\n```\r\nrg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 153, Column 126: No applicable constructor/method found for actual parameters \"int, int\"; candidates are: \"public org.apache.spark.sql.vectorized.ColumnarRow org.apache.spark.sql.vectorized.ColumnVector.getStruct(int)\"\r\n```\r\nThe fix makes sure the method call has just one parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've added a unit test to verify the proper code is generated:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a simple followup to prevent test flakyness in SubexpressionEliminationSuite. If `getAllEquivalentExprs` returns more than 1 sequences, due to HashMap, we should use `contains` instead of assuming the order of results. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPrevent test flakyness in SubexpressionEliminationSuite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, dev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn Add-hoc scene, we always add limit for the query if user have no special limit value, but not all limit is nesessary.\r\n\r\nA general negative example is \r\n```\r\nselect count(*) from t limit 100000;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will be great if we can eliminate limit at Spark side.\r\n\r\nAlso, we make a benchmark for this case \r\n```\r\nrunBenchmark(\"Sort and Limit\") {\r\n  val N = 100000\r\n  val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"benchmark sort and limit\", N)\r\n\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"TakeOrderedAndProject\", 3) { _ =>\r\n    spark.range(N).toDF(\"c\").repartition(200).sort(\"c\").take(200000)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"Sort And Limit\", 3) { _ =>\r\n    withSQLConf(\"spark.sql.execution.topKSortFallbackThreshold\" -> \"-1\") {\r\n      spark.range(N).toDF(\"c\").repartition(200).sort(\"c\").take(200000)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"Sort\", 3) { _ =>\r\n    spark.range(N).toDF(\"c\").repartition(200).sort(\"c\").collect()\r\n  }\r\n  benchmark.run()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the result is \r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_191-b12 on Mac OS X 10.15.6\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz\r\nbenchmark sort and limit:                 Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTakeOrderedAndProject                              1833           2259         382          0.1       18327.1       1.0X\r\nSort And Limit                                     1417           1658         285          0.1       14167.5       1.3X\r\nSort                                               1324           1484         225          0.1       13238.3       1.4X\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt shows that it makes sense to replace `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` with `Sort + Project`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use current timestamp with warning log when the issue date for token is not set up properly. The next section will explain the rationalization with details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately not every implementations respect the `issue date` in `AbstractDelegationTokenIdentifier`, which Spark relies on while calculating. The default value of issue date is 0L, which is far from actual issue date, breaking logic on calculating next renewal date under some circumstance, leading to 0 interval (immediate) on rescheduling token renewal.\r\n\r\nIn HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider, Spark calculates token renewal interval as below:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2c64b731ae6a976b0d75a95901db849b4a0e2393/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/security/HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.scala#L123-L134\r\n\r\nThe interval is calculated as `token.renew() - identifier.getIssueDate`, which is providing correct interval assuming both `token.renew()` and `identifier.getIssueDate` produce correct value, but it's going to be weird when `identifier.getIssueDate` provides 0L (default value), like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/10/13 06:34:19 INFO security.HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider: Renewal interval is 1603175657000 for token S3ADelegationToken/IDBroker\r\n20/10/13 06:34:19 INFO security.HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider: Renewal interval is 86400048 for token HDFS_DELEGATION_TOKEN\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully we pick the minimum value as safety guard (so in this case, `86400048` is being picked up), but the safety guard leads unintentional bad impact on this case.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2c64b731ae6a976b0d75a95901db849b4a0e2393/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/security/HadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.scala#L58-L71\r\n\r\nSpark leverages the interval being calculated in above, \"minimum\" value of intervals, and blindly adds the value to token's issue date to calculates the next renewal date for the token, and picks \"minimum\" value again. In problematic case, the value would be `86400048` (86400048 + 0) which is quite smaller than current timestamp.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2c64b731ae6a976b0d75a95901db849b4a0e2393/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/security/HadoopDelegationTokenManager.scala#L228-L234\r\n\r\nThe next renewal date is subtracted with current timestamp again to get the interval, and multiplexed by configured ratio to produce the final schedule interval. In problematic case, this value goes to negative.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2c64b731ae6a976b0d75a95901db849b4a0e2393/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/security/HadoopDelegationTokenManager.scala#L180-L188\r\n\r\nThere's a safety guard to not allow negative value, but that's simply 0 meaning schedule immediately. This triggers next calculation of next renewal date to calculate the schedule interval, lead to the same behavior, hence updating delegation token immediately and continuously.\r\n\r\nAs we fetch token just before the calculation happens, the actual issue date is likely slightly before, hence it's not that dangerous to use current timestamp as issue date for the token the issue date has not been set up properly. Still, it's better not to leave the token implementation as it is, so we log warn message to let end users consult with token implementer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRevert code that does not use passed-in SparkSession to get SQLConf in [SPARK-33140]. The change scope of [SPARK-33140] change passed-in SQLConf instance and place using SparkSession to get SQLConf to be unified to use SQLConf.get. And the code reverted in the patch, the passed-in SparkSession was not about to get SQLConf, but using its catalog, it's better to be consistent.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPotential regression bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Spark, `set -v` is defined as \"Queries all properties that are defined in the SQLConf of the sparkSession\".\r\nBut there are other external modules that also define properties and register them to SQLConf. In this case,\r\nit can't be displayed by `set -v` until the conf object is initiated (i.e. calling the object at least once).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to eagerly initiate all the objects registered to SQLConf, so that `set -v` will always output\r\nthe completed properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the `set -v` command to produces completed and  deterministic results\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n`set -v` command will dump more configs\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBackport [SPARK-33339](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30248) fix to branch-2.4\r\n\r\nWhen a system.exit exception occurs during the process, the python worker exits abnormally, and then the executor task is still waiting for the worker for reading from socket, causing it to hang.\r\nThe system.exit exception may be caused by the user's error code, but spark should at least throw an error to remind the user, not get stuck\r\nwe can run a simple test to reproduce this case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\ndef err(line):\r\n  raise SystemExit\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"test\").getOrCreate()\r\nspark.sparkContext.parallelize(range(1,2), 2).map(err).collect()\r\nspark.stop()\r\n``` \r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a backport for PR #30359.\r\n\r\nThis changes `RefreshTableExec` in DSv2 to also invalidate caches with references to the target table to be refreshed. The change itself is similar to what's done in #30211. Note that though, since we currently don't support caching a DSv2 table directly, this doesn't add recache logic as in the DSv1 impl. I marked it as a TODO for now.\r\n\r\nNote there is some conflicts in the backport: in branch-3.0 `DataSourceV2Strategy` we don't have a `ResolvedTable` when analyzing `RefreshTable` so instead in `RefreshTableExec` this loads the table from the catalog if it exists, and the rest is the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the behavior in DSv1 and DSv2 is inconsistent w.r.t refreshing table: in DSv1 we invalidate both metadata cache as well as all table caches that are related to the table, but in DSv2 we only do the former. This addresses the issue and make the behavior consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now refreshing a v2 table also invalidate all the related caches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes `RefreshTableExec` in DSv2 to also invalidate caches with references to the target table to be refreshed. The change itself is similar to what's done in #30211. Note that though, since we currently don't support caching a DSv2 table directly, this doesn't add recache logic as in the DSv1 impl. I marked it as a TODO for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the behavior in DSv1 and DSv2 is inconsistent w.r.t refreshing table: in DSv1 we invalidate both metadata cache as well as all table caches that are related to the table, but in DSv2 we only do the former. This addresses the issue and make the behavior consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now refreshing a v2 table also invalidate all the related caches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThrow `NoSuchNamespaceException` in `listTables()` of the custom test catalog `InMemoryTableCatalog` if the passed namespace doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To align behavior of V2 `InMemoryTableCatalog` to V1 session catalog.\r\n2. To distinguish two situations:\r\n    1. A namespace **does exist** but does not contain any tables. In that case, `listTables()` returns empty result.\r\n    2. A namespace **does not exist**. `listTables()` throws `NoSuchNamespaceException` in this case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. For example, `SHOW TABLES` returns empty result before the changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running V1/V2 ShowTablesSuites.","created_at":"2020-11-12T18:09:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-19T15:03:33Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T07:08:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a59bf0cdd41ce18ac9e10a46227cda4c664f2d80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef2f5d2b0417e530da3def8e776971d39dd8df0e","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:show-tables-in-not-existing-namespace","ref":"show-tables-in-not-existing-namespace","sha":"ef2f5d2b0417e530da3def8e776971d39dd8df0e","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes SQL parser using active SQLConf instead of the one in ctor-parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn ANSI mode, schema string parsing should fail if the schema uses ANSI reserved keyword as attribute name:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", \"true\")\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"26/10/2015\"}', 'time Timestamp', map('timestampFormat',  'dd/MM/yyyy'));\"\"\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n\r\n> Cannot parse the data type: \r\n> no viable alternative at input 'time'(line 1, pos 0)\r\n> \r\n> == SQL ==\r\n> time Timestamp\r\n> ^^^\r\n\r\nBut this query may accidentally succeed in certain cases cause the DataType parser sticks to the configs of the first created session in the current thread:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nDataType.fromDDL(\"time Timestamp\")\r\nval newSpark = spark.newSession()\r\nnewSpark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", \"true\")\r\nnewSpark.sql(\"\"\"select from_json('{\"time\":\"26/10/2015\"}', 'time Timestamp', map('timestampFormat', 'dd/MM/yyyy'));\"\"\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n\r\n>

+--------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNewly and updated

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI push this PR as I could not re-open the stale one https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20665 .\r\n\r\nAs for Yarn or Kubernetes, Mesos users should be able to specify priority queues to define a workload management policy for queued drivers in the Mesos Cluster Dispatcher.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure scheduling order while enqueuing Spark applications for a Mesos cluster.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, submitted drivers are kept in order of their submission: the first driver added to the queue will be the first one to be executed (FIFO), regardless of their priority.\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-23499 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe MesosClusterDispatcher UI shows now Spark jobs along with the queue to which they are submitted.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\nAlso, this feature has been in production for 3 years now as we use a modified Spark 2.4.0 since then.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-12T10:50:40Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T08:19:26Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T00:54:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eddca60eaeb51beb1309b46e671a0d7ac64db694","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up fix for the failing tests in `YarnShuffleServiceSuite.java`. This java class was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30062. The tests in the class fail when run with hadoop-2.7 profile:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] testCreateDefaultMergedShuffleFileManagerInstance(org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite)  Time elapsed: 0.627 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite.testCreateDefaultMergedShuffleFileManagerInstance(YarnShuffleServiceSuite.java:37)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite.testCreateDefaultMergedShuffleFileManagerInstance(YarnShuffleServiceSuite.java:37)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testCreateRemoteBlockPushResolverInstance(org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite)  Time elapsed: 0 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleService\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite.testCreateRemoteBlockPushResolverInstance(YarnShuffleServiceSuite.java:47)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testInvalidClassNameOfMergeManagerWillUseNoOpInstance(org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite)  Time elapsed: 0.001 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleService\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite.testInvalidClassNameOfMergeManagerWillUseNoOpInstance(YarnShuffleServiceSuite.java:57)\r\n```\r\nA test suit for `YarnShuffleService` did exist here:\r\n`resource-managers/yarn/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleServiceSuite.scala`\r\nI missed this when I created `common/network-yarn/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/network/yarn/YarnShuffleServiceSuite.java`. Moving all the new tests to the earlier test suite fixes the failures with hadoop-2.7 even though why this happened is not clear.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe newly added tests are failing when run with hadoop profile 2.7\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the unit tests with the default profile as well as hadoop 2.7 profile.\r\n`build/mvn test -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.network.yarn.YarnShuffleServiceSuite -Phadoop-2.7 -Pyarn`\r\n```\r\nRun starting. Expected test count is: 11\r\nYarnShuffleServiceSuite:\r\n- executor state kept across NM restart\r\n- removed applications should not be in registered executor file\r\n- shuffle service should be robust to corrupt registered executor file\r\n- get correct recovery path\r\n- moving recovery file from NM local dir to recovery path\r\n- service throws error if cannot start\r\n- recovery db should not be created if NM recovery is not enabled\r\n- SPARK-31646: metrics should be registered into Node Manager's metrics system\r\n- create default merged shuffle file manager instance\r\n- create remote block push resolver instance\r\n- invalid class name of merge manager will use noop instance\r\nRun completed in 2 seconds, 572 milliseconds.\r\nTotal number of tests run: 11\r\nSuites: completed 2, aborted 0\r\nTests: succeeded 11, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0\r\nAll tests passed.\r\n```","created_at":"2020-11-12T08:39:34Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T04:03:08Z","closed_at":"2020-11-13T22:17:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0496009a09180137d1ab2c6df838e818800cd4d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c11f583174d0309637f4daee9c25e2d2a76278e1","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-32916-followup","ref":"SPARK-32916-followup","sha":"c11f583174d0309637f4daee9c25e2d2a76278e1","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

SparkUI doesn't work when use an external reverse proxy\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the compute URL when use an external reverse proxy. SparkUI/Executors make an API call but the URL is wrong and don't use existing (only use the domain).\r\nThis PR add a new way to compute this URL using the total URL and removing the last part (eg. \"executors/\") in order to keep using the full URL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe can use the SparkUI under an external reverse proxy (HTML and other static files already works, just missing API calls)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo tests are made for JS files on this project.","created_at":"2020-11-12T08:36:40Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T00:45:38Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T00:45:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ccf9d49c600227cc5610fd6e4378019b6514b64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54c225c5b850cb3054e474053600621533a4a50b","head":{"label":"PierreLeresteux:33413-sparkui-reverseproxy","ref":"33413-sparkui-reverseproxy","sha":"54c225c5b850cb3054e474053600621533a4a50b","user":{"login":"PierreLeresteux","id":1528922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjg5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux","html_url":"https://github.com/PierreLeresteux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311722445,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTE3MjI0NDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"PierreLeresteux/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PierreLeresteux","id":1528922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mjg5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1528922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux","html_url":"https://github.com/PierreLeresteux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierreLeresteux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PierreLeresteux/spark","description":"Apache
