io.oden/embedded-redis artifact was provided by me as part of\r\nlanding BEAM-13159, as the previously used version did not use a recent\r\nenough version of Redis to support the XADD/XRANGE command set and also\r\nhad a fatal crash bug on darwin/arm64 (\"Apple Silicon\").\r\n\r\nMy fork in turn was based on the signal.org artifact, which had a more\r\nrecent redis version but was still affected by the crash bug.  Now that\r\nhttps://github.com/signalapp/embedded-redis/pull/12 has landed, the\r\nio.oden artifact is unlikely to be upgraded further; beam should use the\r\ndependency that is actively maintained.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a continuation of the work started in #16776\r\n\r\nRight now, when we have an iter/reiter/multimap function that uses a nested type with a non-concrete type somewhere in it, we don't give a very

is technically a breaking change, but I think it's a safe one as I don't expect many people are overriding `DoFn.infer_output_type`. I looked for instances of this in internal Google code, and there's only one such case. Funnily enough, it actually respects _this_ proposed API, and returns the element type, not `Iterable[element_type]`.  This is also true for the place we override it in `apache_beam.dataframe.schemas`, previously that code had a workaround to deal with the improper handling, which can now be removed.\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master branch)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Lang</th>\r\n

now, when we have an emit function that takes in a nested type with a non-concrete type somewhere in it, we don't give a very clear error - e.g., if we tried to define the following pardo:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype nestedEmitType struct {\r\n\tGhi func(string) string\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype emitType struct {\r\n\tAbc string\r\n\tDef nestedEmitType\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (f *extractFn) ProcessElement(ctx context.Context, line string, emit func(emitType)) {\r\n   ... Do stuff ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nright now we get this error\r\n\r\n```\r\npanic: \tinserting ParDo in scope root/CountWords\r\n\tconstructing DoFn\r\ninvalid DoFn\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nmethod ProcessElement invalid\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nbad parameter type for reflect.methodValueCall: func(main.emitType)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis updates to give a much clearer error - e.g. for the same case with these changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\npanic: \tinserting ParDo in scope root/CountWords\r\n\tconstructing DoFn\r\ninvalid DoFn\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nmethod ProcessElement invalid\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nbad parameter type for reflect.methodValueCall: func(main.emitType)\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nAll parameters in an emit must be universal type, container type, or concrete type\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nNested type in struct \"main.emitType\" not permitted in concrete types.\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nNested type in struct \"main.nestedEmitType\" not permitted in concrete types.\r\n\tcaused by:\r\nType \"func(string) string\" of kind \"func\" not permitted in concrete types. All types must be serializable.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the name of small prs/quick feedback, I decided to put this up before handling similar cases for Iter/ReIter/MultiMap (right now just represented as a TODO), once this is in I'll apply a similar approach to them.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

gets a basic schema representation started to the SBE extension. It focuses on IR, since it's easier to work with and is in the most immediate need.\r\n\r\nIt's technically possible to generate a Beam schema and `PayloadSerializer` from this, but I'm saving that for a future PR. Otherwise, this works with very simple schemas.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't translate directly to a Beam schema, since using an IR doesn't support encoding (i.e. there's an `OtfDecoder` but no `OtfEncoder`, which is understandable). If we ever get a request to do SBE encoding from an IR, we'll need to implement it ourselves, so this is set up to easily start tracking additional info if it ever comes to that.\r\n\r\nThe decision was also made to let users set how to handle unsigned types, which is a deviation from the original plan, but I don't think it was ever firmly established if forcing a higher bit count was acceptable.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

new client builder factory makes all existing provider APIs obsolete, these are in fact now implemented in terms of the new factory. Respective old APIs got deprecated.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n- User facing APIs become independent of what client types are used (e.g. additional Cloudwatch integration, async or sync, ...)\r\n- Respects existing AwsOptions (regions, credentials, proxy, http config, ...) if set, but users may always configure AWS IOs individually.\r\n- A retry configuration is pushed down into the AWS client via the factory ([BEAM-13206])\r\n- Finally consistent configuration options between all AWS IOs, including the S3FileSystem.\r\n- If needed, the factory class can be changed using AwsOptions to allow for a custom implementation.\r\n- One well tested place supporting the various possible configuration options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`ProcessContext#outputWithTimestamp` is more fragile than `output`, and explicit use of `outputWithTimestamp` is not required in the case of ES module; in fact, code is currently trying to emulate `output` by storing and recalling element timestamps.

Integrates the DataprocClusterManager previously introduced in: \r\n  - [[BEAM-13799] Create an Interactive Beam Dataproc package for users to manage clusters with](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16691)\r\n- Adds code to automatically create a Dataproc cluster configured with Docker and Flink if a user instantiates an InteractiveRunner using underlying_runner='FlinkRunner'\r\n- By default, the created Dataproc cluster will be called 'interactive-beam-cluster' and will be cleaned up when the Interactive Environment is interrupted\r\n- Introduces the Clusters class in interactive_beam.py, which acts as a user interface that provides the user with the following capabilities:\r\n  - Changing the default name of the clusters created by Interactive Beam\r\n  - Cleaning up a cluster by providing a corresponding pipeline, an option to force the deletion is provided, in the case where more than one pipeline use the same cluster\r\n  - Getting all pipelines that use the provided master_url\r\n  - Receiving a description back for either the cluster corresponding to a specific pipeline, or the descriptions of all pipelines\r\n- ASF

now stale bot is not running correctly - it looks like it stopped working around a year ago (last pr I could find with stale bot activity). I'm guessing this was unintentional and caused by probot not being supported anymore, just like the pr labeler (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13779)\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this breakage, we have a lot of stale prs that have been around for a while. As of the writing of this issue, we have 218 prs in the repo, with 129 older than 60 days old (59% stale assuming these don't have more recent activity). This makes the repo feel less active and makes it harder to see the legitimate PRs that have fallen through the cracks. This fixes the problem by adding the GitHub stale action \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

away from older version of Go Worker Binary, in favour of a dedicated RoleUrn.\r\n\r\n1. Adds \"beam:artifact:role:go_worker_binary:v1\" urn to proto.\r\n2. On pipeline execution, updates the default Go env in the pipeline proto with the worker binary, as appropriate:\r\n  * Continue to use file references for universal runners\r\n  * Start using URL types pointing to GCS staging location for Dataflow.\r\n3. Retain legacy logic in case of old SDKs using newer SDK container for some reason.\r\n4. Newer SDKs can still use older SDK containers as there's no simple mechanism at present to add additional dependencies to the Go environment. Therefore there's often only 1 dependency and it will always be the worker. However, from 2.37.0 on, the role will be usable and expected.\r\n\r\nValidated \"old container\" behavior manually against Spark and Dataflow, with the pipelines successfully executing with each.\r\n\r\nMinor breaking change to the dataflow lib, unexporting the StageFile function, and also have it return the SHA256 hash for the binary. dataflowlib was never intended to be used outside of the dataflow runner code anyway.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

documentation for SnowflakeIO has some bugs and it does not describe a few things very well. I would like to make the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Fix code examples (!!)\r\n- Add information about the need to add a maven package.\r\n- Add links to other resources i.e. SnowflakeIO source code, SnowflakeIO Javadoc/pydoc, Snowflake docs\r\n- Describe more precisely the `Snowflake.DataSourceConfiguration` object configuration for the different authentication methods.\r\n- Add section about current limitations\r\n- Improve file syntax\r\nIn the coming weeks, I will want to introduce more changes, but current changes seem crucial to me.\r\n- I also had to turn off syntax highlighting as a temporary workaround as this guide does not yet follow the projects convention. We have separate documentation for Python and Java, which causes the code blocks to not display properly. I will be hardening the Python SDK in the near future and then I will also improve the documentation structure.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to this project, so if I did something inconsistent with the adopted process, I will be happy to hear about it.\r\n\r\nPS. Can I ask for io-python-snowflake component in JIRA?\r\n\r\nInternal tracker: SNOW-539549\r\n\r\nR: @sfc-gh-pgancz, @sfc-gh-takidau, @takidau, @melap\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, in the Go Sdk the Google Cloud Dataflow runner automatically populates PipelineOptions with a subset of the Command Line flags that a user passes in when running a pipeline, but all other runners do not. This document proposes unifying Go runners’ treatment of PipelineOptions so that by default each runner will populate PipelineOptions with all Command Line flags. We will still give each runner the ability to mask some subset of those flags.\r\n\r\nFull design doc here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyO5SDEd_DzyOyrz_TkyDLUv19eLsKI97vKM8I7fQ9o/edit#heading=h.wskna8eurvjv\r\n\r\nFor manual testing beyond the automated one I added, I ran this on the direct/dataflow/universal runners with a pipeline that just prints out the PipelineOptions key/values\r\n\r\n**Direct runner**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/152418756-ec8edc28-f6c7-42af-a48c-a91044a3954d.png)\r\n\r\n**Spark (universal) runner**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/152418853-5269858f-7e96-4dac-ab0d-af8cd481c0ec.png)\r\n\r\n**Dataflow PipelineOptions in the console**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42773683/152418918-0d1bf9c7-cd40-4504-833a-d0b4e0409bab.png)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
