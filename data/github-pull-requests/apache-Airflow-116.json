PR displays only the running configuration in the configurations view. The (very confusing) default configuration is not displayed anymore. I regularly encounter confusion among Airflow users on this page about what is actually the running value of a config option, because it's not obvious you first have to scroll past the default configuration.\r\n\r\nThis follows up on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/14641, which went stale.\r\n\r\nThere's an undocumented `/configuration?raw=true` endpoint to download the config. Users should use the `/config` endpoint in the REST API instead. I can't imagine anybody using this `raw=true` endpoint, but added a `Deprecation` header to the response to indicate the upcoming removal. If there's a better way to indicate deprecation, please let me know.\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n`AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=True`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/212119222-afc107c5-d072-44a6-ac8c-f6e2b118112d.png)\r\n\r\n`AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=False`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/212119696-f75e1c96-785f-4436-a810-f98c8e11c7f7.png)\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n`AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=True`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/212120866-9dc82ebf-000c-4e02-9543-81a85919efee.png)\r\n\r\n`AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=False`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/212120219-c085d110-5f01-4dcd-8c60-ce54815acb76.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^

#27146\r\n\r\nCurrently users can connect to both single-tenant and multi-tenant instances of dbt Cloud. However, for the enterprise tier, [there is a new region offered as well as private instance support](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/regions-ip-addresses). The existing `tenant` value does not cover the ability to modify the entire domain name which could be required for users on the enterprise plan.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement allows users to specify the tenant domain they wish to connect to while keeping the \"cloud.getdbt.com\" domain as the default. Additionally, backward compat is implemented for those who are only specifying the third-level domain for single-tenant instances and wish to upgrade the provider version.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

needed.","created_at":"2023-01-12T00:44:55Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T23:00:09Z","closed_at":"2023-03-03T22:59:48Z","merged_at":"2023-03-03T22:59:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"2cebdc5007f90b42937b2a0346f3c727dc36e131","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

a `deferrable` param in RedshiftPauseClusterOperator. This will help to run `RedshiftPauseClusterOperator` operator in async/deferrable mode.\r\n\r\nCurrently, AWS does not maintain the async version of boto3 so I need to depend on [aiobotcore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore) an async version for AWS botocore. Unfortunately, `aiobotocore` depend on [botocore>=1.27.59,<1.27.60](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore/blob/master/setup.py#L10) while boto3 depend on [botocore>=1.29.78,<1.30.0](https://github.com/boto/boto3/blob/develop/setup.py#L16) and boto3 is core dependency in our provider so we can not add `aiobotcore` in core dependency.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'm adding `aiobotocore` as an additional dependency until https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore/issues/976 has been resolved.\r\n\r\nI'm adding `AwsBaseAsyncHook` a basic async AWS  hook. This will at present support the default `botocore` auth i'e if airflow connection is not provided then auth using ENV and if airflow connection is provided then basic auth with secret-key/access-key-id/profile/token and arn-method. maybe we can support the other auth incrementally depending on the community interest. \r\n\r\nBecause the dependency making things a little bit complicated so I have created a new test module `deferrable` inside AWS provider tests and I'm keeping the async-related test in this particular module. I have also added a new CI job to test/run the AWS deferable operator tests and I'm ignoring the deferable tests in other CI job test runs.\r\n\r\nAdd a trigger class which will wait until the Redshift pause request reaches a terminal state i.e paused or fail, We also have retry logic like the sync operator.\r\n\r\nThis PR donates the following developed RedshiftPauseClusterOperatorAsync` in [astronomer-providers](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers) repo to apache airflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

can be tough to get right. Typically someone would like to allow any classes below 'mymodule' to match. For example, 'mymodule.dataclasses' by setting allowed_deserialization_classes to 'mymodule.*'. However this matches everything starting with mymodule, so also mymodulemalicious. This change replaces bare '.' with '\\..' so it matches the literal '.' as well.\r\n\r\n@kaxil \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds the option to wait for completion with the EmrCreateJobFlowOperator. It includes:\r\n\r\n* The implementation of a `waiter` to wait for WAITING or TERMINATED state.\r\n* To avoid breaking changes, the default is set to `wait_for_completion=False`. This matches the current behavior and will start a job flow and immediately succeed the Airflow task.\r\n* A few consistency fixes here and there. AWS writes \"job flow\" (lowercase) so I adhered to that.\r\n* Also implemented an `on_kill` method. Moved EMR hook creation & caching to a `cached_property` because the hook is called from multiple methods.\r\n* I don't think a default max. runtime of 25 minutes is desirable, I've had many projects which ran EMR jobs longer than that. I allowed `None` for the `waiter.countdown` argument type to represent waiting for infinity (or until the Airflow task times out based on `execution_timeout`). Defaulted the `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator.waiter_countdown` to `None`. Checked all other usages of `waiter_countdown` and they all default to `25 * 60` so no breaking changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Sync and Persistence for DAGs makes very little sense together and is largely misleading our users on what it does.\r\n\r\nGit Sync provides atomicity of DAG folder synchronisation via checking out a complete copy of the DAGs folder and swapping symbolic link pointing to it. It does not play well with networked persistence.\r\n\r\nIt makes it super-easy by users unaware how git-sync and persistence work under-the-hood to walk into several traps:\r\n\r\n* git sync on persistent remote volumes such as EFS generate a LOT of extra traffic due to the way how git sync works (it creates second working folder for dags and replaces symbolic link to folders which effectively forces full sync of whole DAG folder for all involved instances with every commit\r\n* due to that sync that gets distributed over multiple clients of persistent volumes it looses the atomicity property of git sync and the above case where there are burst of synchronisation betwween multiple nodes, it is very likely to trigger inconsistent DAG parsing\r\n* the problem amplifies when the network volumes are distributed among multiple nodes and there are some networking limits (for example not provisioned IOPS in EFS). The amount of traffic generated at sync might cause even more inconsistencies - only solvable by paying extra IOPS (where it would not be needed normally)\r\n* users might be tricked into trying to use gitSync and also update DAGs using persistence (so basically combine the development friendly dag distribution over persistent volumes and production-ready git-sync - without being aware that git-sync will override the manually synced DAGS when swapping the symbolic links\r\n\r\nOn top of it, the current status is that it does not work. There are several issues where volumes are missing when the combo is used in certain situations and better than fixing those is to disable it.\r\n\r\nCloses: #27545\r\nCloses: #27476\r\nCloses: #27080\r\n\r\nRelated: #27124\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change is to move local_infile parameter from connection extra to Hook. Since this feature is only used for very specific cases, it belongs to the \"action\" it executes not to the connection defined in general. For example in Hive and Vertica transfers, the capability of local_inline is simply exnabled by bulk_load parameter - and it allows to use the same connection in both cases.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`BeamRunGoPipelineOperator` currently has a `go_file` parameter, which represents the path to a Go source file with the pipeline code. The operator starts the pipeline with `go run`, i.e. compiles the code into a temporary binary and executes.  \r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the operator to start the pipeline with an already compiled binary, as an alternative to the source file approach. It introduces two new parameters:\r\n1. `launcher_binary` path to a binary compiled for the launching platform, i.e. the platform where Airflow is deployed\r\n2. `worker_binary` (optional) path to a binary compiled for the worker platform if using a remote runner\r\n\r\nSome motivations to introduce this feature:\r\n- It does not require a Go installation on the system where Airflow is run (which is more similar to how the `BeamRunJavaPipelineOperator` works, running a jar)\r\n- It does not involve the extra steps of initializing a Go module, installing dependences and compiling the code every task run, which is what currently happens when the Go source file is downloaded from GCS\r\n- In the current implementation only a single Go source file can downloaded from GCS. This can be limiting if the project comprises multiple

received a number of requests to upgrade individual dependencies in the constraint files (mostly due to those dependencies releasing version with vulnerabilities fixed).

that timetables vary across multiple dimensions, I believe they are a good candidate for composition over inheritance. For instance, the CronTriggerTimetable is great, but it's easy to imagine wanting a variety of different data intervals other than a fixed timedelta, and that will quickly lead to subclass explosion.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to make that an option. There is a significant constraint in that all Timetable classes must be either plugins or part of Airflow proper, and they have to be serializable.","created_at":"2023-01-05T23:04:57Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T00:14:54Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T00:14:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c72d4e941d65820336bbc12ddfb174e777ee7b62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

#28741.\r\n\r\nOur custom JSON encoders call `serialize()` in their `default()` hooks. However, `serialize()` does not guarantee to return a JSON-serializable type, and when it does not (e.g. a set object), the JSON encoder would infinitely recurse into `serialize()` trying to coerce the object into JSON-serializable.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an additional `ensure_json_compatible` parameter to `serialize()`, so JSON encoders can use it to require `serialize()` to always return JSON-compatible values.\r\n\r\nSome minor refactoring is also applied to `serialize()` to ensure the flag is correctly passed down through recursive visits, and also hide the `depth` tracking parameter (which is internal to the function) from outside access.\r\n\r\nThe `_reverse_cache` global variable is also deleted since it is not used anywhere, even before this patch.","created_at":"2023-01-05T12:08:43Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T13:22:26Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T00:55:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9b598e6ac3cf29f84fbc6c927241dbd0e23e7a9","assignee":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769805151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5ODA1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:serialization","name":"area:serialization","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

As v4 is the only version that is currently supported, we should update the sensor to work well with these changes.\r\n\r\nCurrently, sensor only checks if file status is different from `PROCESSING`. As You can see in the official [documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/rest/v4/File#status) there is a status called `QUEUED` which also means that the report file is not yet picked up for processing. From my experience this status can be returned when API is globally under heavy load or if You are generating multiple reports at once as a single user. Right now sensor exits when finding QUEUED status: \r\n<img width=\"438\" alt=\"image\"
