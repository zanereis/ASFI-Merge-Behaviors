What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Current TreeNode string representation APIs\r\n\r\n* `nodeName`: the name of this node, default to the class name.\r\n* `stringArgs`: the iterator of the arguments\r\n* `argString`: a string representing the arguments to this node, minus any children.\r\n* `simpleString`: ONE line description, including `argString`.\r\n* `verboseString`: ONE line description with more info. No default impl. in `TreeNode`.\r\n* `verboseStringWithSuffix`: `verboseString` with additional suffix, currently the only suffix is the statistics of logical plan\r\n* `toString`: `treeString(verbose = true)`\r\n* `treeString(verbose: Boolean)`: tree string representation of nodes in this tree. If `verbose` is true, call `simpleString` for each node, else call `verboseString`.\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nCurrently we have a lot of string representations for `QueryPlan`/`Expression`: `toString`, `simpleString`, `verboseString`, `treeString`, etc.\r\n\r\nThe logic between them is not very clear. We make `simpleString` too verbose by including too much information and make `verboseString` very similar to `toString`.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious problem now is that, `Expression.treeString` is mostly unreadable as it contains a lot duplicated information.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThis patch cleans the few interfaces up as:\r\n\r\n* `simpleString`: no arguments info; ONE line string representation\r\n* `verboseString`: all arguments info minus any children; ONE line string representation\r\n* `treeString`: all nodes in this tree, if `verbose == true`, calling  `verboseString` for each node, otherwise `simpleString`; TREE string representation\r\n* `toString`: all nodes in this tree;  (`Expression`) ONE line string representation; (`QueryPlan`) TREE string representation\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\nFor the following deserializer:\r\n\r\n    val encoder = ExpressionEncoder.tuple(\r\n      ExpressionEncoder[StringLongClass],\r\n      ExpressionEncoder[Long])\r\n    val attrs = Seq('a.struct('a.string, 'b.byte), 'b.int)\r\n    encoder.resolveAndBind(attrs).fromRow(InternalRow(InternalRow(str, 1.toByte), 2))\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, the output of `treeString` looks like:\r\n\r\n        newInstance(class scala.Tuple2)\r\n        :- if (isnull(input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true])) null else newInstance(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.StringLongClass)\r\n        :  :- isnull(input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true])\r\n        :  :  +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true]\r\n        :  :- null\r\n        :  +- newInstance(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.StringLongClass)\r\n        :     :- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true].a.toString\r\n        :     :  +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true].a\r\n        :     :     +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true]\r\n        :     +- assertnotnull(cast(input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true].b as bigint), - field (class: \"scala.Long\", name: \"b\"), - root class: \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.StringLongClass\")\r\n        :        +- cast(input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true].b as bigint)\r\n        :           +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true].b\r\n        :              +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true]\r\n        +- cast(input[1, int, true] as bigint)\r\n           +- input[1, int, true]\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, the output of `treeString` looks like:\r\n\r\n        newInstance(class scala.Tuple2)\r\n        :- if\r\n        :  :- isnull\r\n        :  :  +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true]\r\n        :  :- null\r\n        :  +- newInstance(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.StringLongClass)\r\n        :     :- invoke(toString)\r\n        :     :  +- getstructfield(a)\r\n        :     :     +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true]\r\n        :     +- assertnotnull([- field (class: \"scala.Long\", name: \"b\"), - root class: \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.enco\r\n        ders.StringLongClass\"])\r\n        :        +- cast to bigint\r\n        :           +- getstructfield(b)\r\n        :              +- input[0, struct<a:string,b:tinyint>, true]\r\n        +- cast to bigint\r\n           +- input[1, int, true]\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHadoop FileSystem's statistics in based on thread local variables, this is ok if the RDD computation chain is running in the same thread. But if child RDD creates another thread to consume the iterator got from Hadoop RDDs, the bytesRead computation will be error, because now the iterator's `next()` and `close()` may run in different threads. This could be happened when using PySpark with PythonRDD.\r\n\r\nSo here building a map to track the `bytesRead` for different thread and add them together. This method will be used in three RDDs, `HadoopRDD`, `NewHadoopRDD` and `FileScanRDD`. I assume `FileScanRDD` cannot be called directly, so I only fixed `HadoopRDD` and `NewHadoopRDD`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and local cluster verification.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-12T06:33:57Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T19:48:22Z","closed_at":"2017-06-01T05:38:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f0be1c513fac5fb70aae2c9ee2504442995f4db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c068f434db53408aa9650e7a23edcf7af3b9ecc5","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-20244","ref":"SPARK-20244","sha":"c068f434db53408aa9650e7a23edcf7af3b9ecc5","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSession catalog API `createTempFunction` is being used by Hive build-in functions, persistent functions, and temporary functions. Thus, the name is confusing. This PR is to rename it by `registerFunction`. Also we can move construction of `FunctionBuilder` and `ExpressionInfo` into the new `registerFunction`, instead of duplicating the logics everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn the next PRs, the remaining Function-related APIs also need cleanups. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test cases.","created_at":"2017-04-12T05:32:57Z","updated_at":"2017-04-12T16:04:15Z","closed_at":"2017-04-12T16:04:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3bc04166d7bb1677917bc8e8479a8f4d008811a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e876af1882a53fcd5569594e9ea486dba66850b4","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:cleanupCreateTempFunction","ref":"cleanupCreateTempFunction","sha":"e876af1882a53fcd5569594e9ea486dba66850b4","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDataset typed API currently uses NewInstance to box primitive types (i.e. calling the constructor). Instead, it'd be slightly more idiomatic in Java to use PrimitiveType.valueOf, which can be invoked using StaticInvoke expression.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe change should be covered by existing tests for Dataset encoders.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-11T08:22:59Z","updated_at":"2017-04-11T18:15:13Z","closed_at":"2017-04-11T18:15:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5fddf2008363069117f6ebd2e46b108d88ff10a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8cbc617ee528ab92a755995a03b9ebefc2eb03a4","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-20289","ref":"SPARK-20289","sha":"8cbc617ee528ab92a755995a03b9ebefc2eb03a4","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

[Jenkins](http://spark-tests.appspot.com/test-details?suite_name=org.apache.spark.network.RequestTimeoutIntegrationSuite&test_name=furtherRequestsDelay). The failure is because `callback1` may not be called before `assertTrue(callback1.failure instanceof IOException);`. It's pretty easy to reproduce this error by adding a sleep before this line: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/379b0b0bbdbba2278ce3bcf471bd75f6ffd9cf0d/common/network-common/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/network/RequestTimeoutIntegrationSuite.java#L267\r\n\r\nThe fix is straightforward: just use the latch to wait until `callback1` is called. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen sending accumulator updates back to driver, the network overhead is pretty big as there are a lot of accumulators, e.g. `TaskMetrics` will send about 20 accumulators everytime, there may be a lot of `SQLMetric` if the query plan is complicated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it's critical to reduce the size of serialized accumulator. A simple way is to not send the name of internal accumulators to executor side, as it's unnecessary. When executor sends accumulator updates back to driver, we can look up the accumulator name in `AccumulatorContext` easily. Note that, we still need to send names of normal accumulators, as the user code run at executor side may rely on accumulator names.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we should reimplement `TaskMetrics` to not rely on accumulators and use custom serialization.\r\n\r\nTried on the example in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12837, the size of serialized accumulator has been cut down by about 40%.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

This rule also looks affecting to the name of functions as written in the README.md.\r\n\r\n> `multiple_dots_linter`: check that function and variable names are separated by _ rather than ..\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested `./dev/lint-r`with the manual change below in `R/functions.R`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n setMethod(\"from_json\", signature(x = \"Column\", schema = \"structType\"),\r\n-          function(x, schema, asJsonArray = FALSE, ...) {\r\n+          function(x, schema, as.json.array = FALSE, ...) {\r\n             if (asJsonArray) {\r\n

Words within variable and function names should be separated by '_' rather than '.'.\r\n          function(x, schema, as.json.array = FALSE, ...) {\r\n                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```\r\nlintr checks

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent HistoryServer will display completed date of in-progress application as `1969-12-31 23:59:59`, which is not so meaningful. Instead of unnecessarily showing this incorrect completed date, here propose to make this column invisible for in-progress applications.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of only making this column invisible rather than deleting this field is that: this data is fetched through REST API, and in the REST API  the format is like below shows, in which `endTime` matches `endTimeEpoch`. So instead of changing REST API to break backward compatibility, here choosing a simple solution to only make this column invisible.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ {\r\n  \"id\" : \"local-1491805439678\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"Spark shell\",\r\n  \"attempts\" : [ {\r\n    \"startTime\" : \"2017-04-10T06:23:57.574GMT\",\r\n    \"endTime\" : \"1969-12-31T23:59:59.999GMT\",\r\n    \"lastUpdated\" : \"2017-04-10T06:23:57.574GMT\",\r\n    \"duration\" : 0,\r\n    \"sparkUser\" : \"\",\r\n    \"completed\" : false,\r\n    \"startTimeEpoch\" : 1491805437574,\r\n    \"endTimeEpoch\" : -1,\r\n    \"lastUpdatedEpoch\" : 1491805437574\r\n  } ]\r\n} ]%\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is UI before changed:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1317\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-10 at 3 45 57 pm\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJust to share some code I implemented to help easily create a custom Transformer in one line of code, \r\ne.g. ` val labelConverter = new FuncTransformer(udf { (i: Double) => if (i >= 1) 1 else 0 }) `\r\n\r\nOften I need some smaller or specific transformers to work with the real world data, and of course Spark.ml.feature can not suffice for all the scenarios. This was used in many of my projects and is pretty helpful (Maybe I'm lazy..) as it allows custom transformer in the minimum lines of code. The transformer can be saved/loaded as other transformer and can be integrated into a pipeline normally. It can be used widely in many use cases like conditional conversion(if...else...), , type conversion, to/from Array, to/from Vector and many string ops.\r\n\r\nCompared to `UnaryTransformer`, [(check the example)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39e2bad6a866d27c3ca594d15e574a1da3ee84cc/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/ml/UnaryTransformerExample.scala#L56), FuncTransformer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent SHS (Spark History Server) two different ACLs:\r\n\r\n* ACL of base URL, it is controlled by \"spark.acls.enabled\" or \"spark.ui.acls.enabled\", and with this enabled, only user configured with \"spark.admin.acls\" (or group) or \"spark.ui.view.acls\" (or group), or the user who started SHS could list all the applications, otherwise none of them can be listed. This will also affect REST APIs which listing the summary of all apps and one app.\r\n* Per application ACL. This is controlled by \"spark.history.ui.acls.enabled\". With this enabled only history admin user and user/group who ran this app can access the details of this app.\r\n\r\nWith this two ACLs, we may encounter several unexpected behaviors:\r\n\r\n1. if base URL's ACL (`spark.acls.enable`) is enabled but user A has no view permission. User \"A\" cannot see the app list but could still access details of it's own app.\r\n2. if ACLs of base URL (`spark.acls.enable`) is disabled, then user \"A\" could download any application's event log, even it is not run by user \"A\".\r\n3. The changes of Live UI's ACL will affect History UI's ACL which share the same conf file.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected behaviors is mainly because we have two different ACLs, ideally we should have only one to manage all.\r\n\r\nSo to improve SHS's ACL mechanism, here in this PR proposed to:\r\n\r\n1. Disable \"spark.acls.enable\" and only use \"spark.history.ui.acls.enable\" for history server.\r\n2. Check permission for event-log download REST API.\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Admin user could see/download the list of all applications, as well as application details.\r\n2. Normal user could see the list of all applications, but can only download and check the details of applications accessible to him.\r\n \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs are added, also verified in real cluster.\r\n\r\nCC @tgravescs @vanzin please help to review, this PR changes the semantics you did previously. Thanks a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis bug was partially addressed in SPARK-18555 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15994, but the root cause isn't completely solved. This bug is pretty critical since it changes the member id in Long in our application if the member id can not be represented by Double losslessly when the member id is very big.\r\n\r\nHere is an example how this happens, with\r\n```\r\n      Seq[(java.lang.Long, java.lang.Double)]((null, 3.14), (9123146099426677101L, null),\r\n        (9123146560113991650L, 1.6), (null, null)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").na.fill(0.2),\r\n```\r\nthe logical plan will be\r\n```\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: bigint, b: double\r\nProject [cast(coalesce(cast(a#232L as double), cast(0.2 as double)) as bigint) AS a#240L, cast(coalesce(nanvl(b#233, cast(null as double)), 0.2) as double) AS b#241]\r\n+- Project [_1#229L AS a#232L, _2#230 AS b#233]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [_1#229L, _2#230]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that even the value is not null, Spark will cast the Long into Double first. Then if it's not null, Spark will cast it back to Long which results in losing precision.\r\n\r\nThe behavior should be that the original value should not be changed if it's not null, but Spark will change the value which is wrong.\r\n\r\nWith the PR, the logical plan will be\r\n```\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: bigint, b: double\r\nProject [coalesce(a#232L, cast(0.2 as bigint)) AS a#240L, coalesce(nanvl(b#233, cast(null as double)), cast(0.2 as double)) AS b#241]\r\n+- Project [_1#229L AS a#232L, _2#230 AS b#233]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [_1#229L, _2#230]\r\n```\r\nwhich behaves correctly without changing the original Long values and also avoids extra cost of unnecessary casting.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit test added.\r\n\r\n+cc @srowen @rxin @cloud-fan @gatorsmile \r\n\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-04-09T08:05:00Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T05:19:30Z","closed_at":"2017-04-10T05:19:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1209649a81d152d68146daae1fd5e398e6cfd828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3fb1a66c84021b4b2cc223aff82e001f4cd7df03","head":{"label":"dbtsai:fixnafill","ref":"fixnafill","sha":"3fb1a66c84021b4b2cc223aff82e001f4cd7df03","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request\r\n\r\nTrying to get a grip on the `FileIndex` hierarchy, I was confused by the following inconsistency:\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, `PartitioningAwareFileIndex` defines `leafFiles` and `leafDirToChildrenFiles` as abstract, but on the other it fully implements `listLeafFiles` which does all the listing of files. However, the latter is only used by `InMemoryFileIndex`.\r\n\r\nI'm hereby proposing to move this method (and all its dependencies) to the implementation class that actually uses it, and thus unclutter the `PartitioningAwareFileIndex` interface.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`./build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR elminates unnecessary nullchecks of a return value from known Spark runtime routines. We know whether a given Spark runtime routine returns ``null`` or not (e.g. ``ArrayData.toDoubleArray()`` never returns ``null``). Thus, we can eliminate a null check for the return value from the Spark runtime routine.\r\n\r\nWhen we run the following example program, now we get the Java code \"Without this PR\". In this code, since we know ``ArrayData.toDoubleArray()`` never returns ``null```, we can eliminate null checks at lines 90-92, and 97.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nval ds =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR elminates unnecessary data conversion, which is introduced by SPARK-19716, for Dataset with primitve array in the generated Java code.\r\nWhen we run the following example program, now we get the Java code \"Without this PR\". In this code, lines 56-82 are unnecessary since the primitive array in ArrayData can be converted into Java primitive array by using ``toDoubleArray()`` method. ``GenericArrayData`` is not required.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nval ds = sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(Array(1.1, 2.2)), 1).toDS.cache\r\nds.count\r\nds.map(e => e).show\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout this PR\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCame across the term \"slice\" when running some spark scala code. Consequently, a Google search indicated that \"slices\" and \"partitions\" refer to the same things; indeed see:\r\n\r\n- [This issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1701)\r\n- [This pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2305)\r\n- [This StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23436640/what-is-the-difference-between-an-rdd-partition-and-a-slice) and [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24269495/what-are-the-differences-between-slices-and-partitions-of-rdds)\r\n\r\nThus this pull request fixes the occurrence of slice I came accross. Nonetheless, [it would appear](https://github.com/apache/spark/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=slice&type=) there are still many references to \"slice/slices\" - thus I thought I'd raise this Pull Request to address the issue (sorry if this is the wrong place, I'm not too familar with raising apache issues).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Not tested locally - only a minor exception message change.)\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-07T11:04:40Z","updated_at":"2017-04-09T06:50:02Z","closed_at":"2017-04-09T06:49:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f5c40a4bddc62802a316a6993e19963bc648c2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/844df1036f52bbf49ea034e7972d5af997c5a9a8","head":{"label":"asmith26:master","ref":"master","sha":"844df1036f52bbf49ea034e7972d5af997c5a9a8","user":{"login":"asmith26","id":6988036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODgwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6988036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26","html_url":"https://github.com/asmith26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87536090,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzUzNjA5MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"asmith26/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asmith26","id":6988036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODgwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6988036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26","html_url":"https://github.com/asmith26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmith26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asmith26/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a spark.ui.stopDelay configuration property that can be used to keep the UI running when an application has finished.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFind spark1.6 version of the memory management of the Bug, spark.memory.storageFraction and the official website of the problem.\r\n\r\n## How

%f\".format(storageMemoryPool.memoryFree/1024.0/1024.0))               logInfo(\"onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryFree %f\".format(onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryFree/1024.0/1024.0))

logInfo(\"onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.poolSize %f\".format(onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.poolSize/1024.0/1024.0))\r\n  When I run the PageRank program, the input file for PageRank is generated by the BigDataBench-Chinese Academy of Sciences and is used to evaluate large data analysis system tools with a size of 676M. The information submitted is as follows:\r\n./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPageRank \\\r\n    --master yarn \\\r\n    --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n    --num-executors 1 \\\r\n    --driver-memory 4g \\\r\n    --executor-memory 7g \\\r\n    --executor-cores 6 \\\r\n    --queue thequeue \\\r\n    ./examples/target/scala-2.10/spark-examples-1.6.2-hadoop2.2.0.jar \\\r\n     /test/Google_genGraph_23.txt 6\r\nThe configuration is as follows：\r\nspark.memory.useLegacyMode=false\r\nspark.memory.fraction=0.75\r\nspark.memory.storageFraction=0.2\r\nLog information is as follows：\r\n17/02/28 11:07:34 INFO memory.UnifiedMemoryManager: storageMemoryPool.memoryFree 0.000000\r\n17/02/28 11:07:34 INFO memory.UnifiedMemoryManager: onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryFree

5663.325877\r\nAccording to the configuration, storageMemoryPool.poolSize at least 1G or more, but the log information is only 0.299123M, so there is an error.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFind spark1.6 version of the memory management of the Bug, spark.memory.storageFraction and the official website of the problem.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added some log information to the UnifiedMemoryManager file as follows:\r\nlogInfo(\"storageMemoryPool.memoryFree %f\".format(storageMemoryPool.memoryFree/1024.0/1024.0))               logInfo(\"onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryFree %f\".format(onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryFree/1024.0/1024.0))             logInfo(\"storageMemoryPool.memoryUsed %f\".format(

%f\".format(onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.poolSize/1024.0/1024.0))\r\n  When I run the PageRank program, the input file for PageRank is generated by the BigDataBench-Chinese Academy of Sciences and is used to evaluate large data analysis system tools with a size of 676M. The information submitted is as follows:\r\n./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPageRank \\\r\n    --master yarn \\\r\n    --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n    --num-executors 1 \\\r\n    --driver-memory 4g \\\r\n    --executor-memory 7g \\\r\n    --executor-cores 6 \\\r\n    --queue thequeue \\\r\n    ./examples/target/scala-2.10/spark-examples-1.6.2-hadoop2.2.0.jar \\\r\n     /test/Google_genGraph_23.txt 6\r\nThe configuration is as follows：\r\nspark.memory.useLegacyMode=false\r\nspark.memory.fraction=0.75\r\nspark.memory.storageFraction=0.2\r\nLog information is as follows：\r\n17/02/28 11:07:34 INFO memory.UnifiedMemoryManager: storageMemoryPool.memoryFree 0.000000\r\n17/02/28 11:07:34 INFO memory.UnifiedMemoryManager: onHeapExecutionMemoryPool.memoryFree

5663.325877\r\nAccording to the configuration, storageMemoryPool.poolSize at least 1G or more, but the log information is only 0.299123M, so there is an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf you lose instances that have shuffle outputs, you will start observing messages like:\r\n```\r\n17/03/24 11:49:23 WARN TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 64.1 (TID 3849, 172.128.196.240, executor 0): FetchFailed(BlockManagerId(4, 172.128.200.157, 4048, None), shuffleId=16, mapId=2, reduceId=3, message=\r\n```\r\nGenerally, these messages are followed by:\r\n```\r\n17/03/24 11:49:23 INFO DAGScheduler: Executor lost: 4 (epoch 20)\r\n17/03/24 11:49:23 INFO BlockManagerMasterEndpoint: Trying to remove executor 4 from

Spark resubmits tasks for data that has been lost.

In later retries of the stage, Spark will attempt to access files on machines that don't exist anymore, and then after 4 tries, Spark will give up. If it had not ignored the fetch failure, and invalidated the cache, then most of the lost files could have been computed during one of the previous retries.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

random number generated by XORShiftRandom.nextDouble() is a value between zero and one, including zero but not including one. I.e., 0 <= x < 1 . I've denoted this by changing the closing square bracket to a closing parenthesis.\r\n\r\nYou can also think of trying to uniformly randomly assign items in a list to three classes 'A', 'B' and 'C'. For each item, if {randomDouble * 3.0} is between 0.000 and 0.999, it gets assigned to A. If between 1.000 and 1.999, it goes to B. If between 2.000 and 2.999 it goes to C. All three classes have the same probability of receiving the item. If it were possible for the raw random number to be exactly 1.000, then after scaling the range by multiplying times 3.0 class C would be slightly more likely to receive the item than A or B (assuming simple logic instead of more extensive/expensive logic to break ties).\r\n\r\nAlso, see the existing comment in SamplingUtils which uses the same function:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike `Expression`, `QueryPlan` should also have a `semanticHash` method, then we can put plans to a hash map and look it up fast. This PR refactors `QueryPlan` to follow `Expression` and put all the normalization logic in `QueryPlan.canonicalized`, so that it's very natural to implement `semanticHash`.\r\n\r\nfollow-up: improve `CacheManager` to leverage this `semanticHash` and speed up plan lookup, instead of iterating all cached plans.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests. Note that we don't need to test the `semanticHash` method, once the existing tests prove `sameResult` is correct, we are good.","created_at":"2017-04-05T17:56:22Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T05:39:02Z","closed_at":"2017-04-10T05:39:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a190a35f250f7c9ec093a93ce51df23b1c5b4316","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/295acc9bf7da22dcbe24bf99ff024ffe6f67d51a","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:plan-semantic","ref":"plan-semantic","sha":"295acc9bf7da22dcbe24bf99ff024ffe6f67d51a","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen data is highly skewed on `ShuffledRDD`, it make sense to launch those tasks which process much more input as soon as possible. The current scheduling mechanism in `TaskSetManager` is quite simple:\r\n```\r\nfor (i <- (0 until numTasks).reverse) {\r\n    addPendingTask(i)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn scenario that \"large tasks\" locate at bottom half of tasks array, if tasks with much more input are launched early, we can significantly reduce the time cost and save resource when \"dynamic allocation\" is disabled.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test in 'TaskSetManagerSuite'.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-05T03:36:06Z","updated_at":"2017-06-02T16:14:29Z","closed_at":"2017-06-02T16:14:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b04d364d657fcf6db264d632bc88a56e1037f4c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7212089c6d90b30f22d6f94538558dcf3e892a44","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-20219","ref":"SPARK-20219","sha":"7212089c6d90b30f22d6f94538558dcf3e892a44","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`_convert_to_vector` converts a scipy sparse matrix to csc matrix for initializing `SparseVector`. However, it doesn't guarantee the converted csc matrix has sorted indices and so a failure happens when you do something like that:\r\n\r\n    from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\r\n    lil = lil_matrix((4, 1))\r\n    lil[1, 0] = 1\r\n    lil[3, 0] = 2\r\n    _convert_to_vector(lil.todok())\r\n\r\n    File \"/home/jenkins/workspace/python/pyspark/mllib/linalg/__init__.py\", line 78, in _convert_to_vector\r\n      return SparseVector(l.shape[0], csc.indices, csc.data)\r\n    File \"/home/jenkins/workspace/python/pyspark/mllib/linalg/__init__.py\", line 556, in __init__\r\n      % (self.indices[i], self.indices[i + 1]))\r\n    TypeError: Indices 3 and 1 are not strictly increasing\r\n\r\n\r\nA simple test can confirm that `dok_matrix.tocsc()` won't guarantee sorted indices:\r\n\r\n    >>> from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\r\n    >>> lil = lil_matrix((4, 1))\r\n    >>> lil[1, 0] = 1\r\n    >>> lil[3, 0] = 2\r\n    >>> dok = lil.todok()\r\n    >>> csc = dok.tocsc()\r\n    >>> csc.has_sorted_indices\r\n    0\r\n    >>> csc.indices\r\n    array([3, 1], dtype=int32)\r\n\r\nI checked the source codes of scipy. The only way to guarantee it is `csc_matrix.tocsr()` and `csr_matrix.tocsc()`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-05T03:30:52Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:26Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T00:49:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"594507906e05ec49f10dadecd51cfa99fcc98a2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2612d66c9eb5ebdf1ca5dfb61a687e37afbcb54a","head":{"label":"viirya:make-sure-sorted-indices","ref":"make-sure-sorted-indices","sha":"2612d66c9eb5ebdf1ca5dfb61a687e37afbcb54a","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf tasks throw non-interrupted exceptions on kill (e.g. java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException), their death is reported back as TaskFailed instead of TaskKilled. This causes stage failure in some cases.\r\n\r\nThis is reproducible as follows. Run the following, and then use SparkContext.killTaskAttempt to kill one of the tasks. The entire stage will fail since we threw a RuntimeException instead of InterruptedException.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(100).repartition(100).foreach { i =>\r\n  try {\r\n    Thread.sleep(10000000)\r\n  } catch {\r\n    case t: InterruptedException =>\r\n      throw new RuntimeException(t)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBased on the code in TaskSetManager, I think this also affects kills of speculative tasks. However, since the number of speculated tasks is few, and usually you need to fail a task a few times before the stage is cancelled, it unlikely this would be noticed in production unless both speculation was enabled and the num allowed task failures was = 1.\r\n\r\nWe should probably unconditionally return TaskKilled instead of TaskFailed if the task was killed by the driver, regardless of the actual exception thrown.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test. The test fails before the change in Executor.scala\r\n\r\ncc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`precision` in a decimal indicates the length of the arbitrary precision integer. Here are a few examples of numbers with the same scale, but different precision:\r\n\r\n- 12345 / 100000 = 0.12345 // scale = 5, precision = 5\r\n- 12340 / 100000 = 0.1234 // scale = 5, precision = 4\r\n- 1 / 100000 = 0.00001 // scale = 5, precision = 1\r\n\r\nThis PR fix a bug in `floor` and `ceil` in `org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal` that will throw a `Decimal scale (0) cannot be greater than precision (-2)` exception when its `precision < scale`.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, the following SQL will throw an exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect 1 > 0.0001 from tb\r\nselect floor(0.0001) from tb\r\nselect ceil(0.0001) from tb\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2017-04-04T15:18:41Z","updated_at":"2017-06-11T06:40:43Z","closed_at":"2017-06-11T06:40:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cb7020e640efb0ab8b09004f911b31ead1176a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08e58df220cc55bc0faac0f869cb2b577a14a0db","head":{"label":"stanzhai:fix_decimal_precision","ref":"fix_decimal_precision","sha":"08e58df220cc55bc0faac0f869cb2b577a14a0db","user":{"login":"stanzhai","id":1438757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzg3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1438757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai","html_url":"https://github.com/stanzhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28219758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODIxOTc1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"stanzhai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stanzhai","id":1438757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzg3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1438757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai","html_url":"https://github.com/stanzhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanzhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stanzhai/spark","description":"Mirror
