details to come. And tests.~~\r\n\r\nWhen a ti worker goes for too long without a heartbeat, the scheduler would identify it as a zombie, and stop it from running any longer. However, the scheduler does not perform housekeeping correctly, and in some cases the executor (of the ti) would still _think_ the ti is still running.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an explicit call to the executor to tell it the ti has been terminated and should be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nSome tests were modified to check this cleanup is performing as expected. Those tests were actually not set up correctly, likely due to changes from AIP-61, mocking the wrong attribute and failing to actually assert the behaviour. They have been fixed to mock ExecutorLoader instead, which is the canonical executor source after AIP-61 implementation.","created_at":"2024-10-11T09:34:45Z","updated_at":"2024-10-23T09:03:57Z","closed_at":"2024-10-16T02:32:58Z","merged_at":"2024-10-16T02:32:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"6549b1798f6e682b5db6060d9aa89dd2e155ffb5","assignee":{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

in CI, if changes are detected in the legacy UI/API files, the build fails with an error.\r\n\r\nCI failures: https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/11275130446/job/31374289057#step:8:271\r\n\r\nThe `is_legacy_ui_api_labeled` flag uses the changed_files to determine the labels. Currently, the changed_files condition relies on the commit_ref, which is the Git SHA ID. This condition is always true, in my opinion. Here's an example: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/11275130446/job/31374289057#step:2:15\r\n\r\nThe logic for changed_files is built as shown here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/src/airflow_breeze/commands/ci_commands.py#L257\r\n\r\nIn the case of canary builds, full tests are triggered, so the `is_legacy_ui_api_labeled` check becomes unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions for fixing this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Set changed_files to an empty list during canary builds.\r\n2. Add a condition to check `_is_canary_run`.\r\n\r\nI recommend going with the second option, as I'm unsure of the potential side effects of the first.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

commit introduces versioning for DAGs.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Introduced DagVersion model to handle versioning of DAGs.\r\n- Added version_name field to DAG for use in tracking the dagversion by users\r\n- Modified DAG execution logic to reference dag_version_id instead of the dag_hash to ensure DAG runs are linked to specific versions.\r\n\r\nThe table relations:\r\n<img width=\"737\"

If a dag's serialized dict changes, a new serialized dag will be registered based on the hash diference, and consequently, a new dag version and dag code.

Remove `axios` and switch our codegen to `fetch`. It was much easier to correctly catch the http error.\r\n\r\n2. Our opengen treats both error as `unknown` and error.body as `unknown`. [Open GitHub issue on codegen](https://github.com/7nohe/openapi-react-query-codegen/issues/147). Therefore we had to manually assert a lot of the type values, even though they exist in the openapi spec.

the DAG response, ensuring that no existing data is
