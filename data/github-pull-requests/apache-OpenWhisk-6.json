Future[Boolean] to Future[Option[Boolean]]. Motivation is to signal that the entitlement request couldn't be performed at all if calling an external entitlement service failed because of a network error or unavailability of the service itself so that the caller can act more appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis code change changes the SPI entitlement interface from Future[Boolean] to Future[Option[Boolean]] and adapts the SPI entitlement implementation in _LocalEntitlementProvider_ accordingly. It also introduces a _failedToCheckAccessResourceAuthorization_ as new error response and adapts the _check_ method accordingly.<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

reasons explained in detail in this *dev.openwhisk.apache.org* discussion thread ([Make the formula to calculate the action time limit more configurable](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/339d39b40a3078d59573fdc45ba2af10040947dfd557966617aa6fb1@<dev.openwhisk.apache.org>)) it would be beneficial to have \r\nthe constant duration of 1 minute that is added to the calculated completion ack timeout duration configurable. Motivation is to have a better control over the applied completion ack timeout and by this to avoid the forced completion of activations in situations where it causes trouble.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis code change removes the constant duration of one minute used in the formula to calculate the completion ack timeout but adds a configurable parameter instead. This parameter defaults to the value of 1 minute, so the code that calculates the duration within a completion ack must be received for an activation behaves the same if the default is used.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

validate state of containers before use.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn our deployment case (mesos/kubernetes) there are occasional cases where prewarm/warm containers fail outside of the usage of ContainerProxy, but ContainerProxy/ContainerPool are not aware of these failures. When this happens, when eventually the containers are used, there is a guarantee of failing the activation, since ContainerProxy assumes the prewarm/warm container is running fine, and it just sees a failure for /init or /run. \r\n\r\nThis may be more pertinent to ContainerFactory impls that launch containers on hosts other than the invoker (mesos, k8s, yarn), but since it is also possible for docker containers local to invoker to be interrupted by some other system, it may be useful in all cases as a preventative measure. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a tcp connection health check from invoker to each action container where:\r\n- prewarm containers will be connected periodically\r\n- failure to connect to prewarm will eventually (after configurable number of failures) cause the container to be destroyed and deplaced with a new prewarm container\r\n- warm containers (paused) will be connected immediately after resume, and immediately before usage for /run\r\n- failure to connect to warm will cause the job to be rescheduled and the warm container to be destroyed\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Alpakka Kafka to 1.1.0. This is currently used by user-events service and comosdb cache invalidator service\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPer [release notes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka-kafka/current/release-notes/1.1.x.html#1-1-0)\r\n\r\n> Alpakka Kafka 1.1 changes the internals of how offset commits are sent to the Kafka broker. The new implementation is very beneficial for high-throughput consumers as committing is now connected to the regular polling of the Kafka consumer, which reduces pressure on Kafka.\r\n\r\nFurther this PR also includes couple of small fixes\r\n\r\n1. Fixes inclusion of test library in compile scope by user-events\r\n2. Turns off the very verbose logging from embedded Kafka completely\r\n3. Reduce some of the test timings\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the command examples used for wskadmin-next as identified in #4687\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n`wskadmin-next` cli support differs in some forms from the python based `wskadmin` due to difference in argument parsing support used by backing libraries \r\n\r\n1. `wskadmin-next` - [scallop](https://github.com/scallop/scallop)\r\n2. `wskadmin` - [argoarse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)\r\n\r\nBase difference\r\n\r\n1. `-ns` in `wskadmin` vs `--namespace` in `wskadmin-next` - Python support short args with single `-` while with scallop only supports single letter short form. Hence one need to use wither `-n` or better `--namespace`\r\n2. Argument positioning - Python support options after the trailing input like `user delete userB -ns space1`. With scallop we need to pass all the options first `user delete --namespace space1 userB`\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR adds support for providing a base Pod template to customize the action Pod created by KubernetesContainerFactory (KCF)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nSometime back we [discussed a usecase on DL][1] to configure a private registry for action containers. This PR now enables that usecase via an optional `pod-template` config\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nProvide the base pod template via config like below\r\n\r\nPod template yaml stored at \"/pod-template.yaml` \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\napiVersion: \"v1\"\r\nkind: \"Pod\"\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    allow-outbound : \"true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  spi {\r\n    ContainerFactoryProvider = \"org.apache.openwhisk.core.containerpool.kubernetes.KubernetesContainerFactoryProvider\"\r\n  }\r\n  kubernetes {\r\n    pod-template = \"file:/pod-template.yaml\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen KCF would create an action container POD it would use the above template as base and add the changes required by OpenWhisk on top of that. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 ways to pass this yaml config\r\n\r\n#### 1. Inline\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  kubernetes {\r\n    pod-template = \"\"\"---\r\napiVersion: \"v1\"\r\nkind: \"Pod\"\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    allow-outbound : \"true\"\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. Via File reference\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  kubernetes {\r\n    pod-template = \"file:/pod-template.yaml\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere the file can be mounted from a config map\r\n\r\n#### 3. Via ENV\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhisk {\r\n  kubernetes {\r\n    pod-template = ${WHISK_POD_TEMPLATE}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the env `WHISK_POD_TEMPLATE` is configured via a ConfigMap value\r\n\r\nTo see the final POD spec this PR also enables support for logging the pod spec in yaml via `X-OW-EXTRA-LOGGING` header (#3174). \r\n\r\nFor example assume that setup has a `hello` action configured (say using #4671). \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -k --dump-header -  -X POST \\\r\n      --user \"23bc46b1-71f6-4ed5-8c54-816aa4f8c502:123zO3xZCLrMN6v2BKK1dXYFpXlPkccOFqm12CdAsMgRU4VrNZ9lyGVCGuMDGIwP\" \\\r\n      -H \"X-OW-EXTRA-LOGGING: on\" \\\r\n      \"http://localhost:3233/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/hello?blocking=true&result=true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen above command would log the pod spec\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n[2019-10-15T16:23:12.659Z] [INFO] [#tid_B7WSlmTXLKHTDCH0TYb6mcf6ttpyKNrZ] [KubernetesClient] Pod spec being created\r\n---\r\napiVersion: \"v1\"\r\nkind: \"Pod\"\r\nmetadata:\r\n  annotations:\r\n    allow-outbound: \"true\"\r\n  labels:\r\n    name: \"wsk0-1-guest-hello3\"\r\n    invoker: \"invoker0\"\r\n  name: \"wsk0-1-guest-hello3\"\r\n  namespace: \"default\"\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n  - env:\r\n    - name: \"__OW_API_HOST\"\r\n      value: \"http://host.docker.internal:3233\"\r\n    image: \"openwhisk/action-nodejs-v10:1.14.0-incubating\"\r\n    name: \"user-action\"\r\n    ports:\r\n    - containerPort: 8080\r\n      name: \"action\"\r\n    resources:\r\n      limits:\r\n        memory: \"256Mi\"\r\n      requests: {}\r\n    securityContext:\r\n      capabilities:\r\n        drop:\r\n        - \"NET_RAW\"\r\n        - \"NET_ADMIN\"\r\n  nodeSelector: {}\r\n  restartPolicy: \"Always\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis spec includes the custom annotation configured in base template `allow-outbound`\r\n\r\n### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nWith `pod-template` one can configure any k8s supported config for the `Pod`. Each such pod would always have  a  `container` named `user-action`. Following aspects though would be controlled by KCF \r\n\r\n1. Container memory limit\r\n2. Container port\r\n3. Container env\r\n4. Container securityContext would always have `NET_RAW` and `NET_ADMIN` dropped. One can \"add\" more capabilities\r\n5.

a `NoopActivationStore` which does not store the activation and acts like `/dev/null` for the activation response. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nTo simplify local performance testing of the overhead of the control plane flow (invocation logic path in Controller/Invoker) it would be useful have an `ActivationStore` which does not store the activation result. \r\n\r\nThis ensures that one can run say 10k activations without worrying about the storage cost. \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nBelow steps demonstrate one way of using this store with Standalone OpenWhisk server\r\n\r\n#### 1. Prepare configuration\r\n\r\nCreate a `standalone-perf.conf` with below content\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude classpath(\"standalone.conf\")\r\n\r\nwhisk {\r\n  spi {\r\n    LogStoreProvider = \"org.apache.openwhisk.core.containerpool.logging.LogDriverLogStoreProvider\"\r\n    ActivationStoreProvider = \"org.apache.openwhisk.core.database.memory.NoopActivationStoreProvider\"\r\n  }\r\n  //TODO Configure concurrecny\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhere we configure\r\n\r\n1. NoopActivationStoreProvider to swallow all the activation result\r\n2. LogDriverLogStoreProvider - Disable the log collection overhead\r\n\r\n#### 2. Run the server\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -Dlogback.log.level=warn -jar openwhisk-standalone.jar -c standalone-perf.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow attach the [Java Async Profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler). If using Intellij you can use its [inbuilt support for async profiler](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/cpu-profiler.html)\r\n\r\n#### 3. Run perf test\r\n\r\nCreate a hello world action and invoke it multiple times\r\n\r\n```\r\nab -p post.json -T application/json -H 'Authorization: Basic MjNiYzQ2YjEtNzFmNi00ZWQ1LThjNTQtODE2YWE0ZjhjNTAyOjEyM3pPM3haQ0xyTU42djJCS0sxZFhZRnBYbFBrY2NPRnFtMTJDZEFzTWdSVTRWck5aOWx5R1ZDR3VNREdJd1A=' -c 2 -n 10000 \"http://localhost:3233/api/v1/namespaces/_/actions/hello?blocking=true&result=true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPost run collect the profiler result and analyze the stats\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

support for configuring `KubernetesContainerFactory` (KCF) with Standalone OpenWhisk for simplified local development for KCF.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nTo simplify developing on KCF locally this PR adds support for configuring KCF via `--dev-kcf` flag. \r\n\r\n### Local Port Forwardning\r\n\r\nTo enable this mode a new config option is added to enable port forwarding\r\n\r\n```\r\nwsk {\r\n  kubernetes {\r\n    # Enables forwarding to remote port via a local random port. This mode is mostly useful\r\n    # for development via Standalone mode\r\n    port-forwarding-enabled = false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this mode is enabled then after launching a pod a local port forward would be enabled and that port would then be used by `ContainerProxy` to communicate with the pod running with k8s\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo try out this feature\r\n\r\n#### 1. Install and configure Kind\r\n\r\nWe would use [Kind][1] to setup a local k8s. Follow the steps [here][1] to create a simple cluster\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ kind create cluster --wait 5m\r\n\r\n# Export the kind config for kubectl usage\r\n$ export KUBECONFIG=\"$(kind get kubeconfig-path)\"\r\n\r\n# Configure the default namespace\r\n$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default\r\n\r\n# See the config path\r\n$ kind get kubeconfig-path\r\n/Users/chetanm/.kube/kind-config-kind\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. Launch Standalone \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n\r\n# Build the standalone jar\r\n$ ./gradlew :core:standalone:build\r\n\r\n# Launch it with `kubeconfig` system property set to kind config\r\n$ java  -Dkubeconfig=\"$(kind get kubeconfig-path)\" -jar bin/openwhisk-standalone.jar --dev-kcf\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce started and required `.wskprops` configured (see standalone startup logs for details) create a `hello.js` function\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction main(params) {\r\n    greeting = 'hello, world'\r\n    var hello = {payload: greeting}\r\n    var result = {...hello, ...process.env}\r\n    console.log(greeting);\r\n    return result\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ wsk action create hello hello.js\r\n$ wsk action invoke hello -br\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows an output like below\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"HOME\": \"/root\",\r\n    \"HOSTNAME\": \"wsk0-2-prewarm-nodejs10\",\r\n    \"KUBERNETES_PORT\": \"tcp://10.96.0.1:443\",\r\n    \"KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP\":

PR expose the metrics related to specific Kafka producer or consumer over `/metrics/kafka` endpoint. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor now this feature is enabled for User Event service where the event consumer's Kafka consumer instance  metrics are exposed. Such metrics can provide insight into the Kafka consumers processing stats.\r\n\r\nThe http endpoint is not exposed to end user and meant for developers and system admins to understand the performance characteristics of the consumer at any given time by direct access\r\n\r\nIt also registers the `KamonMetricsReporter` (introduced via #4481) with the User Event consumer to expose some of those metrics as Kamon metrics\r\n\r\nA typical response for the `/metrics/kafka` endpoint is like below ( > 100 entries)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"description\": \"The number of responses received per second\",\r\n    \"group\": \"consumer-node-metrics\",\r\n    \"name\": \"response-rate\",\r\n    \"tags\": {\r\n      \"client-id\": \"event-consumer\",\r\n      \"node-id\": \"node--1\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value\": 0.05848409232688709\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"description\": \"The total number of connections with successful authentication\",\r\n    \"group\": \"consumer-metrics\",\r\n    \"name\": \"successful-authentication-total\",\r\n    \"tags\": {\r\n      \"client-id\": \"event-consumer\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value\": 0\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"description\": \"The maximum size of any request sent.\",\r\n    \"group\": \"consumer-metrics\",\r\n    \"name\": \"request-size-max\",\r\n    \"tags\": {\r\n      \"client-id\": \"event-consumer\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value\": 179\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"description\": \"The total number of bytes consumed\",\r\n    \"group\": \"consumer-fetch-manager-metrics\",\r\n    \"name\": \"bytes-consumed-total\",\r\n    \"tags\": {\r\n      \"client-id\": \"event-consumer\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"value\": 0\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\nLater we plan to enable this feature with Activation Persister Service (#4632) also\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nWhen enabled via config, if the following are true, the result portion of Activation document will not be included in db record that is stored (no change in response seen by client):\r\n* Activation is blocking\r\n* Activation response is successful\r\n* ?debug=true parameter was not included by client\r\n* timeout not exceeded (a new timeout, specific to this configuration)\r\n\r\nIn these cases, results are very unlikely to ever be accessed in database, so this will save space. It can be useful for cases where there are a large number of significant size results created (>500k?) which can accumulate 100s of GB or TB of space.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#4626 )\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\nCurrently, the container scheduling strategy is CPU share, using `docker run --cpu-shares`. \r\nAnd we use `poolConfig.userMemory` to specify **every** `Invoker` node's memory pool size. *(Did I miss sth? Do me a favor to correct me if needed.)*\r\nIt's easy to understand, and robust enough to fit most of the deployment case.\r\n\r\nBut what if we wanna deploy `Invoker` in some resource-limited machine (eg. 4 cores CPU and 8 GB memory, only use 4 cores and 4GB memory), or K8S nodes with different memory resource?\r\nAnd How to figure out the best `userMemory` in a cluster without boiling CPUs and saving testing time, if most of the actions are CPU consuming, such as AI functions?\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nAdd **CPU limit mode** to make things happened.\r\n\r\n* Add a configuration `whisk.cpu.control-enabled` to `application.conf`.\r\n    * `false` by **default**, which means we use the good old way.\r\n    * `true` to turn on the scheduling feature.\r\n* When turned on\r\n   * Each invoker would report its CPU threads info (number of CPU logic cores) when registering.\r\n   * `ShardingContainerPoolBalancer` use CPU slots the same behavior as memory slots.\r\n   * `ContainerPool` use CPU (first) and memory (second) for pool space calculation.\r\n   * `ContainerFactory` add a new method `createCPUContainer()`.\r\n   * `DockerContainer` add `createByCPU()` with `docker run --cpus` implementation.\r\n   * `Action` add CPU limit annotations, `min/std/max`.\r\n* Add CLI supporting\r\n    * Add `--cpu` parameter to `wsk` CLI.\r\n    * The commit done and tested.\r\n    * The PR not uploaded yet.\r\n* Add K8S deploy options\r\n    * Add `whisk.limits.actions.cpu` configuration.\r\n    * The commit done and tested.\r\n    * The PR not uploaded yet.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n* Done locally and in a 4-cloud-nodes K8S cluster.\r\n    * Invoker node with 4 CPUs and 4 GB memory as most.\r\n    * AI function. `--docker` creation, `blackbox` run type, which take 300 MB.\r\n    * **Almost identical** as the best deployment setting case.\r\n\r\n### TODO:\r\n\r\n* [ ] More documentation on this topic.\r\n* [ ] Coverage tests.\r\n* [ ] More measurement tests.\r\n* [ ] Sequence action behavior tests.\r\n    * Not familiar with these concepts and execution process.\r\n\r\n***Issue needed?

local setups on Mac using Standalone OpenWhisk mode sometime few test fail. Also some times some steps in compositions are seen to fail. In all such cases the failure happens due to failure during initialization due to `NoHttpResponseException`\r\n\r\nFor some container upon retry the init seems to pass fine. This PR modifies the `ApacheBlockingContainerClient` logic to enable retry for `NoHttpResponseException` based on explicit config.\r\n\r\nBy default `NoHttpResponseException` would not be retried. However if config is enabled then retry would be performed. For standalone case this config is enabled.\r\n\r\nWith this change all test now pass on Mac in a reliable way. This is also needed for some conductor related test in #4632\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR introduces a new micro service - `Activation Persister Service` (APS). This is based on discussion done [here][1] and [here][2]. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis service fullfills following objective\r\n\r\n1. Move out the load of persisting Activation results from Invoker to a new service\r\n2. Enables a more controlled write to backend db in case rate of production of activation is more than the rate at which db can persist them within given capacity\r\n\r\nWith this service the activation results would now instead written to a Kafka topic and then picked by this service and then saved in db. The approach taken here varies with following parameters\r\n\r\n1. Is the activation for a blocking or non blocking call\r\n2. Is the activation result being persisted from Controller (for sequence/composition) or from Invoker\r\n3. Does the setup stores logs as part of activation or store them seprately\r\n\r\n### Components\r\n\r\nThe implementation consist of following high level components\r\n\r\n1. Activation Persister Service (APS) - A new service impl in `core/persister` module. It is based on [Alpakka Kafka][3] and reads the activation record from Kafka and saves them to db\r\n2. `KafkaActivationStore` - An extension of `ArtifactActivationStore` which also routes to Kafka via `MessageProducer` connector\r\n3. InvokerReactive - The `send` logic would be modfied (details below)\r\n4. New Kafka topic \r\n    1. `completed-others` - This topic is meant to be used for setups using `LogDriverLogStore` i.e. where logs are not stored in activation result. Further note that the name of topic confirms to pattern `completed.*` such that Kafka consumer used within ActivationPersisterService can pickup this topic along with other completed topics created per controller\r\n        1. Non blocking activations - Currently non blocking activations are not sent over Kafka. So this topic would be used for them. We did used the existing `completed<controllerId>` as they are strictly used for blocking case\r\n        2. Activations originating from controller - All activations from controller like for trigger, conductor and sequence would be sent via this topic. Again these are currently directly stored in db and not sent on any other kafka topic\r\n    2. `activations` - This topic name would be used when setup stores the log within activation result. Note that in this case if APS used one need to ensure that Kafka can carry messages of size upto 10MB (or configured log limits)\r\n\r\nSome key aspects which impact the implementation are\r\n\r\n1. Blocking/Non Blocking - Depending on invocation type the nature of activation result sent via Kafka `completed` topic varies\r\n    a. Blocking - The `ResultMessage` contains the activation result without logs\r\n    b. Non Blocking - Only `CompletionMessage` is sent\r\n\r\n### Activation Persister Service\r\n\r\nThis service implements a streaming flow based on [Alpakka Kafka][3]. It runs in 2 modes\r\n\r\n#### ActivationResult without Logs\r\n\r\nIf the setup does not store the activation with logs (uses some `LogDriverLogStore`) then persister service would listen for `ResultMessage` (and CombinedCompletionAndResultMessage post #4624) on all `completed.*` topics. This would also pickup records from `completed-others` topic.\r\n\r\nFurther how `ActivationStore` gets used would change\r\n\r\n1. Within `Controller` - Store all activations to `completed-others` via `KafkaActivationStore`\r\n2. Within `Invoker` - The `store` function would be initialized to a noop function. Here we did not went for a `NoopActivationStore` as that would cause issue when configuring this setup with `StandaloneOpenWhisk` for test setup as such a setup can only have a single `ActivationStore` impl\r\n\r\nInvokerReactive send flow would send all WhiskActivation result for blocking calls to existing `completed<instanceId>` topic. In addition non blocking results would also get routed to Kafka to `completed-others`\r\n\r\n#### ActivationResult with Logs\r\n\r\nIn this mode APS would listen for messages on `activations` topic. `KafkaActivationStore` would route all activations to this topic\r\n\r\n[1]: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/7c14d2075e4f8258ec6e909f6b443f4b899b9982103a29b520d963ac@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E\r\n[2]:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/0f51397cfe6a910e67b8400f8dbbf07ea46dddd8b8c3b31c771510a8@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E\r\n[3]: https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka-kafka/current/home.html\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

support for launching Embedded Kafka and Kafka Drop UI\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for launching an [embedded-kafka][1]. This is mostly meant to enable local development for features which need Kafka support (like User Event or Activation Persister Service etc). In this mode an inprocess Kafka Server (v2.1.1 currently) and Zookeeper Server\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew :core:standalone:build\r\n$ java -jar bin/openwhisk-standalone.jar --kafka\r\n\r\n# Or just run from OpenWhisk home dir\r\n$ ./gradlew :core:standalone:bootRun --args='--kafka'\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey aspects\r\n\r\n* Kafka version 2.1.1 is being used while we run with 0.11.0.1. Tried to use that but then it causes class compatability issue with newer version of Kafka client being used\r\n* This mode is also useful to simulate some of the integration test scenarios with Activation Persister Service\r\n* Kafka Server launched is supporting connection from both host and within Docker container based on [kafka listeners explanation][3]\r\n* Kafka and Zookeeper generated files are stored in `~/.openwhisk/standalone/server-3233/tmp` and are removed upon restart\r\n\r\nOnce launched you can see the details of port used etc as below\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ 9092  ] localhost:9092 (kafka)\r\n[ 9092  ] 192.168.65.2:9091 (kafka-docker)\r\n[ 2181  ] Zookeeper (zookeeper)\r\n[ 9000  ] http://localhost:9000 (whisk-kafka-drop-ui)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Kafka Ui - Kafdrop 3 \r\nThis PR also adds support for launching an optional [Kafdrop 3][2]\r\n\r\n```\r\njava -jar openwhisk-standalone.jar --kafka --kafka-ui\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis UI can help a developer to understand the structure of messages exchanged on various topics easily\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/664531/65041635-d71dd100-d974-11e9-8bec-e0673fefe1ca.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

or renaming runtime kinds and language families by simply changing the runtime manifest breaks existing actions. This change introduces documentation and adds background information to the pre-defined runtime manifests.\r\n\r\nFor example, a change like #4390 breaks existing actions.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `description` property to all pre-defined runtime manifests without updating the [`ExecManifest`](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/common/scala/src/main/scala/org/apache/openwhisk/core/entity/ExecManifest.scala) tooling. As a consequence, the `description` property is ignored by controllers and invokers and only serves documentation purposes. With that change, I hope to prevent unconscious changes of the runtimes breaking existing actions.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x] Pre-defined runtime manifests\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

the possibility to decide whether results should be included in the action log on a per-call basis for each activation individually.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAction results may contain sensible data that should not be logged. There is a system configuration flag (`writeResultToFile`) that can be used to switch on or off the result inclusion in logs. But this is a global switch that holds for all activations. In our case we want to able to decide per activation whether or not the result should be included in the log. In our special case we want results to be included in case of errors (in other words, 'Does the result contain an error field?'). But also other decision logic may be applicable. \r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- Controller (for sequences)\r\n- Invoker\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\nSmall, low risk change: add one optional, boolean parameter to the method `activationToFileExtended` of `org.apache.openwhisk.core.database.ActivationFileStorage` that determines the decision whether or not the result of the current activation should be included in the log. The default value of the new parameter is the value of the system configuration flag `writeResultToFile`. The method `activationToFile` is unchanged and works as before. The private method `transcribeActivation` now takes the flag from `activationToFileExtended`.

Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\nExisting message processing in ContainerPool can get into loops of immediately resending Run messagings causing cpu burn and crashing in cases where:\r\n- Run messages arrive but cannot be processed so begin queueing\r\n- First message in queue cannot be processed, and is resent constantly\r\n\r\nThis change alters the buffer handling to:\r\n- Not resend the same Run message during message processing\r\n- Only resend the head of queue Run message when some other event occurs that may free resources: scheduled to container, completed run in container, container is removed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a

Description\r\nContainerProxy states (ContainerData impls) may not propagate `lastUse` timestamp properly in certain states (concurrent cold start and prewarm use). \r\nThis fixes potential for

So far, log collection for managed Docker action containers waits for sentinels - even if a developer error occurs. Only if an action exceeded its init or run timeout, sentinel waiting will be disabled.\r\n* This change disables sentinel waiting for all developer errors because a managed action runtime may not be able to write sentinels at all in developer error situations. With this change, missing sentinels are handled in a more robust way.\r\n* Without sentinel waiting, the Docker action container log file is only read until file end is reached. No re-reads are performed if the sentinel has not been found yet. On busy systems, this may lead to a few missing log lines in case of developer errors.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
