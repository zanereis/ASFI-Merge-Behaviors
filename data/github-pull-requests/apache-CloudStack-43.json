Description\r\n**Problem**: Service, disk, network, and VPC offerings cannot be linked to specified multiple domain(s) and zone(s).\r\n**Root cause**: Service, disk, network, and VPC offerings are independent of zones. Service and disk offerings can be linked only to a single domain/sub-domain\r\n**Solution**: Service, disk, network, and VPC offerings will be allowed to be created with specified domain(s) and zone(s). Offerings linked with multiple domains and zones can be created both with UI and API. Refactored create offering  API to allow the passing list of domain and zone IDs with `domainid` and `zoneid` parameter respectively. UI has been refactored to allow selecting multiple domains and zones while creating offering using multi-select elements. When the list of passed domains contain both parent and child domains, the offering will be created for the parent domain. Offering details will now show a list of linked domains and zones as a comma-separated list of names. Linked domains and zones will be stored in the `cloud.*_offering_details` table in the database as a separate row for each domain and zone ID with key domainid and zoneid respectively.\r\nLinked domain(s) and zone(s) for an offering (service, disk, network, or VPC) can be updated using update*Offering API. To make a domain-specific offering public by root admin, `domainid=public` can be passed in the API call. To make a zone specific offering available for all zones by root admin, `zoneid=all` can be passed in the API call. Update Offering Access action has been added to the offerings page in UI which will allow updating linked domain(s) and zone(s) for an offering.\r\nDomain-admins can update compute and disk offerings. However, they can not change zones for the offerings specified for their domain or subdomains. They cannot change name, display text, sort-key for offerings specified for their domains/subdomains and also other domains which are not child domain for them. They can chnage domains(within their subdomains) for the offerings specified for their domains/subdomains.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n**Problem**: Volume created from a snapshot does not show its disk offering.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause**: The volume created from a snapshot of a root disk does not have a disk offering therefore the disk offering of the created volume from the snapshot is empty.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Refactored createVolume API and extended UI to allow user to select a disk offering while creating a volume using a root disk volume snapshot. For creating volumes using data disk volume snapshot, the disk offering given by the snapshot will be assigned. Disk offering selection in the UI form for volume creation from snapshot is depicted in screenshot below.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n**Problem**: Custom compute offering does not allow setting min and max values for CPU and VRAM for custom VMs. \r\n\r\n**Root Cause**: Custom compute offerings cannot be created with a

Also, UI form for compute offering creation is provided with a new field named 'compute offering type’ with values - Fixed, Custom Constrained, Custom Constrained. It will allow the creation of compute offerings either with a fixed CPU speed and memory for fixed compute offering, or with a range of CPU number and memory for custom constrained compute offering or without predefined CPU number, CPU speed and memory for custom unconstrained compute offering. \r\n\r\nTo allow the user to set CPU number, CPU speed and memory during VM deployment, UI form for VM deployment has been modified to provide controls to change these values.

Description\r\n**Problem**: Instance settings tab is visible only for stopped VMs but hidden otherwise. This creates confusion as users may not know that VMs need to be stopped to access settings page. Some VM details need to be read-only for the user.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause**: The UI Code hides the settings tab for VMs that are not in stopped state. Instance setting tab should always be visible, but only changeable when VM is stopped. Required instance details are not read-only for the user.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: The settings tab is now always visible for VMs. If VM is not in the stopped state, no interactions are allowed in the settings tab view by greying out its content and a popup is shown to advise users for stopping the VM. VM details can be made read-only in UI for the user using “user.vm.readonly.ui.details” which accepts a comma-separated list of details. For user, read-only details will be shown in the settings tab in UI but the action button for them will be disabled and greyed out. Admin can still update such details.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The metrics view for instances does not show used memory.\r\n**Root Cause**: Used memory was not added as a column in the metrics view for instances.\r\n**Solution**: Metrics view for instances makes ‘listVirtualMachineMetrics’ API call to gather metrics. The response of this API call contains total and free memory with the instance. These have been used to compute used memory as a percentage of total memory and displayed as a new column in UI. Also fixes\r\na bug for VMware, due to which incorrect memory usage was returned.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Not able to configure a sort order for the zones that are listed in various views in the UI.\r\n\r\n*Root Cause:* There is no mechanism to accept sort key for existing zones or UI widget, that would allow to listing zones in the UI in a certain order.\r\n\r\n*Solution*: The order of zones in listed in various views in the UI can now be configured through the newly added “sort_key” field added for the zone. It can be set using updateZone API by providing “sort_key” parameter for a zone, or by reordering the items in the zones list in the UI. UI has been updated to show ordering controls in zones list view. Database changes include updating table “data_center” by adding “sort_key” column (containing integer values and defaults to zero).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

CloudStack users want the ability to share templates with other accounts or projects through the UI.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause: The ‘updateTemplatePermissions’ is only available via API and needs to be integrated with the UI in order to allow users to share templates with other accounts within the same domain, and also with projects that the sharing account has access to.\r\n\r\nSolution: The CloudStack UI template view has been extended to include a button that allows users to update template permissions through the ‘updateTemplatePermissions’ API. This API supports 3 operations i.e. add, remove or reset. The reset operation does not require any parameters and it simply removes all permissions for a template. The add and remove parameters require either accounts or projects to be specified for sharing or stop sharing templates. The ‘listAccounts’ API has been extended to allow users to see all the accounts within the same domain if the global setting ‘allow.view.all.domain.accounts’ is set to true. This allows the accounts selection to be a multi-selection.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The current template was only shared with bt2 by bt1 so dropdown menu only shows accounts that the current template has been shared with.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19572501/53581135-b3846c00-3b85-11e9-96d8-a6e0f85a776b.png)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Create 2 Accounts (acc1 and acc2) within the same domain.\r\n- Log in to the CloudStack UI with acc1 user account and upload a private template for this user.\r\n- Navigate to the newly created UI and click on the \"Update Template Permissions\" button.\r\n- A new window should pop up, select \"Add\" for this window and input acc2 in the Accounts input field and then click OK.\r\n- With CloudMonkey/CloudStack UI, check for shared templates using acc2 user account. The template from acc1 user account should now be visible to acc2 under shared templates.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->","created_at":"2019-03-28T09:42:16Z","updated_at":"2019-07-18T16:48:15Z","closed_at":"2019-07-18T16:42:56Z","merged_at":"2019-07-18T16:42:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d8157422dbbcacc66543185544c00eb2bb49c3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/8/labels","id":3740792,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzc0MDc5Mg==","number":8,"title":"4.13.0.0","description":"Milestone for PRs targetted the next LTS release 4.13.","creator":{"login":"rafaelweingartner","id":4129005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjkwMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4129005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelweingartner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelweingartner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":248,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-10-15T18:39:41Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T15:43:10Z","due_on":"2019-08-12T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-09-02T07:42:56Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/3241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/3241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/3241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/e90bad4740f9826cd78e3386f136cf09ec686b4d","head":{"label":"shapeblue:allow-ui-template-sharing","ref":"allow-ui-template-sharing","sha":"e90bad4740f9826cd78e3386f136cf09ec686b4d","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack","description":"The upstream repository is at http://github.com/apache/cloudstack.

Description\r\nBefore this fix, there were two possible scenarios when cancelling maintenance/prepare for maintenance on a KVM host:\r\n- If global setting 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = true, then the management server performed SSH into the host and restarted the CloudStack agent service.\r\n- If global setting 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = false, then the management server required that the CloudStack agent service on the host was restarted manually, for the host to become operational again. Restart was to establish a new connection between management server and the host agent, as it was closed after the host is notified to be put into maintenance\r\n\r\nAfter cancelling maintenance on one-time SSH password hosts, hosts did not reconnect and were not operational unless a manual restart on the CloudStack agent service was performed.\r\n\r\nThis feature keeps the connection between management server and host agent alive while preparing for maintenance and when on maintenance. This imples that:\r\n- Host agent is connected during maintenance period unless it is stopped\r\n- If the host or the agent are restarted during maintenance period, a new connection will be established between the agent and the management server.\r\n- If a host agent is connected to the management server when cancelling maintenance, then the current connection is kept alive regardless the value of the global setting 'kvm.ssh.to.agent'\r\n- If a host agent is disconnected when cancelling maintenance:\r\n   - If 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = true, then the management server restarts the agent service via SSH into the host\r\n   - If 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = false, then an error is thrown indicating that the agent must be connected to the management server.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n- When an admin cancels maintenance mode on a KVM host:\r\n   - If 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = false and the agent is connected then maintenance mode is cancelled, then maintenance mode is cancelled.\r\n   - If 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = true and the agent is connected, then maintenance mode is cancelled.\r\n   - If 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = true and the angent is not connected, then the management server will attempt to SSH into the host and restart the agent. If the agent connects, then maintenance mode is cancelled. If the agent still does not connect then maintenance mode fails to be cancelled and a suitable message is returned.\r\n   - If 'kvm.ssh.to.agent' = false and the agent is not connected, then maintenance mode fails to be cancelled and a suitable message is returned\r\n- A host must be able to exit maintenance under the following circumstances:\r\n   - Host agent has remained online throughout the maintenance period\r\n   - Host agent has been restarted after host went into maintenance\r\n   - KVM host has been fully restarted during the maintenance period\r\n- A host in maintenance mode and with agent connected must be shown to remain connected to CloudStack management whilst rejecting all CloudStack operations (new internal agent state = hostInMaintenance)\r\n- Hosts in which SSH is allowed (kvm.ssh.to.agent = true) must be able to still exit maintenance mode regardless of whether the host or agent have been restarted during the maintenance period. (i.e. no regressions to existing functionality)\r\n- Hosts in maintenance mode which have either or both the host itself or the host agent restarted should be reconnected to management server with the management server agent in the new internal hostInMaintenance state\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Admins don’t want to charge for IP address usage on certain (shared) networks.\r\nRoot Cause: There is no flag or detail for admins to provide using UI or API when creating networks to specify if they want IP address usage of the network hidden.\r\nSolution: A new boolean hideipaddressusage flag is added to the createNetwork API and a checkbox in the ‘Add guest network’ UI for the root admins to specify if they want the shared network’s IP address usage to be hidden in the listUsageRecords API response. The provided flag is saved as the ‘hideIpAddressUsage’ detail in the cloud.network_details table for the network. For existing (shared) networks, root admins can also specify the same boolean API parameter hideipaddressusage with the updateNetwork API request to configure the behaviour for an existing network. When the detail/flag is true, the IP address usage for the (shared) network is not exported in the listUsageRecords API response. The listNetworks API response will include the details of a network for root admin only. (note usage is still recorded in the usage database but not return by the listUsageRecords API)\r\n\r\nThe API flag works for any kind of network via the API, but the checkbox is only shown while creating shared networks in the UI.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\nThis adds a new API arg only accessible to admins to specify if they\r\nwant the network's ip address usage hidden. This then saves this setting\r\nin the network_details table for a network, and the listUsageRecords\r\nAPI response creator checks for an IP address if it needs to be exported\r\nor skipped/hidden.\r\n\r\nThe setting is available only to root admin via the listNetworks API response (details key).\r\nRoot admin can also update existing networks by using updateNetwork API and passing `hideipaddressusage=true|false`\r\n\r\nUI screenshot, that adds this checkbox only for admins creating a shared

other kinds of networks to have their ip address usages skipped as well, available via the

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n1. Implemented [DMTF's CADF event model](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf) for event logging.\r\n2. Deleting events from CS control panel is now an event itself\r\n3. Proposed a naming convention for the events in order to follow the pattern Resource.Action\r\n\r\nNo database changes were made. No functionality of any existing feature is touched. A config option would be nice to be added in the future in order to enable or disable cadf logging.\r\n\r\nreplace.properties files where touched to set the event log filename (\"event.log\") and client/log4j-cloud.xml.in was configured to append logs to the correct file.\r\n\r\nCADF was implemented as part of my Msc thesis on Cloud Forensics - Log Unification - the CADF Case\r\n\r\nCADF model is a forensics-friendly model that stores event data without providing any information about the underlying hardware or platform. In addition to the existing models that answer 4 Ws \r\n(Who, What, Where, When ) CADF also answers   FromWhere, OnWhat, ToWhere.\r\nBeing a standard (cadf) makes building consumer and carver forensic tools easy as the developer only cares about the event model and not the platform that provided the events.\r\n\r\nI created two top level classes (CADF which is the event record and Resource which represents the CS Resource). Resource mappings were made where necessary.\r\n\r\nAll the required data were collected from the EventVO in ActionEventUtils.java and ApiServlet.java.\r\nThe full model implementation would require to touch 352 events (if I counted them correctly)  \r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n**Problem**: Currently tags cannot be applied to snapshot when it is being created but through separate “create tags” API calls. For snapshot policies tags cannot be set either at creation or through “create tags” API.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause**: The “create snapshots” API does not support adding tags during creation and it can only be done through “create tags” API. Snapshot policy as a resource does not support tags and no tags can be set for them through any API.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Tag support for snapshot policy has been added. Snapshot policy with tags when executed will produce snapshots containing the same tags from snapshot policy.\r\n\r\nFollowing APIs have been updated:\r\n- Both “create snapshotpolicy” and “create snapshot” now accepts “tags” as a new parameter. The expected format for “tags” parameter is similar to parameter “tags” in “create tags“ API.\r\n- Deletion support for tags associated with snapshots policy has been added to “delete snapshotpolicies” API.\r\n- Tags set for snapshot policies are added to the Response of “list snapshotpolicies“ API.\r\n\r\nUI support for setting tags to snapshots and snapshot policy is provided through the corresponding menus with a new section in each form to set tags.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nProblem: The listVolumeMetrics API response does not honor the volume detail visibility restrictions set for normal users and returns sensitive information which should only be visible to the root admin.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause: The listVolumeMetrics API response extends the ListVolumesByAdmin API internally and this results in a full display view response that is only meant for the root admin.\r\n\r\nSolution: This has been fixed by rectifying the API response to not show ‘physical size’, 'storage type', and ‘storage pool’ information. The UI has also been fixed to hide these columns for normal users.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n- Introduces a new Global Setting `allow.user.view.all.domain.accounts` that allows admins to control whether users can see other accounts within the same domain through the ListAccounts API.\r\n\r\n- Also extends the ‘updateTemplatePermissions’ by integrating it with the UI in order to allow users to share templates with other accounts within the same domain, and also with projects that the sharing account has access to.\r\n\r\nThe updateTemplatePermissions API supports 3 operations i.e. add, remove or reset. The reset operation does not require any parameters and it simply removes all permissions for a template. The add and remove parameters require either accounts or projects to be specified for sharing or stop sharing templates.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The current template was only shared with bt2 by bt1 so dropdown menu only shows accounts that the current template has been shared with.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19572501/53581135-b3846c00-3b85-11e9-96d8-a6e0f85a776b.png)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Create 2 Accounts (acc1 and acc2) within the same domain.\r\n- Log in to the CloudStack UI with acc1 user account and upload a private template for this user.\r\n- Navigate to the newly created UI and click on the \"Update Template Permissions\" button.\r\n- A new window should pop up, select \"Add\" for this window and input acc2 in the Accounts input field and then click OK.\r\n- With CloudMonkey/CloudStack UI, check for shared templates using acc2 user account. The template from acc1 user account should now be visible to acc2 under shared templates.\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing

A VM fails to start, which has a VM snapshot after performing the extractVolume operation on the stopped VM.\r\n**Root Cause**: While downloading a volume of a stopped VM, it creates a worker VM with the volume attached and it creates a temporary snapshot, and then it creates another worker VM cloned from that snapshot and exports an OVA file and deletes the cloned worker VM. Afterward, it deletes the initial worker VM and the temporary snapshot which merges any previous snapshot(s) to the main disk. So, while starting the VM, VMware is not able to find the snapshot disk.\r\n**Solution**: Export the volume using a single worker VM (when VM is stopped) without creating a temporary snapshot.\r\n**Upgrade Notes**: After the upgrade, the admin should replace the live systemvm ISO file in all secondary storage pools with the new systemvm.iso on the management server (keeping the original name which the original systemvm.iso had on secondary storage). Finally, admin should destroy all the old SSVMs.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

The keyboard list in the UI is not consistent across views such as in the instance wizard and in the register template form. There is also no way to custom about url/text and doc title and help URL in the UI.\r\n**Root Cause**: The list is hardcoded in the UI allowing no centralised configuration.\r\n**Solution**: Introduce a new `config.js` file installed at the `/usr/share/cloudstackmanagement/webapp/config.js` location. The config.js allows configurable keyboard list, about url/text, doc title,  and help URL.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

When a multi-disk OVA template is uploaded, only the root disk is recognized and VMs deployed using such template only get the root disk provisioned.\r\n**Root Cause**: The template processor for multi-disk OVA was not used in the template upload processor.\r\n**Solution**: Added support for local multi-disk OVA template upload. After a multi-disk OVA template is\r\nuploaded, the mechanism that worked on multi-disk OVA templates registered using URL is now also used to discovers and creates data-disk templates in `cloud.vm_template` table and on the secondary storage.\r\n\r\nTo enable SSL on SSVMs :\r\n• Upload the certificates like you usually do via the API or UI->Infrastructure tab\r\n• Set the global settings secstorage.encrypt.copy, secstorage.ssl.cert.domain to appropriate values\r\nalong with the CPVM ones\r\n• Restart management server (no need to destroy/restart SSVM (or the ssvm agent))\r\n\r\nTest cases:\r\n- Upload template and check it creates multi-disk folders on secondary\r\n  storage and entries in cloud.vm_template table\r\n- Upload template and kill/shutdown management server. Then restart MS\r\n  to check if template sync works\r\n- Copy template across zone of an uploaded template\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Rohit Yadav <rohit.yadav@shapeblue.com>\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nThis Pull Request enables a global setting for MTU size . The given value in the global settings will be added to customize all MTU values the MTU interface (see libvirt XML - https://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html#elementsConnect).\r\n\r\nFirst of all we implemented a change for each single nic of a vm. We observed that this is not useful because Linux Bridges / OpenvSwitch with Libvirt always configures bridge network interface MTU\r\nto use the lowest MTU of all ports (devices) on the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe only useful way to bypass this problem is to set the MTU to the same size for all VMs.\r\n\r\nWe introduced a global setting. \r\n`kvm.mtu.size` `Set the MTU for Libvirt and KVM (if not set the default MTU will be considered, Attention: If you use OVS the main bridge automatically is adjusted to the guest nic mtu)`\r\n\r\nif this is not set nothing will happen. after set a value it will be set for all virtual machines.\r\n\r\n**We tested it in production in our KVM environment.**\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis is in reference to https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3041 . I removed the `Collection.shuffle()` and replaced it with `Collection.sort()`, the idea being that instead of introducing the size of volume as a query parameter, we can just iterate through an already sorted list, based on available size per image store. We iterate through the sorted list, querying if disk usage per image store has exceeded 90%. This eliminates the possibility of there being another location in the zone with more disk space and not being selected as referenced in this issue ( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-2919 ). Also included in this commit is the method `imageStoreCurrentCapacity` that checks remaining capacity per imagestore.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: @kioie <kioieddy@google.com>\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

allows computers with Windows or MacOS to run the tests without scanning for `/proc/meminfo` path.\r\n\r\nAt the class [MemStat.java](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/c496c84c6c727a84862cbbe2d870ff57939488b4/plugins/hypervisors/kvm/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/utils/linux/MemStat.java#L71), the `refresh()` method (called in MemStat constructor) has the following lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void refresh() {\r\n        File f = new File(MEMINFO_FILE);\r\n        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(f,\"UTF-8\")) {\r\n            parseFromScanner(scanner);\r\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"File \" + MEMINFO_FILE + \" not found:\" + ex.toString());\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen executing `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(f,\"UTF-8\")` it scans the file _MEMINFO_FILE_ (`/proc/meminfo`); however, if the OS running this test is not a Linux then it throws `FileNotFoundException`, failing the test.\r\n\r\nThus, by Mocking the Scanner constructor, the `new Scanner(f,\"UTF-8\")` execution returns the desired Scanner.\r\n\r\n##

the  `<iotune> ... </iotune>` section in the XML.\r\n\r\n@rhtyd @mike-tutkowski @wido @DaanHoogland @nvazquez @kiwiflyer @rafaelweingartner do any of you guys know a reason for keeping the conditional

Description\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce:**\r\n1. Select one entry in a multiSelect listView (e.g. instance list) and then deselect it again. Now click on the \"select all\" checkbox. The entries which were clicked previously are not displayed as selected.\r\n\r\n2. Select at least one entry. Use the multiSelectAction buttons to trigger an action. Wait for completion. The list refreshes and no entry is selected but the multiSelectAction buttons are displayed.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n1. Use \"checked\" property instead of the attribute to select all entries. This is necessary because when you checked an entry by clicking on it the property gets set and the browser is preferably using this. So setting the attribute by clicking on the \"select all\" checkbox had no impact anymore on the checkBox of the previously clicked entries. \r\n\r\n2. Hide the multiSelectAction buttons when the list is refreshed after an action is performed and no element is selected anymore.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that

The added code is then executed, copying the template to the target host/primary storage; after migrating the template, the execution flows keep as it was previously and the migration is succesfull.\r\nAdditionally, table `template_spool_ref` is correctly updated with the template reference matching with the target storage pool.\r\n- [x] Successfully migrated a VM in the case where both storage pools (source and destiny host) have the VM template.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

Description\r\nWhen requesting a secondary IPv6 address the address specified by the requester should not be a EUI-64 (SLAAC) address.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen by looking at *ff:fe* which is always in the same position in a IPv6 address when using SLAAC/EUI-64.\r\n\r\n<pre>2001:db8:13f:0:1c00:4aff:fe00:fe</pre>\r\n\r\nThat is an IPv6 EUI-64 address for example.\r\n\r\nSee: https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-documents/understanding-ipv6-eui-64-bit-address/ta-p/3116953\r\n\r\n  Extended Unique Identifier (EUI), as per RFC2373, allows a host to assign iteslf a unique 64-Bit IP \r\n  Version 6 interface identifier (EUI-64). This feature is a key benefit over IPv4 as it eliminates the need of manual configuration or DHCP as in the world of IPv4. The IPv6 EUI-64 format address is obtained \r\n  through the 48-bit MAC address. The MAC address is first separated into two 24-bits, with one being \r\n  OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and the other being NIC specific. The 16-bit 0xFFFE is then \r\n  inserted between these two 24-bits for the 64-bit EUI address.

With this fix, the reconnection attempt won't be observed on the management server side. The agent will keep attempting reconnection when certificates are invalid, the cert import script does not need to restart cloud service

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis regression was introduced with PR #2773 (Support IPv6 address in addIpToNic). The contributor did not take into consideration that the method “addIpToNic” was designed to add/allocate other IPs to a NIC. If users did not specify an IP, ACS should generate one for the network where the NIC is plugged into.\r\n\r\nEven though I am fixing this regression here, it is still important to highlight that for IPV6, the user is not able to allocate an IP without specifying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

periodically clear disk cache (depending on memory size)\r\n- only start guest services specific to hypervisor\r\n- use systemvm code to determine hypervisor type (not systemd)\r\n- start cloud service at end of post init rather than through systemd\r\n- reduce initial threads started for httpd\r\n- fix vmtools config file\r\n- disable all required services (do not start on boot)\r\n- start only required services during post init.\r\n- allow one-shot ACS configuration services to terminate after running.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically

steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce memory footprint and improve boot speed/predictability; The following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n- Add vm.min_free_kbytes to sysctl\r\n- periodically clear disk cache (depending on memory size)\r\n- only start guest services specific to hypervisor\r\n- use systemvm code to determine hypervisor type (not systemd)\r\n- start cloud service at end of post init rather than through systemd\r\n- reduce initial threads started for httpd\r\n- fix vmtools config file\r\n- disable all required services (do not start on boot)\r\n\r\nSome changes will require a new systemvmtemplate that can be done in 4.14:\r\n- start only required services during post init.\r\n- allow one-shot ACS configuration services to terminate after running.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes:

Description\r\nOfferings can co-exist where on does provide Security Grouping in the\r\nnetwork, but other guest Networks have no Security Grouping.\r\n\r\nIn V(X)LAN isolation environments the L2 separation is handled by V(X)LAN\r\nand protection between Instances is handled by Security Grouping.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple scenarios possible where one network has Security Grouping\r\nenabled because that is required in that network.\r\n\r\nIn the other network, but in the same zone it could be a choice to have\r\nSecurity Grouping disabled and allow all traffic to flow.\r\n\r\n## Types of
