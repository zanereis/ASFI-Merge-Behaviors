noticed that the java command fails when using long classpaths on windows, while the classpath also has entries that contain spaces.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the manifest in the pathing jar uses space as a separator between classpath entries, and entries aren't URI-encoded. A classpath entry with a space in it is incorrectly treated as 2 entries.\r\n\r\nPR is for an older revision, as we use buildr 1.4 internally. It should be easy enough to merge though, as it's a one-liner

have a very small patch for supporting excludegroups in TestNG (something we desperately need in order to move from Maven to Builder). Passing the excludegroups via :properties does not work as this param is not meant to be a -D arg (which is how it seems all the key/value pairs in properties are added), but is a command line argument to org.testng.TestNG. I could not find if there were anyone else who had solved this issue or if there was a JIRA -- so I assumed it just hadn't come up yet. This should probably be extended to support all the options for running TestNG (http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#running-testng), but this was by far the most necessary for our needs. If deemed OK, I'd be willing to add support for all the options in a similar manner.
