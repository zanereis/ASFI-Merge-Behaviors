sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3997\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix default so `None` works as default value for the get method. \r\n\r\nThis will not change existing regular functions in the `Variable` class (unless the redundant `default_var=None` is used). If\r\nvariable `foo` doesn't exist:\r\n```\r\nfoo = Variable.get(\"foo\")\r\n    -> KeyError\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor passing `default_var=None` to get, `None` is returned instead:\r\n```\r\nfoo = Variable.get(\"foo\", default_var=None)\r\nif foo is None:\r\n    handle_missing_foo()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n* Test `None` as default, and throw when no default is provided\r\n* Test the current behaviour for missing variables for the `get` function to raise a `KeyError`\r\n* Use `None` as default value in the `setdefault` method\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\nDescribe the default_var parameter with a `None` value in the doc, in the get variable examples section.

Making it `ln -f` so that it does not fail with:\r\n```\r\n+ ln -s /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys2\r\nln: failed to create symbolic link '/home/airflow/.ssh/authorized_keys2': File exists\r\nERROR: InvocationError for command '/app/scripts/ci/1-setup-env.sh' (exited with code 1)\r\n______________________________________________ summary _______________________________________________\r\nERROR:   py27-backend_sqlite-env_docker: commands failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen looking for configurations via commands, airflow can now look at environment variables to find the command.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_command_from_env\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-01T20:52:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T15:27:04Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:27:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cac6a211499c5c3a89b68be013c281e5644827e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

which made it difficult to use it.  It is worth adding that I used the glob to create a table of contents for operators for GCP.  Adding a new service is just adding a new file.\r\n\r\nIn the next step I would like to expand the `docs/howto/operator/gcp/index.rst` file. This file should contain information about the prerequisites to use operators.\r\n\r\nPreview: http://well-to-do-action.surge.sh/\r\n\r\nCC: @ashb \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3982\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIf a DagRun does not have the same tasks as its DAG (e.g. a task is added or removed later), it should update its state based on its tasks rather than the DAG's.\r\n\r\nThis is probably mostly relevant when (a) adding a task to a DAG with a different start date and then (b) clearing a past DAG Run.\r\n\r\nNote that this CR also removes the adhoc task references.  The code path that led to this bug is attempting to exclude adhoc tasks, which don't exist anymore as of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/1667.  I've removed other references for consistency.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSchedulerJobTest.test_dagrun_root_after_dagrun_unfinished\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2511/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-2511\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2511\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn 1.10.2, when running Subdags using the k8s executor (and possibly\r\nothers) a common problem which can arrise is an issue of Deadlocks\r\naround a transactional update to the database when updating the task\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nAs a measure to mitigate this, we have implemented a catch to swallow\r\nthe OperationalError (if raised) and automatically perform a\r\nsession.rollback().  By doing this, we can continue with the Sundag.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that this isn't the most ideal solution to this issue, and we\r\nare being quite general in regards to rolling back on an\r\nOperationalError exception, but as sqlalchemy doesn't give a specific\r\nerror code relating to the specifics of a Deadlock, and as Postgresql\r\nand MySQL return a different error code and string when faced with the\r\nsame error, it could lead to some fairly db-specific exception catches\r\nin the code.\r\n\r\nWe did also toy with the idea of using a retry loop, and utilising the\r\nsession.begin_nested() function to create a SAVEPOINT, but this is not\r\nsupported by all setups, so may lead to further unwanted complications\r\ndepending on setup.\r\n\r\nI'm open to ideas/suggestions on further investigations of this issue,\r\nand whether we should be handling this error elswehere.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nOther than manually creating a deadlock within the airflow meta database, and the infrequent occurance of this issue, we've not implemented a method to test this.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe current LatestOnlyOperator will skip all downstream tasks blindly. However, the doc shows it will respect trigger rules which is a wrong behavior. \r\nIt also shows an incorrect example of the interaction between skipped tasks and trigger rules in schedule level. I replace it with other examplesusing BranchingOperator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo test needed because its changes on documentation.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3659\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMe and @antonimaciej  do a few activities: \r\n1. We created a new operators:\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceJobDeleteOperator`\r\n    Deletes a transfer job.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceJobCreateOperator`\r\n    Creates a transfer job.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceJobUpdateOperator`\r\n    Updates a transfer job.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceOperationCancelOperator`\r\n    Cancels a transfer operation.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceOperationGetOperator`\r\n    Gets a transfer operation.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceOperationPauseOperator`\r\n    Pauses a transfer operation\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceOperationResumeOperator`\r\n    Resumes a transfer operation.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GcpTransferServiceOperationsListOperator`\r\n    Gets a list of transfer operations.\r\n1. We created a new sensor: \r\n`airflow.contrib.sensors.gcp_transfer_operator.GCPTransferServiceWaitForJobStatusSensor`\r\n    Waits for at least one operation belonging to the job to have the\r\n    expected status.\r\n\r\n1. We refactored old operators:\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator`\r\n    Copies objects from a Google Cloud Storage bucket to another bucket.\r\n`airflow.contrib.operators.gcp_transfer_operator.S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator`\r\n    Synchronizes an S3 bucket with a Google Cloud Storage bucket.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nSystem tests for operators and unit test for hooks and operators\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3968\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is one of the PR series aimed to add automatically API Reference.\r\n\r\n- [AIRFLOW-XXX][1/3] Syntax docs improvements - https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4789\r\n- [AIRFLOW-3968][2/3] Refactor base GCP hook -  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4790\r\n- [AIRFLOW-3811][3/3] Add automatic generation of API Reference  - https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4788\r\n\r\nI would ask you to accept changes in order.\r\n\r\nDocumentation preview with all changes is available: \r\nhttp://neighborly-sun.surge.sh/autoapi/index.html\r\n\r\nThe proposed PR introduces various changes related to GoogleCloudBaseHook:\r\n\r\n- Move all decorators to top-level of module.  \r\n   There were two ways to place decorations in the file: \r\n  1. as a static method on GoogleCloudBaseHook\r\n  2. as a static method on nested class _Decorators in class GoogleCloudBaseHook. \r\n\r\n  In my opinion, the applied level of nesting is unjustified.\r\n  This is also indicated in Google's code style guide: http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#217-function-and-method-decorators\r\n- Create property `scope` to separate complex logic from the `get_credentials` method. \r\n  This allows us to test the code in isolation. Tests have been added.\r\n- Simplify logic of `fallback_to_default_project_id`. \r\n  The logic of the method has been unnecessarily complicated.  The helper method used was used deleted. There have been added tests to check the code's logic.\r\n- Some code fragment did not follow the line width rule.\r\n- Use `@decoractor` syntax. \r\nThe old syntax is not supported by [autoapi](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@airflow.apache.org:lte=5M:).\r\n- preserve the state of the environment variable after execution of `provide_gcp_credential_file` decorator.\r\n- remove constant `_G_APP_CRED_ENV_VAR`\r\n- some tests were dependent on the database. I added a mock. In the future I will try to fix the constructor. It should not connect to the database\r\n\r\nCC: @kaxil @fenglu-g\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-27T10:04:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T10:17:19Z","closed_at":"2019-08-12T10:17:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e46a0e4cfb1e175eb2a3acb46205869b7bf38d3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

automatically API Reference.\r\n\r\n- [AIRFLOW-XXX][1/3] Syntax docs improvements - https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4789\r\n- [AIRFLOW-3968][2/3] Refactor base GCP hook -  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4790\r\n- [AIRFLOW-3811][3/3] Add automatic generation of API Reference  - https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4788\r\n\r\nI would ask you to accept changes in order.\r\n\r\nDocumentation preview with all changes is available: \r\nhttp://neighborly-sun.surge.sh/autoapi/index.html\r\n\r\nThe library of [autoapi](https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx-autoapi) was used to build it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNo applicable\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3967\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe current state is unexpected because:\r\n\r\n* When Javascript is generated by the template engine, we do metaprogramming, which raises the complexity of the problems.\r\n* It does not allow testing the code in isolation.\r\n* Jinja is a HTML Template Engine. Using it to the JS code may cause a security risk.\r\n\r\nAs a next step, I would like to:\r\n* move the JS code to separate file\r\n* introduce linting for all JS/HTML files. \r\n* extract inlined CSS  to separate file\r\n\r\nFor a long-term goal, I would like to \r\n* introduce visual regression and snapshot testing. If the JS code will be in separate files then it will be relatively simple. \r\n* update a dependency - Bootstrap 4 including dropping glyphicons\r\n\r\n@jmcarp  I saw that you changed HTML / JS files recently. What do you think about the change and plans for the future? Does what I want to do in the future make sense for you?\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-27T09:05:17Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T17:48:18Z","closed_at":"2019-11-27T17:48:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e2f84da2a5a82c83c0ff70ae68f7c469e9b8404","assignee":{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\nReported on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3965\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nGoogleCloudStorageToBigQueryOperator class does not accept \"location\" parameter and for jobs that are not \"US\", \"EU\" will fail.\r\n\r\nTo be more precise, the BigQuery job itself will still work, however the task instance will mark as error because it isn't able to fetch the job status (HTTP 404). Setting the location parameter will fix this problem.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nDoes not need testing, as the same parameter is already used by many other GCP connection classes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-27T03:34:58Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T15:29:14Z","closed_at":"2019-09-30T15:28:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"914d5d8542ed16b87ba492de21372b38fc31cf1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2511\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe bug is caused by improper clean up of failed session commit. This PR pulls out the per-task db manipulations within its own session through provide_session decorator. In the event a single commit fails, the decorate will ensure the session is properly flushed and closed. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis PR passes the tests.test_jobs unit test. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Description\r\n\r\nTraditionally, Airflow runs a dag at the end of each interval, since it was designed to run ETL jobs. This differs from cron and causes some confusion and limitation. Specifically when a job is intended to run at an exact time. This is an attempt to add a flag to have Airflow run a dag at exactly the scheduled time. For exam ple, if the a cron string such as `0 0 * * 1-5` is used, the Friday's job is executed on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

when user clicks a page to which he/she doesn't have access, there will be a \"Access is Denied\" flash message.\r\n\r\nBut for the DAG-level access control: when the user clicks a DAG to which he/she doesn't have access, he/she would be redirected to the main page WITHOUT any flash message. This may be confusing to the user.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds proper flash warning message in the UI for this. Users will see flash message \"**DAG-level access is denied**\" when they click on a DAG to which he/she doesn't have \"can_dag_view\"/\"can_dag_edit\" permissions.\r\n\r\n![alt

title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3945\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen creating new permission views in AirflowSecurityManager.create_custom_dag_permission_view in the file airflow/www/security.py, the list of permission views to update might be empty because everything is still up to date. In that case, a row in which only the id is not NULL will still be inserted in table ab_permission_view_role every time.\r\n\r\nThis is a minor bug when using PostgreSQL. When using a SQL Server backend, this causes the webserver to crash as SQL Server disallows multiple NULLs in a unique constraint (by default).\r\n\r\nMy PR\r\n  * Fixes this bug\r\n  * Adds a test for it\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI added a test which checks that the number of records in table ab_permission_view_role remains the same when running sync_roles() twice in succession. It fails before my changes and passes after my changes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3940\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMigrate this plugin from Flask-Admin to Flask-AppBuilder. I tested the\r\nplugin by:\r\n\r\n1. Creating a dummy table named `foo` with a single column in a local Hive cluster\r\n2. Configuring the connections `metastore_default` (Thrift) and `metastore_mysql` (MySQL)\r\n3. Symlink `airflow/contrib/plugins/metastore_browser/` to `$AIRFLOW_HOME/plugins/`\r\n\r\n![Screencast of usage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1173394/53291981-9f4d0300-3770-11e9-978d-5c540b2fe1e9.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to automate this tests, but I decided not to invest the\r\neffort given that there's some discussion of removing this plugin\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes

answer why 'raise e' was commented:\r\n1. This `try-except` is inside method `execute_work()` & there are other operations after the try-except as well as after invoking this method. Raising exception here will prevent all following steps from taking place properly.\r\n2.

Jira\r\n* My PR addresses the following https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3607 and references them in the PR title\r\n* Decreasing scheduler delay between tasks\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n* The delay between tasks can be a major issue, especially when we have dags with many subdags,\r\n  figures out that the scheduling process spends plenty of time in dependency checking,  we took the\r\n  trigger rule dependency which calls the db for each task instance,  we made it call the db just once for\r\n  each dag_run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n* My pr uses very basic parts of the code and also has a fall back to the original behaviour, the ci covers most of the logic and cases that might happen already, I added a unit/integration test that checks the function that has most of the new logic \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n* removed unnecessary queries  - run on each dag run instead of each ti\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nno need for new docs\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n* Passes `flake8`\r\n* Tested in production environment for 3 days\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nThe tests was made on a heavily multitasks dag (35 tasks).\r\nThe tasks don't do any db queries\r\n\r\n**On local environment**\r\nbefore changes:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 4.22 sec\r\n- number of queries during 10 minutes: 118,879 \r\n\r\nafter collecting dep check queries:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 3.86 sec\r\n- number of queries during 10 minutes: 104,397\r\n\r\nStress test - running the dag for every 10 sec for an hour:\r\nbefore changes: \r\n- avg delay between tasks: 16.7 sec\r\n- number of queries: 943,230\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 3.28 sec\r\n- number of queries: 734,563\r\n\r\n**On production environment**\r\nbefore changes:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 2.45 sec\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 2.16 sec\r\n\r\nStress test - running with 150 other dags:\r\nbefore changes: \r\n - avg delay between tasks: 6.3 sec\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n - avg delay between tasks: 4.74 sec\r\n\r\n### Edit\r\nwe recently did a stress test to check this change again with version 1.10.4\r\nwe did the test on a staging like production environment with one dag with 49 tasks that starts once a minute  :\r\n- max delay was decreased by 30%\r\n- db cpu was decreased by 20% \r\n- avg delay was decreased 18%\r\n\r\nThis is a graph of the time delay between two tasks in the dag by time:\r\n- With improvement(first segment): 14:30-16:30\r\n- Without improvement(last segment): 18:10-20:10\r\n<img width=\"770\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 20 47 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6268317/68576601-10575680-0477-11ea-8928-35c210cc903e.png\">\r\n\r\nThis graph shows the db read iops difference which can explain the change  (the times are different because this is in utc)\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-10 at 17 21 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6268317/68578056-f0756200-0479-11ea-9cc0-a4526aa9d648.png)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nThe query that we changed indeed had a dramatic impact on the performance of the scheduler. Reusing db results decreased the delay notably and gave the system chance to recover from stress.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3153\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd 3 stats under the `airflow.dag_processing` namespace. The metric\r\nnames follow the template: `dag_processing.<metric>.<dag_file>`, where\r\n`<dag_file>` is the name of a file in the dag_folder (without the\r\nextension) and `<metric>` is one of the following:\r\n\r\n- `last_runtime`: the number of seconds it took to process the DAG file\r\n  on the most recent iteration\r\n- `last_run.unixtime`: the Unix epoch time (in seconds) at which the DAG\r\n  file was last processed\r\n- `last_run.seconds_ago`: the number of seconds that have elapsed since\r\n  the DAG file was last processed\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI've verified the logging by running the scheduler on the examples DAGs\r\nand logging the value of the gauges with netcat:\r\n\r\n    $ nc -u -l -p 8125 | tr '|' '\\n' | grep dag_processing\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_runtime.example_docker_operator:2.002253\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_run.unixtime.example_docker_operator:1550717832\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_run.seconds_ago.example_docker_operator:18.066831\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_runtime.tutorial:2.001403\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_run.unixtime.tutorial:1550717814\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_run.seconds_ago.tutorial:36.114995\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_runtime.docker_copy_data:2.003188\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_run.unixtime.docker_copy_data:1550717822\r\n      gairflow.dag_processing.last_run.seconds_ago.docker_copy_data:28.097275\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3924\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFix for alert emails sent via email_alert() to have the correct try number\r\nin the body of the text.\r\n\r\nAlert emails are being sent after the state of the Task Instance\r\nis changed from State.RUNNING. This causes self.try_number to be\r\nincremented for the alert email and the first email being sent with\r\n`Try 2 of 1`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdd a test to ensure the first email sent says `Try 1`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-19T23:58:21Z","updated_at":"2019-02-21T16:50:47Z","closed_at":"2019-02-20T05:10:06Z","merged_at":"2019-02-20T05:10:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"de75b7a2bd7f5bef6a1d09942e0b43c17a3fbb95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4739/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4739/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4739/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/86c0d7e70859b9d1a4e86b444a535429e89610ad","head":{"label":"suburbanmtman:bugfix/AIRFLOW-3923-flask-admin-1.5.3","ref":"bugfix/AIRFLOW-3923-flask-admin-1.5.3","sha":"86c0d7e70859b9d1a4e86b444a535429e89610ad","user":{"login":"suburbanmtman","id":2625471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjU0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2625471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman","html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":171567835,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE1Njc4MzU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"suburbanmtman/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"suburbanmtman","id":2625471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjU0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2625471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman","html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suburbanmtman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/suburbanmtman/airflow","description":"Apache

supported export from MySQL in newline-delimited JSON format only. \r\n\r\nAdded support for export in CSV format with the option of specifying a field delimiter.\r\n\r\nThanks to Bernardo Najlis(@bnajlis) for the original PR(#3139).\r\nI made some changes to the the original PR.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2224\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded tests:\r\n * test_init\r\n * test_exec_success_json\r\n * test_exec_success_csv\r\n * test_exec_success_csv_with_delimiter\r\n * test_file_splitting\r\n * test_schema_file\r\nReplaced the pre-existing test with the one @bnajlis wrote as those tests covered that case too.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-19T23:41:05Z","updated_at":"2019-03-06T19:58:07Z","closed_at":"2019-03-06T19:39:20Z","merged_at":"2019-03-06T19:39:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab4d0f6e16b50083f4ab198879bfa93d5f75c873","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4738/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4738/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4738/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/09e9936698e7f953dfd9cc25e2f6ffdcd4d0f4ae","head":{"label":"ttanay:re-airflow-2224","ref":"re-airflow-2224","sha":"09e9936698e7f953dfd9cc25e2f6ffdcd4d0f4ae","user":{"login":"ttanay","id":26265392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY1Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26265392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167679974,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjc2Nzk5NzQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ttanay/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ttanay","id":26265392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY1Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26265392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

Jira\r\n\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3910\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently in `Connection.get_hook()`, a `try-except` clause is used for creating hook based on `conn_id` and `conn_type`. If something goes wrong, it pass silently and return None.\r\n\r\nBut this may cause trouble. Let’s say I’m getting hook from a postgres connection, while package `psycopg2` is not installed. Then getting hook will fail. But it will pass silently, and `None` will be returned as the hook.\r\n \r\nI found this issue when I’m using `SqlSensor` for PostgresSQL. I keep getting error \r\n“**AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_records’**\", but it was very hard to get a clue what caused this error. Similar issues may happen in other cases when `Connection.get_hook()` is invoked.\r\n \r\nSo here we should raise exception explicitly when anything goes wrong in `Connection.get_hook()`, instead of

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###
