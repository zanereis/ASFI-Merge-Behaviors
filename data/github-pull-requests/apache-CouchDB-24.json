Overview\r\n\r\nAfter #1602 we requite env variable `COUCHDB_QUERY_SERVER_JAVASCRIPT` to point to js query server. This patch adds the env var on Makefile's `eunit` target returning ability to run the isolated eunit tests without setting that var in each tests' setup.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIsolated tests with query server, e.g. `make eunit apps=couch_mrview suites=couch_mrview_all_docs_tests` should run locally without throwing \"unknown query server\" exceptions. \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nWe've added a new URL end-point [`/{db}/_design_docs`](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.2.0/api/database/bulk-api.html#db-design-docs) reusing existing function for `_all_docs`. As a result the response for the new handler returns `total_rows` meta set to a total number of docs in a database, not just design docs as indicated in the documentation.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds a custom enumerator for calculating number of ddocs and a new fabric wiring to access it.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nFor isolated tests:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_mrview

Overview\r\n\r\n`os:timestamp()` on Windows only has millisecond accuracy, leading to the failure of 2 mango tests. This closes #1732 by disabling the `execution_time_ms` check on Windows only, since these 2 tests seem to be completing in <1ms and failing the `> 0` check.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the elixir suite by using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`. It's ALWAYS DNS.\r\n\r\nThe bump to `mix.*` was recommended by @davisp in #1730. Closes #1730.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTrust me on this one - or you can build your own Windows instance if you want...\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works

when target document writes failed, because a VDU prevented the\r\nwrite, or it exceed size limits on the target cluster, replication continued\r\nand a `doc_write_failures` statistic counter was incremented. The counter was\r\nvisible in _active_tasks output for continuous replications and was visible in\r\nthe completion record written back to the replication documents.\r\n\r\nThat behavior might not be suitable in many cases. For instance, when migrating\r\ndata, if the counter is ignored by the user, combined with a successful\r\nreplication completion could lead to a perceived data loss. Until recently\r\n00b28c265d97df675b725cd68897dc371cbd7168 this was even worse because on\r\nreplication scheduler would reset statistics counters on every job start. So if\r\na job restarted at least once, user might never find out that all their data\r\ndidn't copy from the source to the target.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a replicator config `stop_on_doc_write_failure = true | false` where\r\nthe replication crashes if a single document write fails. This will many write\r\nfailures visible to the and they would know exactly which document failed and\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nReplications which crash because of doc write failures would retry periodically\r\njust like any other crashes related to missing source or target connectivity,\r\nfor example. They do not fail permanently because users could adjust document\r\nsize limit on a target cluster or change the VDU function and then replication\r\nwill start working again and complete. Here we rely on exponential backoffs\r\nwhich were introduced with the scheduling replicator work. At the maximum\r\nbackoff interval replications would retry about once every 8 hours.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure is handled and bubbles up to the main replication job process,\r\nthere is an attempt to checkpoint before exiting with the error. That is done\r\nin order to reduce change feed reprocessing during each retry attempt.\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n   Will make a separate PR for

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen mango is selecting an index for a query, previously it would consider a field with a $not to be \r\nacceptable to validate a field and increase the chance of that index being selected. That isn't quite correct. It is better to ignore a field and condition that contains a $not. It isn't proof enough that the index is usable for the query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass. Queries using $not should use _all_docs unless more selectors in the query help select an index.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen selecting an index for a mango query, the mango index selector can incorrectly choose an index when a selector has an exists: false for a field in the index along with another condition for that same field. E.g:\r\n\r\nIndex with fields = [\"tags] and selector:\r\n\r\n``` js\r\nSelector: {\r\n    $or: [\r\n      {\r\n        tags: {\r\n          $elemMatch: {\r\n            $eq: \"tag1\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        tags: { $exists: False }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above case, mango will select the index instead of falling back to `_all_docs`.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n* Create similar queries like the above and make sure the index is not selected. \r\n* All Mango tests should pass.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

below:\r\n```\r\n{\"error\":\"badmatch\",\"reason\":\"{badrpc,{'EXIT',{{{badmatch,{error,eacces}},\\n  \r\n```\r\nexpected returned error should like

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nUnder situation where the document is deleted while the mrview index for this document is not updated, the returned value from mrview is `{doc,null}`. There is no such consideration in Mango to cause case_clause error. This fix is to consider out-of-sync between documents in database and their index and not to cause 500 when the `_find` endpoint is called.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocalhost:mytest jiangph$ curl -u foo:bar -X PUT

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR is mostly a refactoring and addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n- Attempt to create a local document with an invalid revision throwing `badarg` exception.\r\n- The documents with `_local` prefix written into a wrong btree on a bulk operation with `new_edits` set to `false`.\r\n- It is possible to create a document with an empty id on a bulk operation with `new_edits` set to  `false`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nNew tests are expected to pass.\r\n\r\nFor manual testing here is an expected change of behaviour:\r\n\r\nReadable error on an invalid rev for a local doc creation\r\n``` \r\ncurl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/_local/alice?rev=0-abcdf -d '{\"name\":\"Alice\"}'\r\n{\"error\":\"error\",\"reason\":\"Invalid rev format\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrect creation of a local doc on a bulk update\r\n```\r\n$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:15984/koi/_bulk_docs -d '{\"new_edits\":false, \"docs\": [{\"_id\":\"_local/alice\", \"_rev\":\"0-1\",

Overview\r\n\r\nOnce in a while we merge a highly experimental features. It is beneficial to be able to have the codepath for these features effectivelly disabled by default until the implementation is stabilized. \r\nThis PR introduces an ability to add feature flag checks for experimental features.   \r\nThis feature is for developers only and wouldn't need documentation.\r\n\r\n### The feature configuration\r\n\r\n```\r\n[feature_flags]\r\n\r\nmy_feature||* = false\r\nmy_feature||mytestdatabaseprefix* = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The `*` is only allowed at the end of the path\r\n- In order to distinguish between shards and clustered db the following convention is used.\r\n  - it is a shard if pattern starts with `/`\r\n- It is also possible to enable multiple flags for the path using alternative syntax\r\n  - `mytestdatabaseprefix* = [my_featureA, my_featureB]`\r\n\r\n### Usage of the feature in the code\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase couch_flags:is_enabled(my_feature, Subject) of\r\n    true -> ...;\r\n    false -> ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere Subject is one of `#db{}` | `#httpd{)` | `#shard{}` | `#ordered_shard{}` | `ShardName :: binary()` | `ShardName :: list()` | `DbName :: binary()` | `DbName :: list()`\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nThere is a naive performance test in the test suite it does 1 million of calls to `is_enabled/2`. One million of calls takes \"1.884 s\" on the laptop.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\nIt is not safe to allow configuration of the feature flags over http since there might be a possibility of injecting arbitrary code via name of the configuration key within `feature_flags` section. Therefore the http access is disabled. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch suites=couch_flags_tests,couch_flags_config\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T14:07:09Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T11:07:27Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T11:07:24Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T11:07:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f12f4c5847a1cfa409c70dbc75b64a4f9e3645a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/e9abe501df4339639f15f34ec7f92528836dda2c","head":{"label":"cloudant:feature_flags2","ref":"feature_flags2","sha":"e9abe501df4339639f15f34ec7f92528836dda2c","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nCode to run a downgrade on a non partitioned database after a cluster has been upgraded to use the new partition code. Currently we cannot downgrade a database that has been created with partitions as the documents will not be where CouchDB would expect. But with this code it would be possible to downgrade a non-partitioned database.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n* Run the unit tests. \r\n* Create databases with the partitioned feature #1605 \r\n* Then switch to this branch. The databases should load.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#1605 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ]

Overview\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new config setting which allows an administrator to configure an initial list of nodes that should be contacted when a node boots up:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[cluster]\r\nseedlist = couchdb@node1.example.com,couchdb@node2.example.com,couchdb@node3.example.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf configured, CouchDB will add every node in the seedlist to the `_nodes` DB automatically, which will trigger a distributed Erlang connection and a replication of the internal system databases to the local node. This eliminates the need to explicitly add each node using the HTTP API.\r\n\r\nWe also modify the `/_up` endpoint to reflect the progress of the initial seeding of the node. If a seedlist is configured the endpoint will return 404 until the local node has updated its local replica of each of the system databases from one of the members of the seedlist. The body of the HTTP response now looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"status\": \"seeding\"\r\n  \"seeds\": {\r\n    \"couchdb@node1.example.com\": {\r\n      \"timestamp\": \"2018-10-16T19:58:03+00:00\",\r\n      \"last_replication_status\": \"ok\",\r\n      \"pending_updates\": {\"_nodes\": 0, \"_dbs\": 101, \"_users\": 42}\r\n    },\r\n    \"couchdb@node2.example.com\": { ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the status flips to \"ok\" the endpoint will return 200 and it's safe to direct requests to the new node.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n- Configure the seedlist for a new 3 node cluster with the names of the 3 nodes and check `/_membership` to confirm that the nodes connect to each other automatically\r\n- On a cluster with lots of databases or users, add a node to the cluster and check that `/_up` returns 404 while the initial internal replication takes place.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that the PR currently has no tests. I wanted to put it up for review while I familiarize myself with the latest bits of the test suite and see what I can contribute.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-16T20:10:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T03:28:49Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T02:40:44Z","merged_at":"2018-11-11T02:40:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"0302e9de73edc94d63c16ed016c6dd666d7ede80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/d102cbcd88364e05684c0089971f87ea79c563d1","head":{"label":"apache:mem3-seedlist","ref":"mem3-seedlist","sha":"d102cbcd88364e05684c0089971f87ea79c563d1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nFor databases generated prior to clustered purge builds, the `db_header` record was changed to below, i.e. with purge_tree and purge_seq_tree.\r\n```\r\n-record(db_header, {\r\n    disk_version = ?LATEST_DISK_VERSION,\r\n    update_seq = 0,\r\n    unused = 0,\r\n    id_tree_state = nil,\r\n    seq_tree_state = nil,\r\n    local_tree_state = nil,\r\n    purge_tree_state = nil,\r\n    purge_seq_tree_state = nil, %purge tree: purge_seq -> uuid\r\n    security_ptr = nil,\r\n    revs_limit = 1000,\r\n    uuid,\r\n    epochs,\r\n    compacted_seq,\r\n    purge_infos_limit = 1000\r\n}).\r\n```\r\nHowever, the disk_version is still not upgraded and this caused mismatch between disk_version and actual `db_header` record, and there is the following error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n**throw:{{invalid_header_size,{db_header,6,1,0,\r\n

version 7 or latest so that it can match the db_header with purge_tree and purge_seq_tree.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides

Update default.ini to set max_lifetime to 10000\r\n2. Restart chttpd application\r\n3. Try manually insert keys into lru_cache and query them. They all should be removed after 10 seconds\r\n```\r\nlists:foreach(fun(Idx) -> ets_lru:insert(chttpd_auth_cache_lru, Idx, [1,2,3]) end, lists:seq(1, 1000)).\r\nlists:filter(fun(Idx) -> ets_lru:lookup(chttpd_auth_cache_lru, Idx) /= not_found end, lists:seq(1, 1000)).\r\n```\r\n4.

Overview\r\n\r\nSometimes it is hard to debug eunit failures. This PR adds an ability to capture logs from the node while running the test case. \r\n\r\nTwo environment variables are added to control the behaviour of the logger.\r\n\r\n- EUNIT_LOG_FILE - to specify the log file\r\n- EUNIT_LOG_LEVEL - the verbosity level. Which MUST be one of:\r\n  - debug\r\n  - info\r\n  - notice\r\n  - warning\r\n  - error\r\n  - critical\r\n  - alert\r\n  - emergency\r\n\r\nIf EUNIT_LOG_FILE is not specified the file backend for logger is disabled.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n  The logger is configured only for test cases which use\r\n  `test_util:start_couch` function. If you want to enable\r\n  the logger for other tests you would need to add\r\n  `test_util:maybe_configure_file_logger()` call to `setup`\r\n  function of the test. You also need to make sure that\r\n  the `config` and `couch_log` apps are running.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Test without configuring logger \r\n  - `make eunit apps=couch`\r\n2. Test with configured log file:\r\n  - `EUNIT_LOG_FILE=test_log.log make eunit apps=couch` - check the test_log.log file\r\n  - `EUNIT_LOG_FILE=/tmp/test_log.log make eunit apps=couch` - check the /tmp/test_log.log file\r\n3. Test with configured log file and level \r\n  - `EUNIT_LOG_FILE=test_log.log EUNIT_LOG_LEVEL=debug make eunit apps=couch`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x]

Overview\r\n\r\nHandle db deletion in couch_db:load_validation_funs\r\n\r\nPreviously there were quite a few problems with load_validation_funs\r\nin the case when clustered database is deleted.\r\n\r\n- the calls to load_validation_funs were failing with `internal_server` error [1]\r\n- the deleted database stayed opened because:\r\n  - the caller of the load_validation_funs (update_doc) stayed alive\r\n  - the main_pid of the deleted database wasn't killed either\r\n- there was an infinite loop in ddoc_cache_entry trying to recover ddoc from deleted database\r\n\r\nThe solution is:\r\n- do not call `recover` for deleted database\r\n- close `main_pid`\r\n- use `erlang:error` to crash the caller\r\n\r\n[1] - The stack trace was:\r\n```\r\n{database_does_not_exist,[\r\n    {mem3_shards,load_shards_from_db,\"bailey/meta\",[\r\n        {file,\"src/mem3_shards.erl\"},{line,394}]},\r\n    {mem3_shards,load_shards_from_disk,1,[\r\n        {file,\"src/mem3_shards.erl\"},{line,369}]},\r\n    {mem3_shards,for_db,2,[\r\n        {file,\"src/mem3_shards.erl\"},{line,54}]},\r\n    {fabric_view_all_docs,go,5,[\r\n        {file,\"src/fabric_view_all_docs.erl\"},{line,24}]},\r\n    {ddoc_cache_entry_validation_funs,recover,1,[\r\n        {file,\"src/ddoc_cache_entry_validation_funs.erl\"},{line,33}]},\r\n    {ddoc_cache_entry,do_open,1,[\r\n        {file,\"src/ddoc_cache_entry.erl\"},{line,294}]}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=couch tests=clustered_db_test\r\nmake eunit apps=ddoc_cache\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x]

replicator session refresh based on cookie max age\r\n\r\nForce couch_replicator_auth_session plugin to refresh the session periodically.\r\nNormally it is not needed as the session would be refreshed when requests start\r\nfailing with a 401 (authentication) or 403 (authorization) errors. In some\r\ncases when anonymous writes are allowed to the database and a VDU function is\r\nused to forbid writes based on the authenticated in username, requests with an\r\nexpired session cookie will not fail with a 401 and the session will not be\r\nrefreshed.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue using these two approaches:\r\n\r\n 1. Use cookie's max-age expiry time to schedule a refresh. To ensure that time\r\n is provided in the cookie, switch the the option to enable it by default. This\r\n handles the issue for endpoints which are updated with this commit.\r\n\r\n 2. For endpoints which do not put a max-age time in the cookie, use a value\r\n that's less than CouchDB's default auth timeout. If users changed their\r\n auth timeout value, and use VDUs in the pattern described above, and don't\r\n update their endpoints to version which sends max-age by default, they could\r\n adjust `[replicator] session_refresh_interval_sec` to their auth timeout minus\r\n some small delay.\r\n\r\nOf course refresh based on auth/authz failures should still works as before.\r\n\r\nFixes #1607\r\n\r\n[x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n[x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n[x] Documentation reflects the changes (comment in default.ini for now, will make a separate docs repo commit)\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-21T17:22:11Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T22:19:37Z","closed_at":"2018-11-26T22:19:34Z","merged_at":"2018-11-26T22:19:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"1347806d2feebce53325070b475f9e211d240ddf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/milestones/4/labels","id":3671233,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzY3MTIzMw==","number":4,"title":"2.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":21,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-19T12:40:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T16:43:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-12-01T04:37:54Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/6ec980fe7d96820bd07147635cc018f0cface00e","head":{"label":"cloudant:forced-refresh-rep-session-plugin","ref":"forced-refresh-rep-session-plugin","sha":"6ec980fe7d96820bd07147635cc018f0cface00e","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Also, there are two newly introduced trees: `PurgeTreeState` and `PurgeSeqTreeState`.\r\n\r\nOnce downgrade function is called, the disk version is back to the latest version of current build. Also, `purge_seq` and `purged_docs` are re-introduced again. \r\n\r\nPS: current PR is based on commit `28ba48da5877a5d471253c1b587af7e3b3121fd9` which doesn't include clustered purge feature.\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue when doing a rolling upgrade of a CouchDB cluster\r\nand adding commit a6bc72e the nodes that were not upgraded yet would\r\nsend through all the docs in the index and those would be passed through\r\nto the user because the co-oridnator would assume it was matched at the\r\nnode level. This adds in a check to see if it has been matched at the\r\nnode level or not. And then performs a match if required.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis is tricky to test. If you have nodes running an older version of CouchDB, this should stop unmatched docs from being returned to the user.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-19T14:13:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T17:20:13Z","closed_at":"2018-09-21T11:53:41Z","merged_at":"2018-09-21T11:53:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"60107992135bc65f69ab8528825a13d36d77b4c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/milestones/4","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb/milestone/4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/milestones/4/labels","id":3671233,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzY3MTIzMw==","number":4,"title":"2.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":21,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-09-19T12:40:51Z","updated_at":"2021-11-04T16:43:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-12-01T04:37:54Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/2d8f276b74e560ebc3c5c29145057e420f1b8d2f","head":{"label":"garrensmith:fix-mango-nodes-selector","ref":"fix-mango-nodes-selector","sha":"2d8f276b74e560ebc3c5c29145057e420f1b8d2f","user":{"login":"garrensmith","id":179458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTQ1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/179458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/garrensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garrensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"52ed7fbf48b953c3cd0dd5c058186a6af01dbc64","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/sub

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature, user-defined partitioned databases.\r\n\r\nA new kind of database can be created with the `?partitioned=true` option. All documents within the database must have document ids of the following format;\r\n\r\n  partition_name:doc_id\r\n\r\nboth partition_name and doc_id must follow the couchdb id format (can't begin with _, etc).\r\n\r\nAll documents with the same partition_name are guaranteed to be mapped to the same shard range. When querying an index, the new `/db/_partition/$partition/_view` endpoint can query the view more efficiently, by only consulting the single shard range holding the partition. This is much more efficient and scales the same way that primary key lookup (GET /dbname/docid) does (approximately linearly).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe PR contains multiple tests for basic functionality and all existing tests  still pass. When testing the PR, it is important to try the feature yourself, interactively, with docs and views of your choosing, to give us confidence in this new feature.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nIn the 1.x era of CouchDB, many parts of the core systems were managed via the config system. This is mostly due to in the early days, no good standard patterns for what Erlang apps looked like were obvious. This has changed now.\r\n\r\nIn addition, being able to change core parts of the database, including what code modules to load when and where, and which OS binaries to run when and where, opened us up to [a](\r\nhttp://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cve/2017-12635.html) [set](\r\nhttp://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cve/2017-12636.html) of [security](\r\nhttp://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cve/2018-11769.html) [vulnerabilities](\r\nhttp://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/cve/2018-8007.html), that we want to close once and for all with this PR by no longer allowing runtime configuration of core system parts.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n  - `daemons`\r\n  - `[httpd] default_handler`\r\n  -`httpd_global_handlers`\r\n  -`httpd_db_handlers`\r\n  -`httpd_design_handlers`\r\n  - `vhost_global_handlers`\r\n  - `redirect_vhost_handler`\r\n  - `os_daemons`\r\n  - `query_servers`\r\n  - `native_query_servers`\r\n\r\nThis patch retains the ability to configure an existing CouchDB installation to, say, add a third party query server, but it’ll require console access to the server and restarting CouchDB from said console.\r\n\r\n* * * \r\n\r\n## Details \r\n\r\nCouchDB ships with two default query_servers (javascript and coffeescript)\r\nas well as one default native_query_server (query aka mango). These used\r\nto be configured in default.ini in these sections:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[query_servers]\r\njavascript = {{prefix}}/bin/couchjs {{prefix}}/share/server/main.js\r\ncoffeescript = {{prefix}}/bin/couchjs {{prefix}}/share/server/main-coffee.js\r\n\r\n; enable mango query engine\r\n[native_query_servers]\r\nquery = {mango_native_proc, start_link, []}\r\n; erlang query server\r\n; erlang = {couch_native_process, start_link, []}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allowed end-users post-install and even runtime-changes to which\r\nquery servers are enabled and where their binaries live.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes things, so only a post-install, but not at-runtime\r\nchanges are possible from now on.\r\n\r\nThis still allows people to configure their CouchDB to run a third-\r\nparty query server like the somewhat popular Python query server,\r\nbut it changes the way the setup is done.\r\n\r\n## Query Servers\r\n\r\nThe javascript and coffeescript query servers continue to be enabled\r\nby default. Setup differences have been moved from default.ini to\r\nthe couchdb and couchdb.cmd start scripts respectively.\r\n\r\nAdditional query servers can now be configured using environment\r\nvariables:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport COUCHDB_QUERY_SERVER_PYTHON=\"/path/to/python/query/server.py with args\"\r\ncouchdb\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the last segment in the environment variable matches the usual\r\nlowercase(!) query language in the design doc `language` field.\r\n\r\nMultiple query servers can be configured by using more environment\r\nvariables.\r\n\r\n## Native Query Servers\r\n\r\nThe mango query server continues to be enabled by default. The erlang\r\nquery server continues to be disabled by default. This patch adds\r\na `[native_query_servers] enable_erlang_query_server = BOOL` setting\r\n(defaults to `\"false\"`) to enable the erlang query server.\r\n\r\nIf the legacy configuration for enabling the query server is detected,\r\nthat is counted as a `true` setting as well, so existing configurations\r\ncontinue to work just fine.\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\nSince the setting of the `./configure` time `PREFIX` happens during\r\n`make release`, I had to adapt the `couchdb` and `couchdb.cmd` scripts\r\nto have the correct env vars set and the `PREFIX` replaced there.\r\n\r\nI did this to the best of my abilities and research, but this needs\r\nreview from the Windows team (Hi Joan! :).\r\n\r\n## OS Daemons\r\n\r\nOS Daemons have been deleted completely as they were deprecated in

Overview\r\n\r\nErlang OTP logs the fact when gen_server behavior crashes. However in case of couch_file the filename is not part of the state. So it is quite hard to figure out what happened given the current log entry format. This PR adds information about filepath to the log entry. Keep in mind though that the filepath value is captured on couch_file:start_link. It is not representing the current file name if file is renamed or moved.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Start couchdb `dev/run --admin=adm:pass`\r\n2. Start remsh session `dev/remsh`\r\n3. Inject failure in one of the couch_file processes (by reading with position greater than the file size) \r\n```\r\n{_Port, Pid, _Fd, _Name} = hd(couch_debug:opened_files()).\r\ncouch_file:pread_binary(Pid, 999999999999999).\r\n```\r\n4.

Description\r\n\r\nOff-heap messages is an Erlang 19 feature:\r\n\r\nhttp://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#process_flag_message_queue_data\r\n\r\nIt is adviseable to use that setting for processes which expect to receive a\r\nlot of messages. CouchDB sets it for couch_server, couch_log_server and bunch\r\nof others as well.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the off-heap behavior could alter the timing of message receives\r\nand expose subtle bugs that have been lurking in the code for years. Or could\r\nslightly reduce performance, so a safety measure allow disabling it.\r\n\r\n### How to test\r\n\r\n```\r\n> erlang:process_info(whereis(couch_server), message_queue_data).\r\n{message_queue_data,off_heap}\r\n\r\n\r\n> config:set(\"off_heap_mqd\",\"couch_server\",\"false\").\r\nok\r\n\r\n> exit(whereis(couch_server), kill).\r\ntrue\r\n\r\n>

Overview\r\n\r\nThere are two separate bugs here being fixed. The first was in `couch_server:terminate/2`. If there was an active open_async process when couch_server died it would throw a function clause when it tried to shutdown the database that wasn't yet open. We just filter out any `#entry{}` record to avoid the issue. This a simple bug but it prevented couch_server from properly generating a SASL report that ended up covering up the second more complex race condition.\r\n\r\nThe second bug has to deal with a race between deletions and opens as well as the state of couch_server's mailbox. There's a very specific set of operations that have to happen in a particular order to trigger this bug:\r\n\r\n1. An in-flight open or creation request that will ultimately succeed. The `'$gen_call'` message must be in couch_server's message queue before Step 2 finishes.\r\n2. A deletion request\r\n3. A second open or creation request that is enqueued before couch_server processes the `'$gen_call'` message from Step 1.\r\n4. The couch_db_updater pid's `'EXIT'` signal is delayed until after the open_result from Step 3 is delivered to couch_server\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue here is that the deletion request clears the `couch_dbs` ets table state without removing the possible corresponding state in couch_server's message queue. As things progress couch_server ends up mistaking the `open_result` message from Step 1 as corresponding to the open_async process spawned in Step 3. Currently this results in the client from Step 3 getting an invalid response from couch_server, and then more importantly, couch_server dies while attempting to process the real `open_result` message because of the state in the `couch_dbs` ets table being incorrect (it would throw a function_clause error in a list comprehension because `#entry.waiters` was undefined).\r\n\r\nThe fix was just to ensure that the opener pid in the `#entry{}` record matches the pid of the caller. Anything that doesn't match is ignored since the deletion already cleaned up the server state. Although we do kill the couch_db_updater pid for extra security, Though technically its duplicating work that the deletion request already handled (via killing the `open_async` pid which is linked to it).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe second of three commits adds a failing test case that is fixed by the third commit.\r\n\r\n`make eunit`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] No documentation to change\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-06T16:35:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T19:46:29Z","closed_at":"2018-09-06T19:12:35Z","merged_at":"2018-09-06T19:12:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f66c734d3c056b6b391f8f8487a7d81c1d55b87f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/1596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/1596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/a2e41a83e1f2921fa0350f2171cc6a88abd54dbe","head":{"label":"apache:fix-couch-server-race-condition","ref":"fix-couch-server-race-condition","sha":"a2e41a83e1f2921fa0350f2171cc6a88abd54dbe","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nIf, when a database is created, it was not possible to create any of\r\nthe shard files, the database cannot be used. All requests return a\r\n\"No DB shards could be opened.\" error.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes fabric_util:get_db/2 to create the shard file if\r\nmissing. This is correct as that function has already called\r\nmem3:shards(DbName) which only returns shards if the database exists.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIt's tricky. You need to have max_dbs_open's worth of files open on all nodes when creating the database. This ensures the _dbs doc is created (as this db is opened at startup and stays open) but none of the shards.\r\n\r\nThe easiest test is as follows;\r\n\r\n1. Create the db\r\n2. stop couchdb (all nodes)\r\n3. delete the .couch files under the 'shards' directory\r\n4. start couchdb\r\n5. try to do anything with the database, get \"No DB shards could be

Overview\r\n\r\nSometimes in operations it is helpful to re-establish connection between\r\nerlang nodes.

Overview\r\n\r\nWe removed a security call in `do_db_req` in apache/couchdb#1246 to avoid duplicate authorization check and as a result there are now no db validation in noop call

This makes it always return a success code, even for the missing databases.\r\n\r\nThis fix places the security check directly in `_ensure_full_commit` call and adds eunit tests for a good
