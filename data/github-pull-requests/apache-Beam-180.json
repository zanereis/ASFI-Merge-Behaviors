Samza and potentially other portable runners who do not use docker and need to run on multi-tenant environment, there is a need to secure the communication between sdk worker and runner. Currently the SSL/TLS in portability is half done.\r\n\r\nHowever, after investigation we found that it's sufficient to just\r\n1. Use loopback address. So that the traffic is not exposed to external network\r\n2. Enforce authentication. So that only the valid users can connect to the ports. \r\n\r\nWith the two steps above, it won't be necessary to enable TLS. Because the data channel is only local and one needs root privilege to eavesdrop the local traffic.\r\n\r\nA trivial way to do authentication is to share a secret token through file system (e.g. set the file permission to be 600, i.e. -rw-------) . Next we introduce a customized interpreter for both the gRPC client and server to provide and verify this token (see GrpcFileTokenAuthProvider.java and token_auth_interceptor.py). The server can then deny any connection attempts that do not have the right token.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

non-portable pipelines, transforms are always scoped by an operator. Metric\r\nnames do not have to be unique across transforms.\r\n\r\nIn portable pipelines, duplicate metric names inevitably occur if no unique\r\nnamespace has been set, due to multiple transforms being fused together inside a\r\nsingle operator.\r\n\r\nThis avoids duplicate metric names by using the transform name as the namespace,\r\nif none has been provided. It is still possible to provide a custom namespace.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

features have been discussed a bit on the mailing list and I get asked about them a bit. I think it is OK to list them here like we list retractions / metadata triggers, both of which are further from reality than checkpoint and drain.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred to do the whole comparison rewrite of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-2888 because the tabular form misleadingly implies these are yes/no features, when in reality they have many facets. But I haven't had time, and haven't convinced anyone else to take on that work.\r\n\r\nSo this is a low-effort compromise.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

latest changes done in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7197 seem to have caused some flakiness on spark runner, see https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Java_ValidatesRunner_Spark/buildTimeTrend\r\n\r\nOf course that static boolean tracking the call to teardown (https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/80e2cef1bcdb7e92bc2f9cf974fc87804cd4b2ad/sdks/java/core/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/ParDoLifecycleTest.java#L290) is bogus.\r\n\r\nThis PR replace this single static var by a map collecting on instances. We expect for every instance which had any lifecycle method invoked that the runner calls teardown.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

standard Go error functionality (`errors.New` and `fmt.Errorf`) to use the newly added Beam \"errors\" package. This PR covers the `core` subdirectory under `sdks/go/pkg/beam`.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the actual changes as straightforward as possible:\r\n\r\n1. If a call isn't wrapping another error, replace it with `New` or `Errorf`. This should be functionally identical.\r\n2. If a call is wrapping another error, replace it with either `Wrap` or `WithContext` using my best judgement. I generally used `Wrap` when the wrapped error originates from third-party code (i.e. any non-Beam package), and I tried to use `WithContext` otherwise.\r\n3. `WithContext` messages make the most sense in present tense (e.g. \"doing foo\", \"reading bar\"). This means I had to adjust some messages slightly, as little as I could without losing any useful information.\r\n4. For existing error messages that combined context and errors, I moved the context part to a separate line using `WithContext`, to improve legibility.\r\n\r\nThis is the last PR for migrating to the new errors package.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

an executable stage has more than one consumer, it currently results in the executable stage being re-computed for each extra consumer. This behavior is undesirable because we are potentially fusing a large amount of work into some executable stages, in addition to thorny problems like side effects (see the [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7131)) which, though not generally encouraged, should not be breaking things so consistently and opaquely.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb @angoenka

`BatchElementsTest.test_no_numpy_regression` and `BatchElementsTest.test_numpy_regression` uses `assertAlmostEqual` with a delta that corresponds to exactly the delta expected due to the random inputs. This means that additional error due to floating point calculations can cause the test to fail non-deterministically.
