The root cause was because the SDK's handling of state api responses didn't check for 0 length byte buffers from the API, and interpret them as the EOF signal.\r\n\r\nIn particular for elements whose coded form is length prefixed, this would yield a 0 length read for a request of 1 byte when calling graph.DecodeVarInt, but no error, preventing subsequent error handling. This would tell the decoder that the encoded size is 0, and it would then read that data accordingly.\r\n\r\nNow when there are 0 length copies and there are no more pages of data, the Read call will immeadiately return EOF rather than defer to the next call, which in the empty case, never comes.\r\n\r\nWhile it's unlikely that runners would ever intentionally return mid stream 0 length reads while saying there is subsequent data, we can't simply end the paging on empty buffers. It's inline with Go's io.Reader interface semantics to permit 0 length reads without error, as like in any short read case, data could be available later, instead of waiting for the full length of the read, and require multiple reads. \r\n\r\nIt's probable that there are places we should be handling the [io.Reader](https://pkg.go.dev/io?tab=doc#Reader) contract more rigorously, such as by always handling the non-zero read bytes even when an error is returned, but care would need to be taken during such a retrofit.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

merge request changes how backlog bytes are reported by KinesisReader.\r\n\r\nInstead of total backlog bytes, which could result in Dataflow pipelines not scaling up,\r\nsplit backlog is now reported.\r\n\r\nThe split backlog size can be over-estimated as it reports the size\r\nof the records across all shards (and also assumes that all shards\r\nin the split have the same progress).\r\nThis can lead to unnecessary decisions to scale up the number of workers\r\nbut will never fail to scale up when this is necessary.\r\n\r\nAlso the watermark policy of the reader is user configurable and we\r\ndon't have a control over it. The calculation of backlog bytes should\r\nalways take into account the time that the record was inserted into\r\nKinesis as this gives accurate results which are independent of\r\ncurrent processing time or any other conditions that reader watermark\r\ncan be using. Therefore a separate, fixed policy is used to track\r\nprocessed records for the backlog calculation.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

are visible in the Flink REST API at the `/accumulators` endpoint, including the Beam Flink runner's custom accumulator, `__metricscontainers`. The value of each accumulator is printed using the accumulator's `toString` method. Previously, `MetricsContainerStepMap::toString` printed some sort of bespoke format. In this PR, I change it to use the JSON representation of the underlying protos so it's easy to parse on the Python side.\r\n\r\nThis implementation ignores `committed` metrics. My understanding is that the Flink runner doesn't support them anyway, so I assume the distinction isn't important here.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

StreamPool synchronized block by excluding stream creation and\r\nrequiring it for release. Some Dataflow pipelines were observing stuck\r\nget and release methods due to stuck stream creation waiting for the\r\nonReady callback. The DirectStreamObserver is modified to additionally\r\npool isReady() to handle cases where blocked threads are blocking the\r\nonReady callback. Additionally as we would prefer to possibly OOM\r\nversus becoming permanently stuck we give up waiting for onReady after\r\na minute.\r\n\r\nThis is a recommit of a reverted commit to allow for testing before\r\nmerging.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

StreamPool synchronized block section to not include stream\r\ncreation which includes sending initial messages. Additionally remove it from being\r\nrequired to release holds. Some pipelines were observing stuck get and\r\nrelease methods on synchronization.  This was due to a stuck stream\r\ncreation waiting for the onReady callback. This could possibly have\r\nbeen due to the callback being queued behind other callbacks on\r\nblocked grpc threads. This was addressed in the DirectStreamObserver\r\nused for the fn api so we reuse it here.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

contains two fixes which are tight to one another:\r\n\r\n    [BEAM-9733] Always let ImpulseSourceFunction emit a final watermark\r\n\r\n    The Flink Runner's ImpulseSourceFunction does not emit a final watermark, unless\r\n    the `--shutdownSourcesOnFinalWatermark` flag has been specified (the flag is\r\n    used in tests to shutdown the pipeline after reading all data). Most pipelines\r\n    will be long-running and thus do not specify the flag.\r\n\r\n    Not sending out the final watermark causes GroupByKey to hold back the data of\r\n    event time windows until the pipeline is shut down (the final watermark is\r\n    always emitted on pipeline shutdown which is why using the above flag works).\r\n\r\n###\r\n\r\n    [BEAM-9733] Make up for timers set while processing the bundle\r\n\r\n    Due to the asynchronous nature of the bundle processing which includes access to\r\n    state and timers, the output watermark can only be advanced after the current\r\n    bundle has finished. Furthermore, we have to take care to only advance it to the\r\n    lowest newly set timer in the finished bundle. Otherwise we would be violating\r\n    the watermark contract.\r\n\r\n    Besides the problem of advancing the output watermark too soon, the current\r\n    model was also overly restrictive with handling the input watermark. The input\r\n    watermark would be pushed back until the end of the bundle. This is not\r\n    necessary as we can advance the input watermark freely during bundle processing\r\n    which can trigger timers as soon as they become eligible for firing. Special\r\n    care has to be taken to handle cleanup timers which may already fire when we\r\n    haven't collected all the timers from the SDK Harness. In case we end up with\r\n    new timers for a window for which the cleanup timer scheduled a cleanup at the\r\n    end of the bundle, we have to defer the cleanup and reschedule the cleanup\r\n    timer. Otherwise, we would lose all state for a timer.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR is adding `SnowflakeIO` with `Read` operation as part of [BEAM-9722](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9722)\r\n\r\nSnowflake is an analytic data warehouse provided as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). It uses a new SQL database engine with a unique architecture designed for the cloud. To read more details please check [here](https://www.snowflake.com ) and [here](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/intro-key-concepts.html).\r\n\r\nThe `SnowflakeIO.Read` uses [Snowflake's JDBC driver](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/jdbc.html) to run [COPY INTO <location>](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-location.html) statement to move data on GCS as CSV files that are then read via `FileIO`.\r\n\r\nThe `SnowflakeIO` allows to use three authentication methods against Snowflake:\r\n* username and password\r\n* key-pair\r\n* pre-obtained OAuth token\r\n\r\nThis PR is first of series, once merged, subsequent PRs will come - with Write, integration tests etc. We're also working on cross-language to support Python SDK.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to the new mailbox operator architecture in Flink 1.10, processing remaining\r\ntimers during operator shutdown can't be achieved by releasing the checkpoint\r\nlock anymore. Timers are only drained after the close() method completes.\r\nHowever, at this point new timers also cannot be set anymore.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't play well with some of Beam's code (e.g. SDF) which assumes that\r\ntimers can set new timers which are guaranteed to fire at the end of the\r\npipeline. With the current processing model of Flink 1.10 this cannot be\r\nguaranteed. This has manifesting in the Nexmark and ValidatesRunner tests.\r\n\r\nWhile I have considered other possibilities, this was the only way to restore\r\nthe timer behavior we support with Beam and have been implementing with the\r\nprevious versions of the Flink Runner.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

been confused about what protos are where, since we often used simple \"pb\" as the short id, leaving the file to hold the context. Having a slightly more descriptive short name will help understanding of the Beam portability layer.\r\nAs such\r\n* pipeline_v1 package will now use the short id pipepb.\r\n* fnexecution_v1 package will now use the short id fnpb.\r\n* jobmanagment_v1 package will now use the short id jobpb.\r\n\r\nThis also has the benefit of simplifying tooling which is less language aware.\r\n\r\nThese commits were done over the web interface, so it's possible I missed a few files. This should set the example for newer uses of the proto packages in the SDK,\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added a screendiff integration test infrastructure: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tk2P0Cu9hMjbtDWfIuQEFj07q20iqasqLPVtYVpxw3w/edit?usp=sharing\r\n2. Added the first test notebook: init_square_cube.ipynb with golden\r\n   screenshot 7a35f487b2a5f3a9b9852a8659eeb4bd.png and its test: init_square_cube_test.py.\r\n3. To add a new test, simply follow the above example. To generate a new\r\n   golden, run tests with `nosetests apache_beam/runners/interactive/testing/integration/tests/xxx_test.py --with-save-baseline`.\r\n4. Added new dependency group [interactive_test].\r\n5. The test is not part of the Jenkins pre-commit process yet. To run it\r\n   locally, make sure both [interactive] and [interactive_test]\r\n   dependencies are installed, and you have chrome installed.\r\n6. To enable such integration tests on Jenkins, chrome driver plugin\r\n   should be installed.\r\n7. The BaseTestCase provided in the screen_diff module supports running\r\n   tests for all notebooks under a directory, a single test for a golden\r\n   or a single test for a notebook.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is part of [BEAM-8889](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/BEAM-8889) to get new GCS connector 2.1.2 after #10769. This doesn't add any feature except the new API `setGrpcEnabled` that does no-op currently, but enables #10786 to get merged. Once this and #10786 are merged, developers (mostly us) can try the unstable gRPC/GCS feature by changing the gcsio dependency to 2.2.x of their Beam project.\r\n\r\nAfter gcsio releases 2.2.x, the the first version supporting gRPC/GCS protocol, that version will be added to Beam SDK so that users can try the feature by using `use_grpc_for_gcs` experiment flag (#11183).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
