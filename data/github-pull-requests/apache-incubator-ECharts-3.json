The only option is to click on an axis, but it would be helpful to clear the axis range selection by dispatching an action.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nNow, dispatchAction( { type: 'axisAreaClear'} ) will clear the axis selection range on all axes.\r\nAdditionally, dispatchAction( { type: 'axisAreaClear',  axes: ['x', 'y'] } ) will clear the axis selection range on the axes named 'x' and 'y' (the name as defined in the option.parallelAxis[i].name property).\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\nNo problems have been found with dispatchAction( { type: 'axisAreaClear'} ) so far, but a bug was found when testing { type: 'axisAreaClear', axes: ['x', 'y'] }. \r\nFor example, in the image below, if I only want to clear the selection range on the first axis by dispatchAction(), the selection range on the second axis is still there but the transparency is gone.\r\n![demo](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/128704455/cd05e7ed-8c32-4dca-a849-deb5a32eaf21)\r\nWould appreciate it if anyone can

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nIn some cases, especially when the canvas size is limited, we wish to confine the axis labels to be within an area rather than may be outside of the canvas when the label text is long. In this PR, I proposed a way to set align/verticalAlign for the first and last labels so that we can make sure they are within the boundary of the grid area.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n#19215\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThe first and last label may be too long to be displayed when the text is long and the canvas size is limited.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1184\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/779050/498aaa54-3bd5-46d7-841d-2ca561a1e1dc\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nWhen setting `alignMinLabel: 'left', alignMaxLabel: 'right'` we can make sure the text is within the grid's width and the inner labels may hide when overlap.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1171\"

`dataIndex` and then uses brush selector to understand if the point should be selected.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"479\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-11 at 8 38 18 PM\"

several PRs trying to fix them have been merged (#18240, #18962, #19174). This PR refactored and simplified the related code, fixes the problem of #19127 and tested all reported cases and make sure the label rotation algorithm is as robust as possible.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #19127\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nLabel align is not syncing with rotation flipping, so the text is at the wrong position.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/779050/89f0151e-2d68-4af1-8739-3ed33614f7f6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nUse `needsFlip` to make sure this logic is the same with align and rotation.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/779050/1477c443-daca-4021-ae48-eabc71b5bf97)\r\n\r\nDiff:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/779050/98b775b8-8535-4ace-bf26-04433845485f)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nI've run the visual test with the last version 5.4.3 and the result is as expected.

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEnables hiding of `labelLine` on emphasis when `emphasis.labelLine.show` is `false`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #19160 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nIn pie and line charts, when `emphasis.labelLine.show` was set to `false`, the labelLine didn't disappear on emphasis. This was because the `emphasis` state didn't exist for labelLine. A similar issue (#16539) was fixed, but the labelLine could be hidden only if `emphasis.labelLine.show` was set to `true` and then reset to `false`. If this option was initially set to `false`, it didn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nNow, the emphasis state is ensured for labelLine, which means that labelLine can now be hidden on emphasis if `emphasis.labelLine.show` is set to `false`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nAdd an extra space to the clip-path `width`.

During the visual test, I found that some cases may also be clipped incorrectly before, and will be corrected in this PR, for example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1252\" alt=\"image\"

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a new feature that modifies the calculation of the slice radius in the Rose Chart. It addresses the issue mentioned in #15674 by using the square root of the value to accurately represent the data in the visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #15674: Use actual area measure instead of radius in Rose Chart\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n|  Before| After|\r\n|  ----  | ----  |\r\n|  ![60851d1decfa9cf8b14fd08ab00b45b](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/134506247/c1e4f215-558f-43dd-ae57-cc0eae80093c) | ![dc49f5a2228ca171c8b061db51c7f03](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/134506247/09d7918d-801b-4f77-82a2-1486c0793241)  |\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThe problem was that the radius of the sectors in the Rose Chart was mapped to the data, which resulted in misleading visualizations. Longer slices received more emphasis due to their larger area size, exaggerating the differences in values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nAfter the fixing, the slice radius is calculated using the square root of the value. This adjustment ensures that the areas of the slices accurately reflect the data, providing a more consistent and visually accurate representation. The differences in values are now accurately represented without exaggeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to

This value window problem is due to `stack`. So in this case, the number beyond this inappropriate value window will be filtered.\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE.

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `triggerOnNull` option to the axisPointer that enables the triggering of the axisPointer on `null` values when using the `echarts.connect` or `dispatchAction` API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, when connecting multiple charts using `echarts.connect` with trigger set to `axis`, the axisPointer would not get triggered if the value in the connected chart was `null`. \r\n\r\nAn example of this can be seen in the image below (https://codesandbox.io/s/echarts-without-toggleonnull-fy4g4d?file=/src/index.js): \r\n<img width=\"646\" alt=\"SCR-20230617-lhpv\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/77129877/1027f180-285b-4514-8fbe-14b50f3e6d9d\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the user can set the option to trigger the axisPointer on `null` values using the `triggerOnNull` option, like below:\r\n```js\r\naxisPointer: {\r\n    triggerOnNull: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enables them to trigger the axisPointer on the connected charts even if those do not have a value, or their value is `null` or `undefined`.\r\n\r\n_Note_: axisPointer's `snap` property takes precedence over this feature and should be set to `false` in the `xAxis` for this to work.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1372\" alt=\"SCR-20230617-lovx\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/77129877/9e2168d1-d7e7-4f1f-a896-a06983395e5c\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Adds `sampling` support in `dataZoom`\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #18754 \r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nthe sampling method in `dataZoomSlider` is not the same as in series. In rare cases (lots of fast changing points), it may result in incorrect shape.\r\n\r\n![图片](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/1650579/956c6fca-1931-4d39-8007-91ad52112011)\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\ncalled the same processing function in `dataZoomSlider` as in `dataSample()`, and will fallback to the old implementation if sampling is not applicable.\r\n\r\n![图片](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/1650579/5773c02a-fea5-4c7d-b2a5-fa6ce2864b6f)\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [x] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#350\r\n\r\nThis PR will add an additional optional configuration `sampling` in `dataZoom` so an update is required.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\n- test case: `dataZoom-sampling.html`\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [x] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [x] others\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n1. Currently, the dependencies that are required only by the VRT tool will also be installed even if we don't run the VRT tool. As these packages are defined in the root `package.json`, they will be installed when running `npm install`. Especially, the `cwebp-bin` may need to be fetched from the GitHub Release server, which is not friendly for the Chinese and is very likely to fail. If we move it to the dedicated test folder, it can speed up npm install and avoid some potential problems for beginners.\r\n\r\n2. The dependabot upgraded `husky` to the latest version 8.x in 73e566cce94326e87173c2bf5699bc90864334e9 and the git hooks didn't work anymore due to the breaking change. So I fixed it in this PR.\r\n\r\n3. Add tips for installing dependencies first before running the VRT tool.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/26999792/5f6b610a-6236-4cb9-b4b1-b237549fd823\"

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [x] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nExport out CallbackDataParams from src/util/types as part of public API for use by consumers.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nNone for this specific type, but I can create one (there are other types I'd love to be exported as well if a single issue with all the requests is preferred)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nWe have a ECharts react wrapper component in this project https://github.com/perses/perses where we are re-defining this type, see [interface defined here](https://github.com/perses/perses/blob/v0.29.1/ui/components/src/EChart/EChart.tsx#L21-L34).\r\n\r\necharts-for-react has a [similar issue](https://github.com/hustcc/echarts-for-react/blob/e33247b9b8f55e53e8fa3a02bf92643877366559/src/types.ts#L65), but they opted to not define the callback types explicitly, which will not work for our project since we have stricter eslint settings.\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n![echarts_import_callback_error](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/9369625/dce964a4-069b-431f-8cac-a55bafdea51c)\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nType is exported as part of public API.\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nExporting some of the other types we've redefined would also be really helpful 🙏 , what is the general rule for what can be exported as part of the public API?\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-10T13:51:35Z","updated_at":"2023-06-04T00:52:11Z","closed_at":"2023-06-04T00:52:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27f019adf2b1ef2eb1d10a88522550daacb25b59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2184415760,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTg0NDE1NzYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"333333","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2801262551,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODAxMjYyNTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20first-time%20contributor","name":"PR:

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [X] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `triggerEmphasis` option to the `axisPointer` that enables the user to disable the emphasis/highlight behavior associated with the axis pointer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #18495\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the axis pointer would always trigger highlight behavior. When you have a line chart with multiple series, the axis trigger tends to highlight all the series, which is often unhelpful and can be really confusing to users.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/396962/232632417-e75836e1-2743-4b7d-95c6-94663b22c17e.png)\r\n\r\nThere is not a good way to work around this currently. You can see an example of some issues related to this in https://github.com/perses/perses/pull/1112.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the user has the option to disable this behavior on a given axis by setting `axisPointer.triggerEmphasis` to `false`. When set to `false`, the highlight/emphasis behavior will not trigger with the axis pointer. Other highlight/emphasis (e.g. on mouseover a specific line) is retained.\r\n\r\nThe default value for `axisPointer.triggerEmphasis` is `true` when not set, retaining the prior behavior.\r\n\r\nBelow is a screenshot of the `axisPointer.triggerEmphasis: false` visual test. You can see the diff is whether or not all the lines are highlighted. Note that it still retains highlight behavior on mousing over a particular line.\r\n<img width=\"1079\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/396962/232633047-581179b1-93a1-48fe-94eb-557ef0b45a37.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [X] The document changes have been made in https://github.com/apache/echarts-doc/pull/343\r\n\r\n~I'm happy to take a stab at making a PR to the docs once we're sure about the naming of the new option. I may need some help with the zh-based language bits. Let me know if you'd prefer I help with this or leave it to the maintainers.~ One of my teammates helped me with the translation, but it could use a second set of eyes to make sure we got it right.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nI added two test cases to `test/tooltip-axisPointer2.html`. One for the `false` case and one for the `true` case. Let me know if you think I should break this out into a separate test case, and if so, what you think the best name is for it.\r\n\r\nI added visual tests for each test case that take screenshots at the following points:\r\n- When mousing over a section of the chart without a line. This validates the axis pointer's configuration is behaving as expected.\r\n- When mousing over an individual line. This validates non-axis-pointer highlight behavior is not impacted.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [x] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nI was unsure of the best name for this configuration option. This behavior is referred to as `emphasis` in the configuration of the styling, but is referred to as `highlight` when triggering the event. I started with `triggerEmphasis` because I thought users might be more familiar with the styling configuration, but I can see arguments for `triggerHighlight`. I used the `trigger*` naming to match the similar-ish `triggerTooltip` option. I'm happy to rename it to whatever the maintainers think is best.

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nfix `focus: 'self'` not work when item emphasis by other component\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nFix #18475\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\nWhen `axisPointer` is set to `axis` or `line`, the elements in the chart will be triggered to be highlighted and the `__highByOuter` property on the elements will be marked to indicate that they are currently highlighted, \r\n\r\n<img width=\"615\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56526981/231806535-369f2d14-78b6-4f78-b639-64bb7fa08060.png\">\r\n\r\nbut when `emphasis.focus = 'self'` is also set, it will enter blurSeries logic, where all the elements in the chart will be forced to `blur` \r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56526981/231806930-9219cac6-a658-44c2-a26f-45e47c12c3e3.png\">\r\n\r\nand then go to `enterEmphasisWhenMouseOver`, where the element with `focus:'self'` will be highlighted\r\n \r\n<img width=\"727\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56526981/231808517-e67b1d80-a331-46bd-a163-f8ae23aa6bba.png\">\r\n\r\nBut since the element has already been highlighted by `axisPointer`, `__highByOuter` is no longer the value of `falsy`, and in this method it determines whether this property is `falsy`, and if so, it goes to the highlighting of the node.\r\n\r\nObviously, in this case, the node that should have been highlighted is first blurred, and then the highlighting logic is skipped\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\nI'm not quite sure why I'm adding the node `__highByOuter` to be `falsy` here as a basis for continuing to highlight or not\r\n\r\nSo in the `blurSeries` method, if a series is focus self and is a highlighted trigger series, if there are elements in the series that have been marked `__highByOuter` by another z component, then that element will be skipped `blur`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"690\" alt=\"image\"
