This adds correct handling of `DATE`, `DATETIME` and `TIMESTAMP` to the Snowflake spec along with tests.\r\n\r\nWhile the UI seems to imply that `DATETIME` and `TIMESTAMP` are truncated to millisecond precision, it is my understanding that they are in fact stored at nanosecond precision, hence `timespec=microsecond` like other engines with micro-/nanosecond precision.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI +

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently URL parameters are correctly handled in explore mode. However, current functionality is limited/broken in the following ways:\r\n- Any default values for `url_params` specified in charts are erased if the chart is opened via the Charts page.\r\n- query parameters passed to dashboards are not forwarded to chart requests, making them unusable in dashboards.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Default values for query parameters are left unchanged when opening a chart via the Charts page.\r\n- URL parameters passed to a dashboard are updated to the chart defaults prior to rendering.\r\n- Add note about setting default values for `url_params`.\r\n- Add cypress test to ensure params are passed through from the dashboard to chart requests.\r\n- Add python test to ensure that url params are appended to pre-defined params.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nDatasource query:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/69005658-f661bc00-092d-11ea-9fa6-a56df7c65bf3.png)\r\n\r\nChart metadata with default

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI'm working on a project to migrate charts using the Druid native JSON-based query API to Druid SQL and wanted to determine which of the slice parameters aka form-data fields needed to be modified. \r\n\r\nGiven that the JSON form-data currently doesn't have schema validation nor is typed (not in the future I sense it should be) I simply ran a query to fetch all the fields which exist in our deployment and felt these should be documented as an interim form of record keeping. \r\n\r\nGranted Markdown isn't probably the best document form to tabularize these fields (a spreadsheet is probably preferred) but I felt having this information reside in the repo is probably preferred. \r\n\r\nPer the comments in the doc some of these fields may be deprecated and others are not categorized but I sense it's a least a start. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

only if it is, the span related to the fav-star is rendered.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhilst spelunking through our production data in preparation to migrate slices from the Druid native JSON-based API to SQLAlchemy I discovered that a non-trivial amount of slices (~ 10%) still contained the legacy filter fields in the form-data; `filters`, `having`, `having_filters`, and `where` in addition to `adhoc_filters` (which takes precedence). Though these fields are not problematic it adds cruft to the form-data and makes analyses unnecessarily more complex.    \r\n\r\nThese fields should have been removed in [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/9fc37ea9f1ff032dea923012613d4e7189ada178/superset/migrations/versions/bddc498dd179_adhoc_filters.py) migration (the `convert_legacy_filters_into_adhoc` method deletes the old fields) and after trying several flows I wasn't able to determine how these fields were persisting (note loading/saving a slice with legacy filters will replace them with ad-hoc). \r\n\r\nThis PR performs the following: \r\n\r\n1. Re-applies the previous migration logic. The hypothesis is that maybe when the previous migration was run the code was in a state where these fields persisted. \r\n2. Updates the example data to remove the obsolete fields and updates the filters to be ad-hoc.  \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nRan the DB upgrade on a dump of our production data and verified that the legacy filters were no longer present in the form-data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAfter filter scope selector UI, we will get filters scope data like this format:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    filterKey: '108___time_range',\r\n    checkedChartIds: [101, 102, 103, 104],\r\n}\r\n```\r\ndashboard has layout data in tree structure, a simplified example could be like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    'ROOT_ID': { children: ['tab-A', 'tab-B'] }\r\n    'tab-A': { children: [101, 102, 103]},\r\n    'tab-B': { children: [104, 105]},\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthis PR will create an algorithm that creates _**filter scope**_ object for each filter field, and will be merged into dashboard redux state (as part of dashboardFilter state):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    18: {\r\n        columns: {\r\n            _time_range: ['last year'],\r\n        },\r\n        labels: {\r\n            _time_range: \"Time Range\",\r\n        },\r\n        scopes: {\r\n            _time_range: {\r\n               scope: ['tab-A', 'tab-B'],\r\n               immune: [105],\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Basic rules to decide scope:**\r\n\r\n- A `scope` object has 2 fields:\r\n   - The minimum component unit for scope is `tab`.  A filter can apply to one or multiple tabs.\r\n   - If a chart inside a tab but not applicable to a filter, it will be added to immune list.\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n    scope: [list of tab ids],\r\n    immune: [list of chart ids],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- If any chart is applicable to a filter field, the chart's container tab should be in the filter's scope. Other charts inside the tab that are not applicable to the filter, will be added to immune list.\r\n- If all sub tabs are applicable to a filter field, we mark the parent tab in the filter' scope. Any chart that under the parent tab and not applicable to the filter, will be added to immune list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nnew unit test is added.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the time range endpoints are incorrect from a dashboard as `slc` is `None` when getting the form data and thus if undefined the time range endpoints were `(inclusive, exclusive)` rather than relying on the default or database override. \r\n\r\nThe logic here is to determine whether the form-data represents an existing slice (or a mutation of an existing slice) hence falling back to the `slice_id` if the `slc` is defined.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTested locally to ensure the the `time_range_endpoints` was correctly defined.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

of the Druid SQLAlchemy engine. After a recent PR ( #8482 ) re-enabled the function of the `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE` flag, I figured I'd follow through and enshrine the deprecation in code by defaulting `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE` to `False`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n###

features were broken with the new UI-based BigQuery connection method. This PR standardizes one instance of `create_engine` being called directly instead of through the Database model's `get_sqla_engine` function, adds consideration of a missing parameter to the connection check endpoint, and updates the CSV Upload system for BigQuery to look at the connection info provided to the SQLAlchemy Engine.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the default colors for both categorical and sequential schemes are hardcoded in `controls.js`, which means that changing the default values in `setupColors.js` don't have any effect on the default color scheme. This PR changes `controls.js` to use the default scheme as defined in `setupColors.js`, and also sets the default key for `sequentialSchemeRegistry` (previously only hard coded in `controls.js`).\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested locally by changing the default key in `setupColors.js`, and verifying that the default colors in a test dashboard reflected the change. If needed I can look into adding tests for this.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460 @mistercrunch @graceguo-supercat

notification appears when 90% of 5MB local storage is used but in our deployment some users are seeing this warning regularly despite the browser being fully responsive so we'd like to be able to tweak the threshold.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe notification looks like

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a mechanism to specify a SIP-15 grace period after which all charts will adhere to the `[start, end)` time range interval. This is configurable and provides a mechanism for each installation to handle the transition as they see fit. In the future (circa 6+ months) the interim SIP-15 logic should be removed which will enforce all deployments to use the `[start, end)` time range interval. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nAdded new tests and verified the RST formatting. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE` configuration option was removed from the codebase at some point. Druid's preferred connection method is via the SQL interface, so this change is necessary in order to deprecate the Druid API-based connection methods in Superset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

Boot Superset with the configuration option `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE` set to `True`, ensure Druid options appear in the \"Sources\" menu.\r\n- [ ] Boot Superset with the configuration option `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE` set to `False`, ensure Druid options are absent from the \"Sources\" menu.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [X] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8463 - I decided to split this change out of that PR for clarity and

as a tuple especially for comparison reasons.\r\n\r\nThis PR also ensures that the endpoints if present in the JSON form-data are decoded using the enum (as opposed to string) for consistency.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the [SIP-15](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/6360) issue where for string column types the start endpoint may behave like `(start` rather than `[start` due to lexicographical ordering if the RHS is not encoded to mimic the formatting of the LHS. \r\n\r\nFor example at Airbnb we have over 20,000 tables in Superset which have a `ds` column (datestamp) which adheres to the `YYYY-MM-DD` ISO 8601 format however no python-date-format is specified for these columns and thus the filter endpoints behave like, \r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT\r\n    '2018-01-01' >= '2018-01-01 00:00:00',\r\n    '2018-01-01' <= '2018-01-02 00:00:00'\r\nFALSE TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e., `(start` rather than `[start`. This problem could be remedied by setting the python-date-format for every table but that seems overkill and doesn't ensure newly added tables will define the formatting. This PR creates a default column/python-date-format mapping on a per engine basis where one can specify a fallback (default) format if not specified. \r\n\r\nNote https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8464 switched the order of evaluation for obtaining the `datetime` SQL literal ensuring known per engine data types conversions, i.e., `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, etc. are applied prior to any python-date-format. This helps to ensure that the mapping isn't heavy handed, i.e., applying the format in an unnecessary or problematic manner. \r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img

But it caused other charts that used the datasource became invalid.\r\n \r\n1. Don't open the Datasource Editor modal on clicking the data source name. Several people have accidentally edited the datasource when they really mean to change (swap) datasources. Now will show change datasources modal: ¬†\r\n<img width=\"463\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-29 at 3 10 57 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67813255-56b3bb00-fa5e-11e9-9ae8-0aef6390ad32.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Change the order of options in the drop-down menu so that \"Change datasource\" is the first option (instead of Edit Datasource). Similar reasoning to the above; we want to prioritize Change Datasource over Edit Datasource.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n![image-2019-10-15-11-40-17-893](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67609985-9a4bb380-f744-11e9-9b10-09d97c4b0c30.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n<img width=\"439\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-25 at 4 18 11 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67609958-6a041500-f744-11e9-97eb-82d85f5ac9cc.png\">\r\n\r\n3. Land the user on the Metrics tab when they get to the Edit Datasource modal (instead of Settings). Adding Metrics is likely the most common reason people would want to edit the datasource from the Explore view. It makes it easier for people to do the most frequent action, and moves people away from the Settings which is the most risky and the least frequent use case.\r\n\r\n4. Add a warning to the Settings tab (that is always there) that communicates that changes to this could break all charts, not just your own, so be careful. e.g. \"Be careful. Changes to these settings can break all charts, including charts owned by other people.\"\r\n<img width=\"903\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-29 at 3 09 22 PM\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8172 introduced the ability to estimate query costs before running them. Currently, this is supported by Presto, and it returns a _relative_ CPU and network cost.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we want to show the cost as dollars, time or percentile, instead of showing relative costs. Since the relationship between the relative cost and the actual cost varies from infrastructure to infrastructure, we need to provide users a way of customizing the query cost estimate.\r\n\r\nHere's a hypothetical example where we use a coefficient to compute the query cost in dollars based on CPU and network cost:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef presto_query_cost_formatter(result):\r\n    cpu_coefficient = 1e-12\r\n    network_coefficient = 1e-12\r\n\r\n    cost = 0\r\n    for row in result:\r\n        cost += row.get(\"cpuCost\", 0) * cpu_coefficient\r\n        cost += row.get(\"networkCost\", 0) * network_coefficient\r\n\r\n    return [{\"Cost\": f\"US$ {cost:.2f}\"}]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFAULT_FEATURE_FLAGS = {\r\n    \"ESTIMATE_QUERY_COST\": True,\r\n    \"QUERY_COST_FORMATTER\": {\"presto\": presto_query_cost_formatter},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1680\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR updates a number of aspects related to the datetime SQL literal logic which is used for the RHS of the time filter comparisons. Specifically: \r\n\r\n1. Make `DbEngineSpec.convert_dttm` optionally return `None` if a type conversion does not exist.\r\n2. Updates the logic in `dttm_sql_literal` to first try to convert a `datetime` object to a SQL expression (1) prior to converting either a string on numerical type based on the python-date-format. The reason for this change is we should handle known types before falling back to using the  python-date-format, as in theory these could be defined incorrectly for non-string/float types. \r\n3. Updates the `convert_dttm` logic for a number of database engines. There were a handful of examples where this was simply returning either i) a string representation of the `datetime` object rather than the necessary SQL expression for casting from a `datetime` object to the native temporal type, or ii) incorrect `datetime` formatting or casting logic.  Note I'm not familiar with a number of these database engines and thus the updated conversions were the result of Googling. This logic should probably be validated. \r\n4. Adds unit tests for the  database engine specific `convert_dttm` function. \r\n5. Uses f-strings rather than `str.format(...)`. \r\n5. Replaced `dttm.isoformat()[:10]` with `dttm.date().isoformat()` in improve readability. \r\n\r\nRegarding timestamp precision some databases only seem to support seconds whereas others support microseconds. Where possible the `datetime` object is formatted to the highest level precision available.\r\n\r\nNote for context I sense this PoC is probably the end state for correctly handling the necessary casting of types (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7682).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSomewhere along the line, type definitions were added to the `superset/connectors/druid/models.py` file that would cause NameErrors when the `pydruid` package was not installed. This PR wraps the appropriate function definitions in `try/except` statements to allow the system to boot without `pydruid` installed. Additionally, somewhere along the line the `DRUID_IS_ACTIVE` option was disabled, though it remains defaulted to `True` in `config.py`. I have re-enabled the configuration so that users may disable the (I believe depricated?) menu items.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nA new tutorial that focusing more on how an end user might use Superset, rather than how an administrator might set it up and get it working for the first time. I have added this as a new rst file, and changed the hierarchy within the documents so that there's now a tutorials page, with links to the existing tutorial and the new one.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial starts with basic instructions on how to load CSV data into superset and create a visualization. It then progresses through some different visualizations (pivot, bar chart, line chart), dashboard elements (filters, markdown and publishing). Then, it covers some more advanced features: advanced analytics and annotations.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the new hierarchy of tutorials:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45243854/68161667-59ae2000-ff24-11e9-955a-aa9965f01fbe.png)\r\n\r\nFull text of the tutorial is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T6Zy9slc1vHHIGp8jepnMjplf2nMHxLTY-SyORh9hUE/edit?usp=sharing) (you should be able to comment).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nThis tutorial is based on a real dataset from [here](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/b2bc9c3f-c892-4bcf-b8c1-0d0efdace3fa/dft-flight-data) which is a set of flights taken by an organization in 2011. This data is licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0, an ASF category A license. Then it was combined with data from [here](https://ourairports.com/data/), licensed under the public domain. Then I tidied it up by removing a single line (a flight with the same origin and destination). It's currently [on my github](https://github.com/francishemingway/unofficial-superset-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial_flights.csv).\r\n\r\n### Questions I have:\r\nIt would be great to get some guidance on the following:\r\n- Is there somewhere within the project's repositories to host the data file.\r\n- Should I open a new issue? This addresses more fully  #698.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-27T20:36:49Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:41:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T23:45:07Z","merged_at":"2019-11-08T23:45:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ed2190ebda60646763bd679aa63f9d9d87695fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently all engines except Hive try to create table metadata when uploading CSVs. However, the CSV upload feature throws an exception when uploading using either `replace` or `append` when table metadata is present, despite the upload having taken place. This PR changes the following:\r\n- If table metadata is present and the CSV upload is successful, the old metadata is updated to reflect the new table contents.\r\n- Table metadata is now created for Hive like other engines when uploading CSVs.\r\n- The extension `tsv` added to `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` and implemented in `forms.py`, as I feel it is nowadays a commonly accepted extension for tab separated csv files.\r\n- Fixes to i18n CSV messages that were previously hardcoded, i.e. didn't work.\r\n- New integration tests added to test all common cases.\r\n- Refactor: parts of the CSV uploading logic had to be moved from `db_engine_specs` to `database/views` as they would otherwise have caused circular imports.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + Tested all possible combinations locally.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: closes #8451\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@pengyejun @willbarrett @mistercrunch @john-bodley @betodealmeida

But it caused other charts that used the datasource became invalid.\r\n \r\n1. Don't open the Datasource Editor modal on clicking the data source name. Several people have accidentally edited the datasource when they really mean to change (swap) datasources. Now will show change datasources modal: ¬†\r\n![image-2019-10-15-11-38-57-049](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67609912-24dfe300-f744-11e9-9d3e-47b99f1c9f22.png)\r\n\r\n2. Change the order of options in the drop-down menu so that \"Change datasource\" is the first option (instead of Edit Datasource). Similar reasoning to the above; we want to prioritize Change Datasource over Edit Datasource.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n![image-2019-10-15-11-40-17-893](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67609985-9a4bb380-f744-11e9-9b10-09d97c4b0c30.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n<img width=\"439\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-25 at 4 18 11 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67609958-6a041500-f744-11e9-97eb-82d85f5ac9cc.png\">\r\n\r\n3. Land the user on the Metrics tab when they get to the Edit Datasource modal (instead of Settings). Adding Metrics is likely the most common reason people would want to edit the datasource from the Explore view. It makes it easier for people to do the most frequent action, and moves people away from the Settings which is the most risky and the least frequent use case.\r\n\r\n4. Make the table name for a datasource only editable by **_admin role_** or _**creator**_ of the datasource\r\n![Screen_Shot_2019-10-28_at_12_13_51_PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/67710128-9a35f880-f97c-11e9-97b7-04371cb2c76a.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Add a warning to the Settings tab (that is always there) that communicates that changes to this could break all charts, not just your own, so be careful. e.g. \"Be careful. Changes to these settings can break all charts, including charts owned by other people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8409/files#diff-6a3371457528722a734f3c51d9238c13R482 we no longer want to use the `config.get` format, but instead assume that all configuration options are set. This PR alters all existing usages of `config.get` to the `config[]` syntax. Note that this will cause errors if those configuration options are not provided. In order to get the system running again, I had to set the following configuration options locally:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Stuff that needs defaulting\r\nENABLE_CHUNK_ENCODING = False\r\nFEATURE_FLAGS = {}\r\nEVENT_LOGGER = None\r\nSQLALCHEMY_CUSTOM_PASSWORD_STORE = None\r\nQUERY_LOGGER = None\r\nFAB_ADD_SECURITY_VIEWS = True\r\nSUPERSET_LOG_VIEW = True\r\nHTTP_HEADERS = {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm somewhat concerned about the effect of merging this in terms of stability, so I'm looking for feedback from the community, especially @villebro who clued me in to the preferred approach in the first place.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- Run CI \r\n-

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhilst playing with the time range picker I discovered that for relative times (\"Last Week\" etc.) the reference time (either shown in default or via a tooltip) would use the client timezone rather than the server timezone. This was problematic say at 2019-10-24:18:00:00 PDT the UI would reference `2019-10-24 00:00:00` in various tooltips however when the query was executed it would use `2019-10-25 00:00:00`.  \r\n\r\nInitially I was unsure whether we should parse the server timezone to the client but it seems in [other places](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/bd9a2c15e79f2f337bf3bdfd67603eee8d0e16a9/superset/assets/src/modules/dates.js#L27) there's the assumption that times are expressed in UTC (irrespective of the server timezone). \r\n\r\nNote the time range picker does not explicitly set the timezone by default for absolute dates, i.e., the query will actually run in reference to the timezone of the executing database engine. However one can specify the timezone via the ISO 8601 format. I‚Äôm not certain whether Superset should be more opinionated with regards to timezones. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nI added a tooltip to explicitly define where/how times are evaluated. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"197\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-26 at 6 17 08 PM\"

different databases. It was difficult to find what was targeting which bit of implementation. This PR breaks up that test file into one test file per platform, as well as a base test module to inherit from for shared functionality. This should make it easier to increase test coverage of db_engine_specs going forward.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nRun tests.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nProblem statement: currently connections to BigQuery databases cannot be configured without adding code to Superset or adding configuration to its execution environment in the form of Google Cloud account credentials.\r\n\r\nSolution proposed: Add an encrypted field on the `dbs` table to hold extended connection information. This field can hold JSON configuration including secrets and add that information on to the database connection object during instantiation. This allows us to configure a service account in Google Cloud and connect to a BigQuery dataset without any code or configuration changes in Superset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Create a dataset in BigQuery in Google Cloud\r\n* Create a service account in Google Cloud with access to the dataset\r\n* Download the service account's identity file in JSON format\r\n* Open the `Add Database` screen in Superset \r\n* Fill in the SqlAlchemy URL with `bigquery://project-name` where `project-name` is the name of the Google Cloud project that your BigQuery dataset is associated with.\r\n* Add JSON to the `Secure Extra` field with the following structure:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"credentials_info\": <content from the identity file from Google Cloud>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n* Click \"Test Connection\" - It should say the connection is OK.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

believe that `s` needed to be a `str` yet it was being passed a type of `Optional[str]`.  The logic I added in `QueryObject` turned out to be wrong as in fact `s` was of type `Optional[str]` per: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/9fc37ea9f1ff032dea923012613d4e7189ada178/superset/utils/core.py#L303\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nAdded additional unit test.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL
