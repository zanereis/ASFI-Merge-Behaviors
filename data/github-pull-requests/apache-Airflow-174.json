slightly improved some small UI elements that were a bit off. \r\nChanges:\r\n- Removed `btn-sm` class that made the buttons next to each DAG on DAGs list not centered perfectly.\r\n- Changed everywhere the spelling of DAGs (made the last letter lowercase in 'DAGS' word)\r\n- Changed the 'Conn Type' and 'Conn Id' to 'Connection Type' Connection Id' (not sure why this whas abbreviated everywhere, but if I am not aware of something, let me know and I can revert this change)\r\n- Fixed strange use of punctuation marks inside a view when trying to mark DAG run as failed\r\n- Changed font size inside DAG run circle from 8 to 9. It makes it a lot more readable and it can still fit even 4-digit numbers. I think we can even go with 10, but then 4-digit numbers slightly overlay the circle (who have 4-digit runs though?).\r\n\r\nHere I highlighted with red color the old font size and misaligned icons inside button. The green highlights the elements after changes.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7412964/135896512-7b44b5d0-9cda-42d5-a8ea-3151c0dde2a1.png)\r\n\r\nIf there are any other places

notes\r\n\r\nDid not update all tests cus i just want to put it out there for thoughts first.\r\n\r\nI think that ultimately we need to pull some of this logic up into base secrets backend.\r\n\r\nE.g. perhaps in base secrets backend we can accept parameter `connection_as_kwargs` to let it know whether to expect kwargs or URI.  and i say kwargs instead of json because some things like vault and aws secrets manager are already key value stores that may return dict not json string.\r\n\r\nAnd i think some more logic is commonly duplicated e.g. building out the paths given a secret id. \r\n\r\nAnd if we want to standardize how airflow conns should be json serialized, we may need to add an abstraction `get_secret` which just gets the raw value --- so that the parsing can be fully handled by the base class.  \r\n\r\nAlso: Why parameterize with `connection_as_kwargs` instead of subclass?  It doesn't make sense to have a *Json version of every secrets backend, especially because the json part of it only applies to connections and not config or variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-03T17:25:39Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T16:32:39Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T16:32:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30576bf6d36b006016a85cd459106236eafc5232","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

is a simple change to rename variables to be consistent with code logic and with the \"story-line\"\r\n\r\nSo, basically code calls `create_dagrun()` to create a dag run... and assigns it to a variable called \"trigger\". Although it's \"ok\" to name that way, it's much more readable to make it clear/explicit and call returned object a \"dagrun\" as it's an instance of it.\r\nAlso reading it in English trigger conveys a bit different meaning i.e. original purpose of the action `airflow dags trigger ...` and so not best name for the returned object and subsequent collection of objects i.e. triggers[]\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for

tree diagram cannot properly represent a graph. This has led to a number of issues:\r\n- users being confused seeing multiple leaves representing the same task\r\n- displaying task groups has never really worked well #18009, #13242\r\n- task groups have never had a collapse/expand functionality like graph view #16112\r\n- The long tree names and branches easily leads to a overlapping elements #17717\r\n- It is all built in a hard-to-follow d3 setup that makes maintaining the view hard\r\n- A recursively built tree is more computationally heavy than a flat list #17148\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\n- Remove the \"tree\" part of tree view. Show runs and tasks but leave dependency lines to the graph view\r\n- Allow a user to better abstract away parts of their DAGs with Task Groups and simplify their workflows\r\n- Build in a modern technology that we can more easily maintain\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1192\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-01 at 5 16 29 PM\"

performance changes #8931\r\n- Task groups have summaries and can expand/collapse just like the graph view\r\n- Task groups default to collapsed for an easier quick view but user changes are saved via localstorage\r\n- Grid lines and hover effects to see which task you are inspecting\r\n- Built in React to more easily maintain and can bring over to an eventual new Airflow UI in AIP-38\r\n- Ready to add new features in the roadmap like Dag Versioning or Task Mapping\r\n- Include a play icon to better indicate manual dag runs (dark borders weren't very intuitive)\r\n- Testing of React components\r\n\r\nSubsequent PRs:\r\n\r\n- Rename Tree view (Grid?) and update all documentation\r\n- Filter over the state legend to highlight tasks and dag runs like graph view\r\n- Update default colors and better support color-blind friendly modes\r\n- More elegantly handle outliers in the Dag Run Duration chart (if it normally takes 5 minutes but then a run takes 5 hours the graph won't look great)\r\n- Update the Task Instance and Dag Run Action Modals too\r\n- More dynamic scrolling around the 100s of dag runs instead of the clunky \"Update\" button\r\n- Improve render times with Lazy Loading #13066\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)**

This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed).

is to clean up test database once tests are completed as some test create users and roles and don't delete them. This affects other test suites when run in different scenarios like `pytest tests` to test all. For example one test adds a user 'test' and doesn't delete it. Then some other test author creates a 'test' user as well.

is an ongoing effort to enhance example DAGs by setting static values for `start_date` (already complete for core example DAGs), cleaning up and/or implementing useful `default_args`, and removing/limiting the use of redundant, default connection ID values.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly addresses these 3 cleanup areas in example DAGs across Apache providers.  There are other small docs updates and use of the `TriggerRule` attr rather than the literal string where applicable.\r\n\r\n> Note: In the `example_beam` DAG, there was an opportunity to consolidate task args to `default_args` for a couple of DAGs, however, this was not implemented as the changes would have conflicted too much with the operator documentation that references the example DAG.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

work was inspired by responses to this [linkedin comment](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6848963597859618816?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6848963597859618816%2C6848966678429138944%29). The aim is to add simple banner hovering at top of the Airflow webui and indicating what environment type it is (test, staging, production etc).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-09-30 at 21 13 05\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9528307/135516488-cd9a2249-c8ea-4e3a-93e7-1f93ec955659.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe banner is by default disabled. Personally I think we should provided users with predefined environment types with correlated colours (to keep the UI visually consistent). However, I'm extremely poor front developer so if someone would like to help with polishing the css and html I would be grateful ❤️ \r\n\r\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/13FrpeVH09Zrb2/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47rtbejrchvsara8ohngjlm54av315fg6z5z8tyzoa&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)","created_at":"2021-09-30T19:17:13Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T00:11:46Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T00:11:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6daec0b7fdcfc4dfc06978486f7e775904e3642","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

the Cassandra sensors, `CassandraRecordSensor` and `CassandraTableSensor`, do not have a default value for the `cassandra_conn_id` parameter even though one is set within the `CassandraHook`.  Because of this, users are required to explicitly pass in an arg for the `cassandra_conn_id` when using the sensors in pipelines.  The missing default value for the connection ID does not follow the typical pattern for developing operators/sensors.  \r\n\r\nThis PR adds this default value for the sensor modules.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^

#18592 \r\n\r\nMoves the `convert_env_vars` portion of the `__init__(...)` into the `execute(...)` fn.  This allows for `env_vars` to be templated before we try to perform any checks or operations on them.  Also added (`pytest`) tests for this new function which confirms old behavior still works and tests the new behavior when `render_template_as_native_obj` is set to `True` at the DAG level.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`SparkKubernetesSensor` is that, if the spark is running with sidecar containers for instance `istio-proxy` or `vault-sidecar`, which is rather common is some cases, the previous version cannot retrieve logs correctly and will run into errors.\r\n\r\nA quick fix would be to add an option that allows developers to configure which container is the driver and can retrieve logs from driver
