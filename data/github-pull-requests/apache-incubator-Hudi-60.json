*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently when doing Hudi queries w/ Spark, it won't load the external configurations. Say if customers enabled metadata listing in their global config file, then this would let them actually query w/o metadata feature enabled. This PR fixes this issue and allows loading global configs during the Hudi reading phase.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added a test case in [TestSqlConf.scala] to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n##

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreate marker file for every log file. It will improvement perf of rollback of log file when marker file based rollback is enabled. It will also help cleaning partial generated log file which can be deleted.  [HUDI-3026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3026) depends on this change.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1517\r\n\r\n1. Add a callback to HoodieLogFormatWriter so that we can inject mark file creation when log file is created.\r\n\r\n- remove previous logic which generate marker use simulating data file name\r\n- generate marker for each log file\r\n- distinguish markers against log file for new log file from existing log file.\r\n\r\n2. Change reconcile logic in HoodieTable so that partial created log file can be deleted.\r\n\r\n3. for log file created, we can treat them as data file which is different with appending log file.\r\n\r\n4. Add rollback logic in markerFileRollbackStrategy so that we can use markfile to rollback log blocks.\r\n\r\n5. Adjust upgrade and downgrade UT to adapt this change\r\n\r\nCallback logic: it is minor and few thing we can test. So no specific UT for it.\r\nreconcile logic of log file : Add a UT for this.\r\nrollback logic: covered by existing UT.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRollback and clean\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-25T17:55:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T01:46:15Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T01:21:33Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T01:21:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"df64d647fa32b33aa9bcf8b147ab72993cf7ccb1","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nWhen we start multiple hudi jobs in a sparkSession, or cache some rdds before a hudi job starts, SparkRDDWriteClient#releaseResources will release all persistent rdds, causing spark to recalculate.\r\nSo I think we should add the switch of whether to release all rdds.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the log file reader for S3 with hadoop-aws 2.7.x.\r\n\r\n`HoodieLogFileReader` uses `FSDataInputStream:seek` API to scan a log file and load block content.  In S3, `S3AInputStream::seek` implementation is used.  For  hadoop-aws 2.7.x, `S3AInputStream` throws `EOFException` when the seek position is the file size, as shown in the [source code](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/branch-2.7.4/hadoop-tools/hadoop-aws/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/s3a/S3AInputStream.java#L80) below:\r\n```\r\n    if (contentLength > 0 && pos > contentLength-1) {\r\n      throw new EOFException(\r\n          FSExceptionMessages.CANNOT_SEEK_PAST_EOF\r\n          + \" \" + pos);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis causes the `EOFException` for scanning the last block in a file, since the seek position is the file size.  The problem can be reproduced by running hudi-cli `metadata list-partitions` on a Hudi MOR table on S3, with log files in metadata table.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to avoid seeking at the file size and handle the corrupt block checking differently.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Changes the logic of `isBlockCorrupted()` in `HoodieLogFileReader` to adapt to different seek behavior\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThe PR is verified through the following test scenarios.  Two MOR tables are generated, with metadata table enabled and log files in metadata table, one on S3, another on local.  The metadata table files partitions:\r\n```\r\n   121 Jan 28 23:03 .files-0000_00000000000000.log.1_0-0-0\r\n  5746 Jan 28 23:04 .files-0000_00000000000000.log.1_0-21-249\r\n  7697 Jan 28 23:04 .files-0000_00000000000000.log.2_0-34-260\r\n  7696 Jan 28 23:13 .files-0000_00000000000000.log.3_0-16-175\r\n    93 Jan 28 23:04 .hoodie_partition_metadata\r\n```\r\nEnvironments:\r\n  - Docker demo environment: spark 2.4.4, hadoop-aws 2.7.4, aws-java-sdk 1.7.4, openjdk version \"1.8.0_212\"\r\n```\r\ncd $SPARK_HOME\r\ncd jars/\r\ncurl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/amazonaws/aws-java-sdk/1.7.4/aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.jar --output aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.jar\r\nchmod 644 aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.jar\r\ncurl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-aws/2.7.4/hadoop-aws-2.7.4.jar -o hadoop-aws-2.7.4.jar \r\nchmod 644 hadoop-aws-2.7.4.jar\r\nexport CLIENT_JAR=/opt/spark/jars/hadoop-aws-2.7.4.jar:/opt/spark/jars/aws-java-sdk-1.7.4.jar\r\ncd /var/hoodie/ws/\r\n./hudi-cli/hudi-cli.sh \r\n```\r\n- Local environment: spark 3.2.0, hadoop-aws 3.3.1,aws-java-sdk-bundle 1.12.48, openjdk version \"1.8.0_292\"\r\n\r\nTest scenarios:\r\n- Run hudi-cli `metadata list-partitions` on MOR table on S3.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Most of our existing tests deletes input data at the end of every iteration so that we can do long running tests. So validation at the end of every iteration happens only for partial data from input. Here we are adding medium scale tests where in we don't delete any input data at all and runs for 20 iterations.\r\n- Added test properties specifically to test out repeated clustering for a long running deltastreamer test job. \r\n- Minor fixes to long running jobs to reduce to 1 validation per iteration. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the functionality to validate the column stats and bloom filters stored in metadata table against the ground truth in base files in `HoodieMetadataTableValidator`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds two new validation tasks in `HoodieMetadataTableValidator`\r\n - `--validate-all-column-stats`: validate column stats for all columns in the schema\r\n - `--validate-bloom-filters`: validate bloom filters of base files\r\n- Adds a new class `BloomFilterData` to facilitate validation of bloom filters\r\n- Makes `ParquetUtils::readMetadata` static\r\n- Cleans up naming and adds minor changes around logging messages and levels\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR is verified by running the `HoodieMetadataTableValidator` with spark-submit for all validation task to make sure that existing and new validation logic work properly.  The validation of column stats is able to catch a bug, which is addressed in #4875 .\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRefactoring HoodieTestDataGenerator to provide for reproducible Builds: currently, `HoodieTestDataGenerator` relies on static state which make its state shared across all of the tests making data generation dependent on the order of execution.\r\n\r\nInstead we should properly abstract `HoodieTestDataGenerator` to hold all of the state w/in individual instances so that individual Tests can:\r\n\r\n1. Create they own isolated instance (which won't be affected by other Tests)\r\n2. Pass \"seed\" value to DataGenerator to init its PRNG w/ it, so that it always produces the same (pseudo-)random sequence (for a given seed)\r\n3. Be certain that all of the data produced by DataGenerator will be 100% reproducible w/ the same seed (meaning that all of the DataGenerator operations w/in it only rely on such internal PRNG and don't rely on any external sources, such as `UUID.randomUUID()`, `System.currentTimeMillis()`, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- \"_hoodie_is_deleted\" is more a reserved field in hoodie.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Found couple of issues while testing restore w/ metadata enabled (COW and MOR table). \r\n- avro schema for metadata payload did not have default set to null for colsStats and bloomFilterMetadata that got added recently. Was running into issues with avro deserialization. \r\n- While reading logs for metadata table, partition name was not set with MergedLogRecordScanner. Have created a follow [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3454) to chase all such code paths and fix. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Tested restore for COW and MOR table for few scenarios. restore succeeded and validated the table after restore to ensure table record count matched the restored commit. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRework of #4761 \r\nThis diff introduces follinwg changes:\r\n\r\n- Write stats are converted to metadata index records during the commit. Making them use the HoodieData type so that the record generation scales up with needs. \r\n- Metadata index init support for bloom filter and column stats partitions.\r\n- When building the BloomFilter from the index records, using the type param stored in the payload instead of hardcoded type.\r\n- Delta writes can change column ranges and the column stats index need to be properly updated with new ranges to be consistent with the table dataset. This fix add column stats index update support for the delta writes.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRedo of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4446\r\n\r\nWe may find some data which should be rollbacked in hudi table.\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\n\r\nLet's first recall how rollback plan generated about log blocks for deltaCommit. Hudi takes two cases into consideration.\r\n\r\nFor some log file with no base file, they are comprised by records which are all 'insert record'. Delete them directly. Here we assume all inserted record should be covered by this way.\r\nFor those fileID which are updated according to inflight commit meta of instant we want to rollback, we append command block to these log file to rollback.  Here all updated record are handled.\r\nHowever, the first condition is not always true. For indexes which can index log file, they could insert record to some existing log file. In current process, inflight hoodieCommitMeta was generated before they are assigned to specific filegroup. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. make upsert partitioner generate an execution workload stats which including all fileGroup will be written into comparing with workload generated by input data. This will cover the case that insert data is written into some log files which is recognized as small file when using Hbase Index.\r\n2.  In such case, we cannot guarantee that all log files which contains only insert data could be deleted in rollback. They may be rollback using command block. So handle this case in compactor.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - Added integration tests for end-to-end: spark client\r\n  \r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA

`DropPartitions` etc, but as we enable profile, `spark3.1.x`, it will change property `spark3.version` to `spark3.1.2`. Module `hudi-spark3` should not changed its spark version if we enable profile `spark3.1.x`(as hudi-spark3 is the module that contains the code that compatible with spark 3.2.0(and above) versions).\r\n\r\nSo I introduce two properties: `spark3-common.version`, `spark3.1.x.version` to avoid this conflict.\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn the continuous mode with async table services turned on such as compaction and clustering, Deltastreamer does not properly shut down the async table services and the delta sync service upon failure from the commit action not in the table service.  This causes the Spark application to hang without doing any work, and the Spark app does not exit in this case.  The root cause is due to a cyclic shutdown logic causing the delta sync service and the async table service to wait for each other to terminate.  This PR fixes the shutdown logic so that after any failure, from the commit action or async table services, the Deltastreamer can shut down all services properly and the Spark app can exit.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, through Remote JVM Debug and YourKit Java profiling, the sequence of events below during shutdown is followed, causing endless waiting, and the executor of `DeltaSyncService` is not properly shut down:\r\n```\r\nBaseHoodieWriteClient\r\n-> public HoodieCleanMetadata clean(String cleanInstantTime, boolean scheduleInline, boolean skipLocking) throws HoodieIOException\r\n -> throw new IllegalMonitorStateException(\"Simulate lock exception\");\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer (HoodieDeltaStreamer$DeltaSyncService)\r\n-> protected Pair<CompletableFuture, ExecutorService> startService() \r\n -> LOG.error(\"Shutting down delta-sync due to exception\", e);\r\n -> shutdownAsyncServices(error);\r\n\r\nHoodieAsyncService (SparkAsyncCompactService)\r\n-> public void shutdown(boolean force)\r\n -> executor.shutdown();\r\n -> executor.awaitTermination(24, TimeUnit.HOURS);\r\n\r\nAsyncCompactService (SparkAsyncCompactService)\r\n-> protected Pair<CompletableFuture, ExecutorService> startService()\r\n -> return true;\r\n\r\nHoodieAsyncService (HoodieDeltaStreamer$DeltaSyncService)\r\n-> public void shutdown(boolean force)\r\n -> executor.shutdown();\r\n -> executor.awaitTermination(24, TimeUnit.HOURS);\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix shutdown callback of async table services and shutdown logic in HoodieDeltaStreamer and introduce other triggers for exiting in HoodieAsyncService.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThree failure cases are tested locally and Deltastreamer exits in all of them:\r\n- Case 1: Deltastreamer continuous mode writing MOR table, async cleaner enabled, clean fails\r\n- Case 2: Deltastreamer continuous mode writing COW table, async clustering enabled, clustering execution fails\r\n- Case 3: Deltastreamer continuous mode writing MOR table, async cleaner enabled, delta commit fails\r\n(See how the failures are triggered through code at the end)\r\n\r\nSequence of events in Case 1 after the fix:\r\n```\r\nBaseHoodieWriteClient\r\n-> public HoodieCleanMetadata clean(String cleanInstantTime, boolean scheduleInline, boolean skipLocking) throws HoodieIOException\r\n -> throw new IllegalMonitorStateException(\"Simulate lock exception\");\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer (HoodieDeltaStreamer$DeltaSyncService)\r\n-> protected Pair<CompletableFuture, ExecutorService> startService() \r\n -> LOG.error(\"Shutting down delta-sync due to exception\", e);\r\n -> shutdownAsyncServices(error);\r\n -> executor.shutdownNow();\r\n\r\nHoodieAsyncService (HoodieDeltaStreamer$DeltaSyncService)\r\n-> public void waitForShutdown() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException \r\n -> LOG.error(\"Service shutdown with error\", ex);\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer\r\n-> public void sync() throws Exception \r\n -> throw new HoodieException(e.getMessage(), e);\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer\r\n-> public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception\r\n -> jssc.stop();\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer\r\n-> public void close()\r\n -> deltaSync.close();\r\n```\r\nSequence of events in Case 2 after the fix:\r\n```\r\nSparkExecuteClusteringCommitActionExecutor\r\n-> public HoodieWriteMetadata<JavaRDD<WriteStatus>> execute()\r\n -> throw new HoodieException(\"Simulate clustering error\");\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer (HoodieDeltaStreamer$DeltaSyncService)\r\n-> protected Boolean onInitializingWriteClient(SparkRDDWriteClient writeClient) {\r\n -> in callback: asyncClusteringService.get().start((error) -> true);\r\n\r\nHoodieDeltaStreamer (HoodieDeltaStreamer$DeltaSyncService)\r\n-> protected Pair<CompletableFuture, ExecutorService> startService() \r\n -> throw new HoodieException(\"Async clustering failed.

pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAfter this change, when the compaction metadata commits successfully but the data set commit state switch fails, the metadata table may bookkeep the compaction files which has been rolledback(removed), but the odds are far less than the case that metadata and data set commits never happens.\r\n\r\nAnd the compaction files are actually idempotent.\r\n\r\nHave no good solution to fix this completely, maybe we should check the archive timeline for accurate check whether the instant to rollback is archived.\r\n\r\nFinally i add a new filtering condition for metadata table archiving to address this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTimeline server when serving remote requests, has a logic to refresh its local view of the timeline based on timeline hash. Client sends a timeline hash and timeline server compares with its local timeline hash and if they differ, a refresh of timeline happens before serving the request. But this refresh gets triggered even if the client is behind, but the server is already caught up. This could have severe perf impact with async table services and spark streaming pipeline use-cases where commit throughput is high. So, adding a new value to be maintained by the timeline for lastUpdatedTime. and the same will be sent as param with remote request as well. \r\n\r\nFix: So, the fix ensures that timeline server triggers a refresh of local timeline only if its last known instant < client's last known instant. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Timeline server triggers a refresh of its local timeline only if its last known instant < client's last known instant in addition to  timeline hash mismatch. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nRelying on existing tests. Will ask some users in the community to test out the patch. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nIf there is a inflight clustering instant at the earliest of active time line, AbstractTableFileSystemView#getxxBaseFIle() will be broken because of un-committed data file created by this clustering job.\r\n```\r\nSteps to re produce this problem (set archive min =2, max =3 and disable clean)\r\n1. do ingestion with commit 1\r\n2. trigger a clustering job with replacecommit 2\r\n3. do another ingestion until commit 1 is archived ---> for now commit2 is the earliest instant at active timeline. Also we could delete commit 1 directly \r\n4. compare the count(*) query result with/without replacecommit 2\r\n```\r\nWe could find the result without replacecommit 2 is bigger than with it.\r\n\r\nThis patch is try to fix it and **We couldn't take uncommitted data file created by inflight clustering as a `HoodieBaseFile`**\r\n\r\nWe could look at added UT for more details and without this Patch, this added UT will failed because of additional un-committed clustering data file.\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nTimeline server when serving remote requests, has a logic to refresh its local view of the timeline based on timeline hash. Client sends a timeline hash and timeline server compares with its local timeline hash and if they differ, a refresh of timeline happens before serving the request. But this refresh gets triggered even if the client is behind, but the server is already caught up. This could have severe perf impact with async table services and spark streaming pipeline use-cases where commit throughput is high. So, adding a new value to be maintained by the timeline for lastUpdatedTime. and the same will be sent as param with remote request as well. \r\n\r\nFix: So, the fix ensures that timeline server triggers a refresh of local timeline only if its lastUpdatedTime < client's lastUpdatedTime. \r\n\r\nTo discuss: \r\nClocks could differ in timeline server compared to that of the executor (client) and there could be drift as well. So, not very sure if we can rely on the exact comparison of last updated time between client and server. \r\n\r\nAnother option: I am wondering if we can rely on lastKnownInstant(HoodieInstant) from client and compare it w/ that of timeline in timeline server and decide whether to refresh or not instead of the lastUpdatedTime. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added lastUpdatedTime to HoodieTimeline which gets refreshed whenever the timeline is updated. The same value is sent via remote requests to Timeline server. \r\n- Timeline server triggers a refresh of its local timeline only if its lastUpdatedTime < client's lastUpdatedTime in addition to  timeline hash mismatch. \r\n\r\nThanks to [guanziyue](https://github.com/guanziyue) who helped us with the fix. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Couple of users in the community actually tested this and contributed the patch. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n -
