users installing Airflow for the first time may be unaware that Airflow currently supports only recent versions of Python 3. Also, successful installation requires Python 3. The mention of `pip` has been a clue to those who know it comes with Python 3, but others have been in the dark. Users unaware of what version of Python is in their path might be prompted to check -- and they may even be surprised to learn that their recent installation of Python defaulted to Python

encountered some data loss today due to a user deleting a DAG from the UI called `project.load`, which then deleted all of the history from other DAGs called `project.load.bigquery` and `project.load.trino`, which also caused them to run unexpectedly due to the resetting of run history.\r\n\r\nNote - we don't use SubDAGs, we're just using `.` in the DAG ID as a separator for a hierarchical naming system.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, deleting a DAG `my_dag` will delete all of the metadata for any DAG which starts with `my_dag.`, as it is assumed that the latter are subdags of the former:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            cond = or_(model.dag_id == dag_id, model.dag_id.like(dag_id + \".%\"))\r\n            count += session.query(model).filter(cond).delete(synchronize_session='fetch')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis isn't always the case. \r\n\r\nAnyways, this PR changes the delete_dag function so that it only deletes the intended DAG and DAGs starting with `<dag_id>.` _which are also SubDAGs_. I think that there may still be some other edge cases where DAGs can be unintentionally deleted, but this patches the most apparent case. \r\n\r\nThis can all be cleaned up even more once the deprecation of SubDAGs is complete (Airflow 3?)\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-07T21:46:50Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T21:06:52Z","closed_at":"2022-01-10T19:55:51Z","merged_at":"2022-01-10T19:55:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"5980d2b05eee484256c634d5efae9410265c65e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's

build we explain in green that this is invalid warning\r\n\r\n* the \"scripted\" steps of docker build have nicely blue headers\r\n  that visually separate steps of building the iamge and give\r\n

PR improves `test_run_storing_query_ids_extra` test for Snowflake Hook.\r\n\r\n- Redundant testing of `Snowflake.get_conn` (This is already tested in `test_get_conn_should_call_connect`)\r\n- The expected values were derived from input, so you can't easily fail the test ! I have passed expected results and input separately\r\n- We were passing duplicate values in `query_ids`. I have fixed that by changing the code to only access `cur.sfqid` once in a variable and reuse that variable for logging and returning.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: bharanidharan14 <94612827+bharanidharan14@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

produces a warning when root user is used to run pip install.\r\nThis is done for a good reason - because installing PIP this way\r\nclashes with a number of distro-managed python packages.\r\n\r\nThe warning cannot be disabled even if our use case is legitimate\r\nas has been extensively discussed in\r\npypa/pip#10556.\r\n\r\nThe advice given by the warning is a bit misleading - it suggests\r\nto use virtualenv, but since this is considered a bad practice\r\nfor container building and because we need to create virtualenvs\r\ndynamically inside the image, using virtualenv is a bad solution\r\nfor us. It's been attempted in #19189 and failed.\r\n\r\nInstead we create an airflow user and use PIP_USER=\"true\" which\r\ninstalls all dependencies in build segment to ~/.local folder\r\nfrom where we can copy it to the main image.\r\n\r\nThat get rids of the warning and at the same time allows us to\r\nkeep the best practices of building the images.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

previous implementation is a bit too convoluted for me to make sense, so I broke down the logic and rewrote the entire function to make sure all possibilities are covered. The current logic, as documented in the docstring, is:\r\n\r\n1. If the input `exec_date_or_run_id` matches a DAG run ID, return the run.\r\n2. Try to parse the input as a date. If that works, and the resulting date matches a DAG run’s logical date, return the run.\r\n3. If `create_if_necessary` is False and the input works for neither of the above, raise `DagRunNotFound`.\r\n4. Try to create a new DAG run.

This is partially available because Airflow as a system allows for event logging, but these event logs have a ton of noise. Each organization may only care about certain events only - maybe some want only POST events, some could want all events minus system generated events, others could want to see them all. The fact is, this is all available but to present this data could be useful if we have it just on the dag view level. In this case, we filter the view to just display events for the specific dag of course, and we provide in the airflow.cfg a way to only filter based on events they care for. The screenshots below capture this, and how can interact with this.\r\nIn this view too, there is a link back to the Log View which will have all events. We simply put the events of the last X days (default it to 31 in the cfg) but we can change this behavior if the open source community doesn't like it. It is primarily meant to allow users to know who cleared the dag, or marked a date or anything of that sort recently. Actions that would directly affect the run of the workflow.\r\n\r\nFirst screenshots are just of all the records, but later on we use the below settigns to remove the excluded events to show they will not be displayed either.\r\n```\r\n# Number of dags to look back for dag audit log view\r\naudit_trail_query_days = 31\r\n\r\n# Types of events to ignore for dag audit log view\r\n# E.g. excluded_events = dagrun_success,landing_times\r\naudit_view_excluded_events = tree,running\r\n\r\n# Types of events to include for dag audit log view\r\n# e.g. included_events = dagrun_cleared,failed\r\naudit_view_included_events =\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1779\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 1 18 10 AM\"

#18392\r\n\r\nalternative to #19546\r\n\r\nCurrently triggers may be queued up as soon as they leave the \"running\" set `triggers`.  This results in duplicate triggers when a trigger has been removed from this set but not yet deleted from the database.  We resolve by checking against not just running triggers but all triggers known to the triggerer instance.\r\n\r\nPreviously (#19546) I approached this in a different way.  But as I worked out how to reproduce the behavior in a test, I obtained a better understanding of the conditions, and realized that there was a simpler way.  \r\n\r\nUnioning all those sets is maybe a bit ugly, but it's better than a query, I think.\r\n\r\nThe first commit adds a failing test that reproduces the race condition, without the fix.  The second commit fixes the condition and removes the xfail decorator.\r\n\r\ncc @andrewgodwin

\"buildkit\" is much more modern docker build mechanism and supports\r\nmultiarchitecture builds which makes it suitable for our future ARM\r\nsupport, it also has nicer UI and much more sophisticated

(not needed now, we can\r\n    always build image with --cache-from and buildkit will pull cached\r\n    layers as needed\r\n  * building the image when performing pre-commit (rather than that\r\n    we simply encourage users to rebuild the image via breeze command)\r\n  * pulling the images before building\r\n  * separate 'build' cache kept in our registry (not needed any more\r\n    as buildkit allows to keep cache for all segments of multi-segmented\r\n    build in a single cache\r\n  * the nice animated tty UI of buildkit eliminates the need of manual\r\n    spinner\r\n  * and a number of other complexities.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look only at the last commit as it is based on #20238 #20679\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

was updated in Airflow 2.2.0 via https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16634 which restricts a user to even views the DagRuns and TI records if they don't have \"edit\" permissions on DAG even though it has \"read\" permissions.\r\n\r\nThe Behaviour seems inconsistent as a User can still view those from the Graph and Tree View of the DAG.\r\n\r\nAnd since we have got `@action_has_dag_edit_access` on all the Actions like Delete/Clear etc the approach in this PR is better as when a user will try to perform any actions from the List Dag Run view like deleting the record it will give a Access Denied error.\r\n\r\ncc @Jorricks\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/148161333-18190033-8d39-45a3-a01f-4a3ddf4b8d78.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

queue's purpose is to track triggers that need to be canceled. I found the language `to_delete` a bit confusing because for one it does not actually delete them but cancel them.  The deletion work is actually in `cleanup_finished_triggers` (and there it's deleting only from the `triggers` dict and not the database.  Deletion from the database happens elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this method will _usually_ not do anything.  The normal flow is that the trigger process will exit normally and be purged from the `triggers` dict by the cleanup process.  This method is more for exceptional circumstances where we need to cancel (in other words terminate) triggers that are _currently running_ but for whatever reason _no longer should be_.  E.g. when a task is killed and therefore the trigger is no longer needed, or some multi-triggerer scenarios.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally the use of the word deletion here has an ambiguity which would be good to avoid. Namely, we are talking about deletion from the triggers dict, and not deletion from the database.\r\n\r\n@kaxil @potiuk  i think these objects should be renamed but just not sure if this is considered \"breaking\" since maybe you could say the triggerer process is \"internal\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-04T19:17:42Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T20:01:53Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T20:12:27Z","merged_at":"2022-01-05T20:12:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"c20ad79b40ea2b213f6dca221221c6dbd55bd08f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

main use case of GKEStartPodOperator is running Kubernetes Pod from outside of cluster using Google Service Account. GKEStartPodOperator runs `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` to construct config file for Kubernetes. We have to set `in_cluster` parameter `False` explicitly to use that config file. So the default value of `in_cluster` param of GKEStartPodOperator should be `False`.\r\n\r\nI also added warning for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

script for generating issue for \"Provider status\" and release\r\nprocess did not work well when only subset of providers were released.\r\nThe issue was generated including some already released

PR fixes it by adding a flag that only considers packages that\r\nare present in dist folder (which matches the process of release\r\nmanager)\r\n\r\nThe process has also been updated with more accurate description of\r\nthe steps to take - including manual execution of the script rather\r\nthan using Breeze (Breeze is not neede for this script).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
