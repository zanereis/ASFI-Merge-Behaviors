What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe first job called from saveAsHadoopDataset, running in each executor, does not calculate the writtenBytes of OutputMetrics correctly (writtenBytes is 0). The reason is that we did not initialize the callback function called to find bytes written in the right way. As usual, statisticsTable which records statistics in a FileSystem must be initialized at the beginning (this will be triggered when open SparkHadoopWriter). One solution for this issue is to switch the initialization order of HadoopOutputMetrics and SparkHadoopWriter.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI observed this while running a oozie job trying to connect to hbase via spark.\r\nIt look like the creds are not being passed in thehttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.2/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/security/HadoopFSCredentialProvider.scala#L53 for 2.2 release.\r\nMore Info as to why it fails on secure grid:\r\nOozie client gets the necessary tokens the application needs before launching. It passes those tokens along to the oozie launcher job (MR job) which will then actually call the Spark client to launch the spark app and pass the tokens along.\r\nThe oozie launcher job cannot get anymore tokens because all it has is tokens ( you can't get tokens with tokens, you need tgt or keytab). \r\nThe error here is because the launcher job runs the Spark Client to submit the spark job but the spark client doesn't see that it already has the hdfs tokens so it tries to get more, which ends with the exception.\r\nThere was a change with SPARK-19021 to generalize the hdfs credentials provider that changed it so we don't pass the existing credentials into the call to get tokens so it doesn't realize it already has the necessary tokens.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21890\r\nModified to pass creds to get delegation tokens\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing on our secure cluster","created_at":"2017-09-01T14:10:53Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T21:06:32Z","closed_at":"2017-09-07T21:06:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97fe422c43f179c27dfd6ab6718802a94f856ceb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7043d98ccb7f5cfc4e854f609afa3c380d274c36","head":{"label":"redsanket:SPARK-21890","ref":"SPARK-21890","sha":"7043d98ccb7f5cfc4e854f609afa3c380d274c36","user":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39640326,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTY0MDMyNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"redsanket/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"redsanket","id":8295799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTU3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8295799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket","html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/redsanket/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/redsanket/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nwhen use SparkFiles.get a file on driver in yarn-client or yarn-cluster, it will report file not found exception.\r\nThis exception only happens on driver, SparkFiles.get on executor works fine.\r\nwe can reproduce the bug as follows:\r\n```scala\r\nval conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"SparkFilesTest\")\r\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\ndef testOnDriver(fileName: String) = {\r\n    val file = new File(SparkFiles.get(fileName))\r\n    if (!file.exists()) {\r\n        println(s\"$file not exist\")\r\n    } else {\r\n        // print file content on driver\r\n        val content = Source.fromFile(file).getLines().mkString(\"\\n\")\r\n        println(s\"File content: ${content}\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// the output will be file not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconf = SparkConf().setAppName(\"test files\")\r\nsc = SparkContext(appName=\"spark files test\")\r\ndef test_on_driver(filename):\r\n    file = SparkFiles.get(filename)\r\n    print(\"file path: {}\".format(file))\r\n    if os.path.exists(file):\r\n        with open(file) as f:\r\n        lines = f.readlines()\r\n        print(lines)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"file doesn't exist\")\r\n        run_command(\"ls .\")\r\n```\r\nthe output will be file not exist\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\ntested in integration tests and manual tests\r\nsubmit the demo case in yarn-cluster and yarn-client mode, and verify the test result\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master yarn-cluster --files README.md --class

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor the given example below, the predicate added by `InferFiltersFromConstraints` is folded by `ConstantPropagation` later, this leads to unconverged optimize iteration:\r\n```\r\nSeq((1, 1)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t1\")\r\nSeq(1, 2).toDF(\"col\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t2\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.col1 = 1 AND 1 = t1.col2 AND t1.col1 = t2.col AND t1.col2 = t2.col\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can fix this by adjusting the indent of the optimize rules.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe track the producer, by maintaining an `inuse` thread count of the producer. If the producer is `inuse` and we get eviction orders from guava, we move such producers to a queue(`closeQueue`) and periodically (in a non-thread way) check for its `inuse` status and eventually close it. This way a producer will not be closed while being used and also not get assigned to a new task when evicted.\r\n\r\nWe had to do this because, guava has a limitation that it does not allow for custom eviction strategy. https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3013\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated existing and added appropriate test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix StackOverflowError in `branch-2.2`. This happens when `OptimizeMetadataOnlyQuery` returns `LocalRelation` with partition informations without materializations, e.g. for Data source tables (Parquet/ORC) or Hive table stored by Parquet with convertMetastore.\r\n`master` branch has the same logic, but it doesn't throw StackOverflowError due to the other differences.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 2.2.0   // 2.2.1-SNAPSHOT is the same.\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE t_1000 (a INT, p INT) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p)\")\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> (1 to 1000).foreach(p => sql(s\"ALTER TABLE t_1000 ADD PARTITION (p=$p)\"))\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p) FROM t_1000\").collect\r\njava.lang.StackOverflowError\r\n  at java.io.ObjectOutputStream.defaultWriteFields(ObjectOutputStream.java:1522)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAll the windows command scripts can not handle quotes in parameter.\r\n\r\nRun a windows command shell with parameter which has quotes can reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\meng\\software\\spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7> bin\\spark-shell --driver-java-options \" -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 \"\r\n'C:\\Users\\meng\\software\\spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7\\bin\\spark-shell2.cmd\" --driver-java-options \"' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\r\noperable program or batch file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows recognize \"--driver-java-options\" as part of the command.\r\nAll the Windows command script has the following code have the bug.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd /V /E /C \"<other command>\" %*\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should quote command and parameters like \r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd /V /E /C \"\"<other command>\" %*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest manually on Windows 10 and Windows 7\r\n\r\nWe can verify it by the following demo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\meng\\program\\demo>cat a.cmd\r\n@echo off\r\ncmd /V /E /C \"b.cmd\" %*\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\meng\\program\\demo>cat b.cmd\r\n@echo off\r\necho %*\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\meng\\program\\demo>cat c.cmd\r\n@echo off\r\ncmd /V /E /C \"\"b.cmd\"

file.\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\meng\\program\\demo>c.cmd \"123\"\r\n\"123\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the spark-shell.cmd example, change it to the following code will make the command execute succeed.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd /V /E /C \"\"%~dp0spark-shell2.cmd\" %*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\meng\\software\\spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7> bin\\spark-shell  --driver-java-options \" -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 \"\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel). For SparkR, use setLogLevel(newLevel).\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-31T00:51:33Z","updated_at":"2017-10-07T01:29:41Z","closed_at":"2017-10-06T14:41:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5b5fa814fb6d1de7a79370b1dc59adca31c24a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4795b0db95a260e96077fe56f182ade631100d09","head":{"label":"minixalpha:master","ref":"master","sha":"4795b0db95a260e96077fe56f182ade631100d09","user":{"login":"minixalpha","id":3703094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDMwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3703094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha","html_url":"https://github.com/minixalpha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":101940663,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDE5NDA2NjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"minixalpha/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minixalpha","id":3703094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDMwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3703094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha","html_url":"https://github.com/minixalpha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minixalpha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minixalpha/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added code to check actual bytecode size when compiling generated code. In #18810, we added code to give up code compilation and use interpreter execution in `SparkPlan` if the line number of generated functions goes over `maxLinesPerFunction`. But, we already have code to collect metrics for compiled bytecode size in `CodeGenerator` object. So,we could easily reuse the code for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `WholeStageCodegenSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-30T02:05:03Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T17:11:04Z","closed_at":"2017-10-04T17:11:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02087770e5f7a65da1b59f9dd2d34026d619ded3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/09ae105c101a1b31d2a8873976c01590c50411d2","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-21871","ref":"SPARK-21871","sha":"09ae105c101a1b31d2a8873976c01590c50411d2","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr proposes to split aggregation code into pieces in `HashAggregateExec`. In #18810, we got performance regression if JVMs didn't compile too long functions (the limit is 8000 in bytecode size). I checked and I found the codegen of `HashAggregateExec` frequently goes over the limit, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"id % 1024 AS a\", \"id AS b\").write.saveAsTable(\"t\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT a, KURTOSIS(b)FROM t GROUP BY a\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis query goes over the limit and the actual bytecode size is `12356`.\r\nThis pr split the aggregation code into small separate functions and, in a simple example;\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT SUM(a), AVG(a) FROM VALUES(1) t(a)\").debugCodegen\r\n```\r\n\r\n- generated  code with this pr:\r\n```\r\n/* 083 */   private void agg_doAggregateWithoutKey() throws java.io.IOException {\r\n/* 084 */     // initialize aggregation buffer\r\n/* 085 */     final long agg_value = -1L;\r\n/* 086 */     agg_bufIsNull = true;\r\n/* 087 */     agg_bufValue = agg_value;\r\n/* 088 */     boolean agg_isNull1 = false;\r\n/* 089 */     double agg_value1 = -1.0;\r\n/* 090 */     if (!false) {\r\n/* 091 */       agg_value1 = (double) 0;\r\n/* 092 */     }\r\n/* 093 */     agg_bufIsNull1 = agg_isNull1;\r\n/* 094 */     agg_bufValue1 = agg_value1;\r\n/* 095 */     agg_bufIsNull2 = false;\r\n/* 096 */     agg_bufValue2 = 0L;\r\n/* 097 */\r\n/* 098 */     while (inputadapter_input.hasNext() && !stopEarly()) {\r\n/* 099 */       InternalRow inputadapter_row = (InternalRow) inputadapter_input.next();\r\n/* 100 */       boolean inputadapter_isNull = inputadapter_row.isNullAt(0);\r\n/* 101 */       long inputadapter_value = inputadapter_isNull ?

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nkillExecutor api currently does not allow killing an executor without updating the total number of executors needed. In case of dynamic allocation is turned on and the allocator tries to kill an executor, the scheduler reduces the total number of executors needed ( see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.scala#L635) which is incorrect because the allocator already takes care

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**The current shuffle planning logic**\r\n\r\n1. Each operator specifies the distribution requirements for its children, via the `Distribution` interface.\r\n2. Each operator specifies its output partitioning, via the `Partitioning` interface.\r\n3. `Partitioning.satisfy` determines whether a `Partitioning` can satisfy a `Distribution`.\r\n4. For each operator, check each child of it, add a shuffle node above the child if the child partitioning can not satisfy the required distribution.\r\n5. For each operator, check if its children's output partitionings are compatible with each other, via the `Partitioning.compatibleWith`.\r\n6. If the check in 5 failed, add a shuffle above each child.\r\n7. try to eliminate the shuffles added in 6, via `Partitioning.guarantees`.\r\n\r\nThis design has a major problem with the definition of \"compatible\".\r\n\r\n`Partitioning.compatibleWith` is not well defined, ideally a `Partitioning` can't know if it's compatible with other `Partitioning`, without more information from the operator. For example, `t1 join t2 on t1.a = t2.b`, `HashPartitioning(a, 10)` should be compatible with `HashPartitioning(b, 10)` under this case, but the partitioning itself doesn't know it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, currently `Partitioning.compatibleWith` always return false except for literals, which make it almost useless. This also means, if an operator has distribution requirements for multiple children, Spark always add shuffle nodes to all the children(although some of them can be eliminated). However, there is no guarantee that the children's output partitionings are compatible with each other after adding these shuffles, we just assume that the operator will only specify `ClusteredDistribution` for multiple children.\r\n\r\nI think it's very hard to guarantee children co-partition for all kinds of operators, and we can not even give a clear definition about co-partition between distributions like `ClusteredDistribution(a,b)` and `ClusteredDistribution(c)`.\r\n\r\nI think we should drop the \"compatible\" concept in the distribution model, and let the operator achieve the co-partition requirement by special distribution requirements.\r\n\r\n**Proposed shuffle planning logic after this PR**\r\n(The first 4 are same as before)\r\n1. Each operator specifies the distribution requirements for its children, via the `Distribution` interface.\r\n2. Each operator specifies its output partitioning, via the `Partitioning` interface.\r\n3. `Partitioning.satisfy` determines whether a `Partitioning` can satisfy a `Distribution`.\r\n4. For each operator, check each child of it, add a shuffle node above the child if the child partitioning can not satisfy the required distribution.\r\n5. For each operator, check if its children's output partitionings have the same number of partitions.\r\n6. If the check in 5 failed, pick the max number of partitions from children's output partitionings, and add shuffle to child whose number of partitions doesn't equal to the max one.\r\n\r\nThe new distribution model is very simple, we only have one kind of relationship, which is `Partitioning.satisfy`. For multiple children, Spark only guarantees they have the same number of partitions, and it's the operator's responsibility to leverage this guarantee to achieve more complicated requirements. For example, non-broadcast joins can use the newly added `HashPartitionedDistribution` to achieve co-partition.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.","created_at":"2017-08-29T17:00:58Z","updated_at":"2018-01-08T11:44:31Z","closed_at":"2018-01-08T11:44:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef68cb23b793627e0a0584b5112b581c73b7f595","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2f1bc1a077929e9d6bdb7e855debfdbac3ca03e","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:exchange","ref":"exchange","sha":"a2f1bc1a077929e9d6bdb7e855debfdbac3ca03e","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nwhen use SparkFiles.get a file on driver in yarn-client or yarn-cluster, it will report file not found exception.\r\nThis exception only happens on driver, SparkFiles.get on executor works fine.\r\nwe can reproduce the bug as follows:\r\n```scala\r\nval conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"SparkFilesTest\")\r\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\ndef testOnDriver(fileName: String) = {\r\n    val file = new File(SparkFiles.get(fileName))\r\n    if (!file.exists()) {\r\n        println(s\"$file not exist\")\r\n    } else {\r\n        // print file content on driver\r\n        val content = Source.fromFile(file).getLines().mkString(\"\\n\")\r\n        println(s\"File content: ${content}\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// the output will be file not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconf = SparkConf().setAppName(\"test files\")\r\nsc = SparkContext(appName=\"spark files test\")\r\ndef test_on_driver(filename):\r\n    file = SparkFiles.get(filename)\r\n    print(\"file path: {}\".format(file))\r\n    if os.path.exists(file):\r\n        with open(file) as f:\r\n        lines = f.readlines()\r\n        print(lines)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(\"file doesn't exist\")\r\n        run_command(\"ls .\")\r\n```\r\nthe output will be file not exist\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntested in integration tests and manual tests\r\nsubmit the demo case in yarn-cluster and yarn-client mode, and verify the test result\r\nthe testing  commands are:\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master yarn-cluster --files README.md --class \"testing.SparkFilesTest\" testing.jar\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master yarn-client --files README.md --class \"testing.SparkFilesTest\" testing.jar\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master yarn-cluster --files README.md test_get_files.py\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master yarn-client --files README.md

profiling of a structured streaming application with Kafka as the source, I came across this exception:\r\n\r\n![Structured Streaming Kafka Exceptions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3448320/29743366-4149ef78-8a99-11e7-94d6-f0cbb691134a.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a 1 minute sample, which caused 106K `NonLocalReturnControl` exceptions to be thrown. \r\nThis happens because `CachedKafkaConsumer.get` is ran inside:\r\n\r\n`private def runUninterruptiblyIfPossible[T](body: => T): T`\r\n\r\nWhere `body: => T` is the `get` method. Turning the method into a function means that in order to escape the `while` loop defined in `get` the runtime has to do dirty tricks which involve throwing the above exception.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInstead of using `return` (which is generally not recommended in Scala), we place the result of the `fetchData` method inside a local variable and use a boolean flag to indicate the status of fetching data, which we monitor as our predicate to the `while` loop.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've ran the `KafkaSourceSuite` to make sure regression passes. Since the exception isn't visible from user code, there is no way (at least that I could think of) to add this as a test to the existing suite.","created_at":"2017-08-26T17:11:32Z","updated_at":"2017-08-30T09:36:21Z","closed_at":"2017-08-30T09:36:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2200750b2a34636d0e5525030b4f1da2082fd220","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18b9301553427a7b6c038e144f1be52949d82eb9","head":{"label":"YuvalItzchakov:master","ref":"master","sha":"18b9301553427a7b6c038e144f1be52949d82eb9","user":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3b66b1c44060fb0ebf292830b08f71e990779800","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18067\r\n\r\n## What problem is being addressed in this PR ?\r\n\r\nCurrently shuffle based joins require its children to be shuffled over all the columns in the join condition. In case the child node is already distributed over a subset of columns in the join condition, this shuffle is not needed (eg. if the input is bucketed, if the input is output of a subquery). Avoiding the shuffle makes the join run faster and more stably as its single stage.\r\n\r\nTo dive deeper, lets look at this example. Both input tables `table1` and `table2` are bucketed on columns `i` and `j` and have 8 buckets. The query is joining the 2 tables over `i,j,k`. With bucketing, all the rows with the same values of `i` and `j` should reside in the same bucket of both the inputs. So, if we simply sort the corresponding buckets over the join columns and perform the join, that would suffice the requirements.\r\n\r\n| partitions  | table1 (i,j,k) values | table2 (i,j,k) values  |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| bucket 0  | (0,0,1)  (0,0,2)  (1,0,4) | (0,0,1)  (0,0,3) |\r\n| bucket 1  | (1,0,2) (1,1,1) | (1,0,1) (1,0,2) (1,1,2) |\r\n| bucket 2  | (0,1,8) (0,1,6) | (0,1,1) |\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBoth shuffled hash join and sort merge join would not keep track of `which keys should the children be distributed on ?`. To start off, this is same as the join keys. The rule `ReorderJoinPredicates` is modified to detect if the child's output partitioning is over a subset of join keys and based on that the distribution keys for the join operator are revised.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Added unit test.\r\n- manual test:\r\n\r\nQuery:\r\n```\r\n-- both the input tables are bucketed over columns `i` and `j`\r\nSELECT * FROM table1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCorrelated predicate subqueries are rewritten into `Join` by the rule `RewritePredicateSubquery`  during optimization.\r\n\r\nIt is possibly that the two sides of the `Join` have conflicting attributes. The query plans produced by `RewritePredicateSubquery` become unresolved and break structural integrity.\r\n\r\nWe should check if there are conflicting attributes in the `Join` and de-duplicate them by adding a `Project`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2017-08-25T05:44:53Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:34:43Z","closed_at":"2017-09-06T14:45:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e76e61866733479c3d6daf12ad4f93461067cb7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19050/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19050/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19050/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/85508287ca1b98f3a3c341efd3ac70f99b56bc73","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-21835","ref":"SPARK-21835","sha":"85508287ca1b98f3a3c341efd3ac70f99b56bc73","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

Server Launch uses SparkClassCommandBuilder for launching the server. It is observed that SPARK_CLASSPATH has been removed and deprecated. For spark-submit this takes a different route and spark.driver.extraClasspath takes care of specifying additional jars in the classpath that were previously specified in the SPARK_CLASSPATH. Right now the only way specify the additional jars for launching daemons such as history server is using SPARK_DIST_CLASSPATH (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/hadoop-provided.html) but this I presume is a distribution classpath. It would be nice to have a similar config like spark.driver.extraClasspath for launching daemons similar to history server.\r\n\r\nAdded new environment variable SPARK_DAEMON_CLASSPATH to set classpath for launching daemons. Tested and verified for History Server and Standalone Mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nInitially, history server start script would fail for the reason being that it could not find the required jars for launching the server in the java classpath.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDesign document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bC2sxHoF3XbAvUHQebpylAktH6B3PSTVAGIOCYj0Mbg/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nKeep track of nodes which are going to be shutdown to prevent scheduling tasks. The PR is designed with spot instances in mind, where there is some notice (depending on the cloud vendor) that the node will be shut down.\r\n\r\nSince Kubernetes has a first class notion of pod shut down and grace periods the decommissioning support is available on Kubernetes. For other deployments it is left to the instance to notify the worker(s) of decommissioning with SIGPWR.\r\n\r\nSPARK-20628 is a sub-task of SPARK-20624 with follow up tasks to perform migration of data and re-launching of tasks. SPARK-20628 is distinct from other mechanism where Spark its self has control of executor decommissioning, however the later follow up tasks in SPARK-20624 should be usable across voluntary and involuntary termination (e.g. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19041 could provide a good mechanism for doing data copy during involuntary termination).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExtension of AppClientSuite to cover decommissioning and addition of explicit worker decom suite.\r\n\r\nAreas of future work:\r\n\r\n* Follow up with relevant companion notification scripts in the relevant spark-on-[X] for X in {cloud providers} projects.\r\n* Integrate Yarn support ( see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19267 for how to get / handle Yarn state, but depends on YARN-6483 which is merged but not back ported).","created_at":"2017-08-24T21:07:09Z","updated_at":"2019-11-08T21:18:54Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T21:18:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"77c104d65311be6a261261cf88b4ee1e3fe04b90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR bumps the ANTLR version to 4.7, and fixes a number of small parser related issues uncovered by the bump.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for upgrading is that in some cases the current version of ANTLR (4.5) can exhibit exponential slowdowns if it needs to parse boolean predicates. For example the following query will take forever to parse:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM RANGE(1000) \r\nWHERE\r\nTRUE\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\nAND NOT upper(DESCRIPTION) LIKE '%FOO%'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by a know bug in ANTLR (https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/994), which was fixed in version 4.6.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2017-08-24T16:24:01Z","updated_at":"2017-08-24T23:36:48Z","closed_at":"2017-08-24T23:36:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf907903ca35e49ead0a671db27845d5850cb6e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/700453a6a7ad75055d5fa920a495aa24d895ca7c","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-21830","ref":"SPARK-21830","sha":"700453a6a7ad75055d5fa920a495aa24d895ca7c","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd an option to to recover cached data when using dynamic allocation.  Currently when dynamic allocation decommissions an idle executor, any cached RDD blocks on that executor will be lost. Saving that data has the potential for a real performance boost for shared instances of spark.\r\n\r\nIf there are any problems saving cached data, this change falls back to regular dynamic allocation behavior and drops the blocks. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThere are unit tests in RecoverCacheShutdownSuite and integration tests in RecoverCachedDataSuite. There are also benchmark results available here:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith this new feature I propose to introduce a mechanism to allow users to specify a list of nodes in the cluster where executors/tasks should not run for a specific job.\r\nThe proposed implementation that I tested (see PR) uses the Spark blacklist mechanism. With the parameter spark.blacklist.alwaysBlacklistedNodes, a list of user-specified nodes is added to the blacklist at the start of the Spark Context and it is never expired. \r\nI have tested this on a YARN cluster on a case taken from the original production problem and I confirm a performance improvement of about 5x for the specific test case I have. I imagine that there can be other cases where Spark users may want to blacklist a set of nodes. This can be used for troubleshooting, including cases where certain nodes/executors are slow for a given workload and this is caused by external agents, so the anomaly is not picked up by the cluster manager.\r\nSee also SPARK-21829\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test has been added to the BlackListTrackerSuite.\r\nThe patch has also been successfully tested manually on a YARN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn out production environments, it often happens that even the application has finished, but the CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend process still exists and take up the resource.\r\n\r\nTake a look at ExecutorRunner.scala, it maybe failed to terminate process in killProcess method for some reason. In this case, the process of CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend will likely be orphaned. It would be great to support a script to kill the CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend process forcibly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen finding the widest common type of a sequence of data types where the beginning of the sequence consists solely of DateType/Timestamp and Numeric types and the following data type in the sequence is a StringType, the widest common type becomes StringType (which was not the case prior, as an AnalysisException was raised).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded one test of Coalesce type coercion with the specific sequence of data types mentioned above and added onto a test of Union type coercion with a similar sequence of data types.\r\n\r\n_Please state that the contribution is your original work and that you license the work to the project under the project’s open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current code, if NM recovery is not enabled then `YarnShuffleService` will write shuffle metadata to NM local dir-1, if this local dir-1 is on bad disk, then `YarnShuffleService` will be failed to start. So to solve this issue, in Spark side if NM recovery is not enabled, then Spark will not persist data into leveldb, in that case yarn shuffle service can still be served but lose the ability for recovery, (it is fine because the failure of NM will kill the containers as well as applications).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in the local cluster with NM recovery off and on to see if folder is created or not. MiniCluster UT isn't added because in MiniCluster NM will always set port to 0, but NM recovery requires non-ephemeral port.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-24T03:49:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-31T01:29:10Z","closed_at":"2017-08-31T01:29:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54b4c825593054d63c993a74f4d661f7e467f25c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ebe0a24150f196df52daf1304b13e15454750db7","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-17321","ref":"SPARK-17321","sha":"ebe0a24150f196df52daf1304b13e15454750db7","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBecause of numerical error, MultivariateOnlineSummarizer.variance is possible to generate negative variance.\r\n\r\n**This is a serious bug because many algos in MLLib**\r\n**use stddev computed from** `sqrt(variance)`\r\n**it will generate NaN and crash the whole algorithm.**\r\n\r\nwe can reproduce this bug use the following code:\r\n```\r\n    val summarizer1 = (new MultivariateOnlineSummarizer)\r\n      .add(Vectors.dense(3.0), 0.7)\r\n    val summarizer2 = (new MultivariateOnlineSummarizer)\r\n      .add(Vectors.dense(3.0), 0.4)\r\n    val summarizer3 = (new MultivariateOnlineSummarizer)\r\n      .add(Vectors.dense(3.0), 0.5)\r\n    val summarizer4 = (new MultivariateOnlineSummarizer)\r\n      .add(Vectors.dense(3.0), 0.4)\r\n\r\n    val summarizer = summarizer1\r\n      .merge(summarizer2)\r\n      .merge(summarizer3)\r\n      .merge(summarizer4)\r\n\r\n    println(summarizer.variance(0))\r\n```\r\nThis PR fix the bugs in `mllib.stat.MultivariateOnlineSummarizer.variance` and `ml.stat.SummarizerBuffer.variance`, and several places in `WeightedLeastSquares`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntest cases added.","created_at":"2017-08-23T10:58:03Z","updated_at":"2017-08-28T10:28:03Z","closed_at":"2017-08-28T06:44:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"851ea79305d94cf0c1be6a41929ffd838fe696ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19029/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19029/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19029/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c40eba38d82893d5604aa66ec9037df706da712d","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:fix_summarizer_var_bug","ref":"fix_summarizer_var_bug","sha":"c40eba38d82893d5604aa66ec9037df706da712d","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile preparing to take over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16537, I realised a (I think) better approach to make the exception handling in one point.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix `_to_java_column` in `pyspark.sql.column`, which most of functions in `functions.py` and some other APIs use. This `_to_java_column` basically looks not working with other types than `pyspark.sql.column.Column` or string (`str` and `unicode`). \r\n\r\nIf this is not `Column`, then it calls `_create_column_from_name` which calls `functions.col` within JVM:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/42b9eda80e975d970c3e8da4047b318b83dd269f/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala#L76\r\n\r\nAnd it looks we only have `String` one with `col`.\r\n\r\nSo, these should work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.column import _to_java_column, Column\r\n>>> _to_java_column(\"a\")\r\nJavaObject id=o28\r\n>>> _to_java_column(u\"a\")\r\nJavaObject id=o29\r\n>>> _to_java_column(spark.range(1).id)\r\nJavaObject id=o33\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas these do not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> _to_java_column(1)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n...\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col. Trace:\r\npy4j.Py4JException: Method col([class java.lang.Integer]) does not exist\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> _to_java_column([])\r\n```\r\n```\r\n...\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col. Trace:\r\npy4j.Py4JException: Method col([class java.util.ArrayList]) does not exist\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> class A(): pass\r\n>>> _to_java_column(A())\r\n```\r\n```\r\n...\r\nAttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute '_get_object_id'\r\n```\r\n\r\nMeaning most of functions using `_to_java_column` such as `udf` or `to_json` or some other APIs throw an exception as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n>>> udf(lambda x: x)(None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col.\r\n: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import to_json\r\n>>> to_json(None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col.\r\n: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After this PR**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n>>> udf(lambda x: x)(None)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Invalid argument, not a string or column: None of type <type 'NoneType'>. For column literals, use 'lit', 'array', 'struct' or 'create_map' functions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import to_json\r\n>>> to_json(None)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Invalid argument, not a string or column: None of type <type 'NoneType'>. For column literals, use 'lit', 'array', 'struct' or 'create_map' functions.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests added in `python/pyspark/sql/tests.py` and manual tests.","created_at":"2017-08-23T09:21:15Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:37:52Z","closed_at":"2017-08-24T11:32:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef131e372bd9561030ee3fa127b03f0cfab07115","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4abaef78087a3b2ee6c86f7ea720ea356fe80353","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19165","ref":"SPARK-19165","sha":"4abaef78087a3b2ee6c86f7ea720ea356fe80353","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
