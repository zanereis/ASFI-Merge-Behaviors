What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR provides DataSourceV2 API support for structured streaming, including new pieces needed to support continuous processing [SPARK-20928]. High level summary:\r\n\r\n- DataSourceV2 includes new mixins to support micro-batch and continuous reads and writes. For reads, we accept an optional user specified schema rather than using the ReadSupportWithSchema model, because doing so would severely complicate the interface.\r\n\r\n- DataSourceV2Reader includes new interfaces to read a specific microbatch or read continuously from a given offset. These follow the same setter pattern as the existing Supports* mixins so that they can work with SupportsScanUnsafeRow.\r\n\r\n- DataReader (the per-partition reader) has a new subinterface ContinuousDataReader only for continuous processing. This reader has a special method to check progress, and next() blocks for new input rather than returning false.\r\n\r\n- Offset, an abstract representation of position in a streaming query, is ported to the public API. (Each type of reader will define its own Offset implementation.)\r\n\r\n- DataSourceV2Writer has a new subinterface ContinuousWriter only for continuous processing. Commits to this interface come tagged with an epoch number, as the execution engine will continue to produce new epoch commits as the task continues indefinitely.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not propose to change the existing DataSourceV2 batch API, or deprecate the existing streaming source/sink internal APIs in spark.sql.execution.streaming.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nToy implementations of the new interfaces with unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#19416 changed the format in which rows were encoded in the state store. However, this can break existing streaming queries with the old format in unpredictable ways (potentially crashing the JVM). Hence I am reverting this for now. This will be re-applied in the future after we start saving more metadata in checkpoints to signify which version of state row format the existing streaming query is running. Then we can decode old and new formats accordingly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn general, the SHS pages now use the public API types to represent applications. Some internal code paths still used its own view of what applications and attempts look like (`ApplicationHistoryInfo` and `ApplicationAttemptInfo`), declared in ApplicationHistoryProvider.scala.\r\n\r\nThis pull request removes these classes and updates the rest of the code to use `status.api.v1.ApplicationInfo` and `status.api.v1.ApplicationAttemptInfo` instead.\r\n\r\nFurthermore `status.api.v1.ApplicationInfo` and `status.api.v1.ApplicationAttemptInfo` were changed to case class to \r\n- facilitate copying instances\r\n- equality checking in test code\r\n- nicer toString() \r\n\r\nTo simplify the code a bit `v1.` prefixes were also removed from occurrences of v1.ApplicationInfo and v1.ApplicationAttemptInfo as there is no more ambiguity between classes in history and status.api.v1.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running existing automated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nwhen I run a application on yarn,I don't set the value of spark.executor.instances,so I think it's default value should as same as the running-on-yarn.md said is 2.But the log of driver logs \"spark.executor.instances less than spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors is invalid, ignoring its setting, please update your configs.\",so I know the default value of this configuration isn't 2.So I think we should fix it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore we deliver the Hive compatibility mode, we plan to write a set of test cases that can be easily run in both Spark and Hive sides. We can easily compare whether they are the same or not. When new typeCoercion rules are added, we also can easily track the changes. These test cases can also be backported to the previous Spark versions for determining the changes we made.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first attempt for improving the test coverage for type coercion compatibility. We generate these test cases for our binary comparison and ImplicitTypeCasts based on the Apache Derby test cases in https://github.com/apache/derby/blob/10.14/java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/implicitConversions.sql\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd additional test.  I plan to file an issue in SPARK Jira soon detailing this change.  It seems like there is an assumption in `.select` about some behavior that's not guaranteed by `Seq` but does exist in a `List`, because replacing `Stream` with `Seq` in the test causes it to pass.  Possibly this is due to Seq#map being lazy whereas List#map is eager.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current time complexity of ConstantPropagation is O(n^2), which can be slow when the query is complex.\r\nRefactor the implementation with O( n ) time complexity, and some pruning to avoid traversing the whole `Condition`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nAlso simple benchmark test in ConstantPropagationSuite\r\n```\r\n  val condition = (1 to 500).map{_ => Rand(0) === Rand(0)}.reduce(And)\r\n  val query = testRelation\r\n    .select(columnA)\r\n    .where(condition)\r\n  val start

order to enable truncate for PostgreSQL databases in Spark JDBC, a change is needed to the query used for truncating a PostgreSQL table. By default, PostgreSQL will automatically truncate any descendant tables if a TRUNCATE query is executed. As this may result in (unwanted) side-effects, the query used for the truncate should be specified separately for PostgreSQL, specifying only to TRUNCATE a single table.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd `getTruncateQuery` function to `JdbcDialect.scala`, with default query. Overridden this function for PostgreSQL to only truncate a single table. Also sets `isCascadingTruncateTable` to false, as this will allow truncates for PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests all pass.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nVia some test I found CrossValidator still exists memory issue, it will still occupy `O(n*sizeof(model))` memory for holding models when fitting, if well optimized, it should be `O(parallelism*sizeof(model))`\r\n\r\nThis is because modelFutures will hold the reference to model object after future is complete (we can use `future.value.get.get` to fetch it), and the `Future.sequence` and the `modelFutures` array holds references to each model future. So all model object are keep referenced. So it will still occupy `O(n*sizeof(model))` memory.\r\n\r\nI fix this by merging the `modelFuture` and `foldMetricFuture` together, and use `atomicInteger` to statistic complete fitting tasks and when all done, trigger `trainingDataset.unpersist`.\r\n\r\nI ever commented this issue on the old PR [SPARK-19357]\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16774#pullrequestreview-53674264\r\nunfortunately, at that time I do not realize that the issue still exists, but now I confirm it and create this PR to fix it.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\nI give 3 approaches which we can compare, after discussion I realized none of them is ideal, we have to make a trade-off.\r\n\r\n**After discussion with @jkbradley , choose approach 3**\r\n\r\n### Approach 1\r\n~~The approach proposed by @MrBago at~~ https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19904#discussion_r156751569\r\n~~This approach resolve the model objects referenced issue, allow the model objects to be GCed in time. **BUT, in some cases, it still do not resolve the O(N) model memory occupation issue**. Let me use an extreme case to describe it:~~\r\n~~suppose we set `parallelism = 1`, and there're 100 paramMaps. So we have 100 fitting & evaluation tasks. In this approach, because of `parallelism = 1`, the code have to wait 100 fitting tasks complete, **(at this time the memory occupation by models already reach 100 * sizeof(model) )** and then it will unpersist training dataset and then do 100 evaluation tasks.~~\r\n\r\n### Approach 2\r\n~~This approach is my PR old version code~~ https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19904/commits/2cc7c28f385009570536690d686f2843485942b2\r\n~~This approach can make sure at any case, the peak memory occupation by models to be `O(numParallelism * sizeof(model))`, but, it exists an issue that, in some extreme case, the \"unpersist training dataset\" will be delayed until most of the evaluation tasks complete. Suppose the case \r\n `parallelism = 1`, and there're 100 fitting & evaluation tasks, each fitting&evaluation task have to be executed one by one, so only after the first 99 fitting&evaluation tasks and the 100th fitting task complete, the \"unpersist training dataset\" will be triggered.~~\r\n\r\n### Approach 3\r\nAfter I compared approach 1 and approach 2, I realized that, in the case which parallelism is low but there're many fitting & evaluation tasks, we cannot achieve both of the following two goals:\r\n- Make the peak memory occupation by models(driver-side) to be O(parallelism * sizeof(model))\r\n- unpersist training dataset before most of the evaluation tasks started.\r\n\r\nSo I vote for a simpler approach, move the unpersist training dataset to the end (Does this really matters ?)\r\nBecause the goal 1 is more important, we must make sure the peak memory occupation by models (driver-side) to be O(parallelism * sizeof(model)), otherwise it will bring high risk of OOM.\r\nLike following code:\r\n```\r\n      val foldMetricFutures = epm.zipWithIndex.map { case (paramMap, paramIndex) =>\r\n        Future[Double] {\r\n          val model = est.fit(trainingDataset, paramMap).asInstanceOf[Model[_]]\r\n          //...other minor codes\r\n          val metric = eval.evaluate(model.transform(validationDataset, paramMap))\r\n          logDebug(s\"Got metric metricformodeltrainedwithparamMap.\")\r\n          metric\r\n        } (executionContext)\r\n      }\r\n      val foldMetrics = foldMetricFutures.map(ThreadUtils.awaitResult(_, Duration.Inf))\r\n      trainingDataset.unpersist() // <------- unpersist at the end\r\n      validationDataset.unpersist()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-06T03:17:26Z","updated_at":"2017-12-25T09:24:16Z","closed_at":"2017-12-25T07:00:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9bdc134ece1db58a13a3a1f43b87dd22deb43482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cad210439b7a0bc3eb870f1d68fd96fbd0763aa8","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:fix_cross_validator_memory_issue","ref":"fix_cross_validator_memory_issue","sha":"cad210439b7a0bc3eb870f1d68fd96fbd0763aa8","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR accomplishes the following two items.\r\n\r\n1. Reduce # of global variables from two to one for generated code of `Case` and `Coalesce` and remove global variables for generated code of `In`.\r\n2. Make lifetime of global variable local within an operation\r\n  \r\nItem 1. reduces # of constant pool entries in a Java class. Item 2. ensures that an variable is not passed to arguments in a method split by `CodegenContext.splitExpressions()`, which is addressed by #19865.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests into `PredicateSuite`, `NullExpressionsSuite`, and `ConditionalExpressionSuite`.","created_at":"2017-12-05T17:45:26Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T12:59:08Z","closed_at":"2017-12-07T12:59:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb6d6d692f8b13aecb562311795b286d81de3d69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4691b6b4cd8b2ac26dd9c89243372dfec5bb913","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-22705","ref":"SPARK-22705","sha":"c4691b6b4cd8b2ac26dd9c89243372dfec5bb913","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLots of our tests don't properly shutdown everything they create, and end up leaking lots of threads. For example, `TaskSetManagerSuite` doesn't stop the extra `TaskScheduler` and `DAGScheduler` it creates. There are a couple more instances, eg. in `DAGSchedulerSuite`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the possibility to print out the not properly stopped thread list after a test suite executed. The format is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n===== FINISHED o.a.s.scheduler.DAGSchedulerSuite: 'task end event should have updated accumulators (SPARK-20342)' =====\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n===== Global thread whitelist loaded with name /thread_whitelist from classpath: rpc-client.*, rpc-server.*, shuffle-client.*, shuffle-server.*' =====\r\n\r\nScalaTest-run: \r\n\r\n===== THREADS NOT STOPPED PROPERLY =====\r\n\r\nScalaTest-run: dag-scheduler-event-loop\r\nScalaTest-run: globalEventExecutor-2-5\r\nScalaTest-run: \r\n\r\n===== END OF THREAD DUMP =====\r\n\r\nScalaTest-run: \r\n\r\n===== EITHER PUT THREAD NAME INTO THE WHITELIST FILE OR SHUT IT DOWN PROPERLY =====\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the help of this leaking threads has been identified in TaskSetManagerSuite. My intention is to hunt down and fix such bugs in later PRs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual: TaskSetManagerSuite test executed and found out where are the leaking threads.\r\nAutomated: Pass the Jenkins.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-05T11:28:49Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T13:26:43Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T19:44:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1fd375dd742c3ec1a7c07678b1e32d281569776","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68d0f3beac63fefba436646896d5cd82a3c4da21","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-16139","ref":"SPARK-16139","sha":"68d0f3beac63fefba436646896d5cd82a3c4da21","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

have modified SparkHadoopMapReduceWriter so that executors and the driver always use consistent JobIds during the hadoop commit. Before SPARK-18191, spark always used the rddId, it just incorrectly named the variable stageId. After SPARK-18191, it used the rddId as the jobId on the driver's side, and the stageId as the jobId on the executors' side. With this change executors and the driver will consistently uses rddId as the jobId. Also with this change, during the hadoop commit protocol spark uses  actual stageId to check whether a stage can be committed unlike before that  it was using executors' jobId to do this check.\r\nIn addition to the existing unit tests, a test has been added to check whether executors and the driver are using the same JobId. The test failed before this change and passed after applying this fix.","created_at":"2017-12-05T00:08:16Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T17:22:36Z","closed_at":"2017-12-05T17:22:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6612dd613995cc47288e291a482a5d8f221f04c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0f4b495525010b2608148f992f3cf18c231411f","head":{"label":"rezasafi:stagerdd22","ref":"stagerdd22","sha":"b0f4b495525010b2608148f992f3cf18c231411f","user":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64172231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDE3MjIzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rezasafi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-20682, we have two `OrcFileFormat`s. This PR refactors ORC tests with three principles (with a few exceptions)\r\n1. Move test suite into `sql/core`.\r\n2. Create `HiveXXX` test suite in `sql/hive` by reusing `sql/core` test suite.\r\n3. `OrcTest` will provide common helper functions and `val orcImp: String`.\r\n\r\n**Test Suites**\r\n\r\n*Native OrcFileFormat*\r\n- org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc\r\n  - OrcFilterSuite\r\n  - OrcPartitionDiscoverySuite\r\n  - OrcQuerySuite\r\n  - OrcSourceSuite\r\n- o.a.s.sql.hive.orc\r\n  - OrcHadoopFsRelationSuite\r\n\r\n*Hive built-in OrcFileFormat*\r\n\r\n- o.a.s.sql.hive.orc\r\n  - HiveOrcFilterSuite\r\n  - HiveOrcPartitionDiscoverySuite\r\n  - HiveOrcQuerySuite\r\n  - HiveOrcSourceSuite\r\n  - HiveOrcHadoopFsRelationSuite\r\n\r\n**Hierarchy**\r\n```\r\nOrcTest\r\n    -> OrcSuite\r\n        -> OrcSourceSuite\r\n    -> OrcQueryTest\r\n        -> OrcQuerySuite\r\n    -> OrcPartitionDiscoveryTest\r\n        -> OrcPartitionDiscoverySuite\r\n    -> OrcFilterSuite\r\n\r\nHadoopFsRelationTest\r\n    -> OrcHadoopFsRelationSuite\r\n        -> HiveOrcHadoopFsRelationSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note the followings.\r\n- Unlike the other test suites, `OrcHadoopFsRelationSuite` doesn't inherit `OrcTest`. It is inside `sql/hive` like `ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite` due to the dependencies and follows the existing convention to use `val dataSourceName: String`\r\n- `OrcFilterSuite`s cannot reuse test cases due to the different function signatures using Hive 1.2.1 ORC classes and Apache ORC 1.4.1 classes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins tests with reorganized test suites.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-04T21:35:15Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T15:20:27Z","closed_at":"2017-12-07T12:46:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"984258b2d1dade2b80cebddf89133a82879d3ce4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f56423dd9168e781fad6e02e2aa319d8593d98cc","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-22672","ref":"SPARK-22672","sha":"f56423dd9168e781fad6e02e2aa319d8593d98cc","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f110a7f884cb09f01a20462038328ddc5662b46f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy default, the dynamic allocation will request enough executors to maximize the\r\nparallelism according to the number of tasks to process. While this minimizes the\r\nlatency of the job, with small tasks this setting can waste a lot of resources due to\r\nexecutor allocation overhead, as some executor might not even do any work.\r\nThis setting allows to set a ratio that will be used to reduce the number of\r\ntarget executors w.r.t. full parallelism.\r\n\r\nThe number of executors computed with this setting is still fenced by\r\n`spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors` and `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnits tests and runs on various actual workloads on a Yarn Cluster

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe SQL `Analyzer` goes through a whole query plan even most part of it is analyzed. This increases the time spent on query analysis for long pipelines in ML, especially.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a logical node called `AnalysisBarrier` that wraps an analyzed logical plan to prevent it from analysis again. The barrier is applied to the analyzed logical plan in `Dataset`. It won't change the output of wrapped logical plan and just acts as a wrapper to hide it from analyzer. New operations on the dataset will be put on the barrier, so only the new nodes created will be analyzed.\r\n\r\nThis analysis barrier will be removed at the end of analysis stage.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2017-12-04T07:18:31Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:02Z","closed_at":"2017-12-06T05:46:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfbc0534781d2c69cb25446b2ecba72b0fe65799","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19873/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19873/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19873/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2375e0185185cd3516b25c14b48c12840957cbf","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-20392-reopen","ref":"SPARK-20392-reopen","sha":"d2375e0185185cd3516b25c14b48c12840957cbf","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd support for using pandas UDFs with groupby().agg().\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new type of pandas UDF - group aggregate pandas UDF. This type of UDF defines a transformation of multiple pandas Series -> a scalar value. Group aggregate pandas UDFs can be used with groupby().agg(). Note group aggregate pandas UDF doesn't support partial aggregation, i.e., a full shuffle is required.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't support group aggregate pandas UDFs that return ArrayType, StructType or MapType. Support for these types is left for future PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code, it will scan all partition paths when `spark.sql.hive.verifyPartitionPath`=true.\r\ne.g. table like below:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE `test`(\r\n`id` int,\r\n`age` int,\r\n`name` string)\r\nPARTITIONED BY (\r\n`A` string,\r\n`B` string)\r\nload data local inpath '/tmp/data0' into table test partition(A='00', B='00')\r\nload data local inpath '/tmp/data1' into table test partition(A='01', B='01')\r\nload data local inpath '/tmp/data2' into table test partition(A='10', B='10')\r\nload data local inpath '/tmp/data3' into table test partition(A='11', B='11')\r\n```\r\nIf I query with SQL – \"select * from test where A='00' and B='01'  \", current code will scan all partition paths including '/data/A=00/B=00', '/data/A=00/B=00', '/data/A=01/B=01', '/data/A=10/B=10', '/data/A=11/B=11'. It costs much time and memory cost.\r\n\r\nThis pr introduces `spark.files.ignoreMissingFiles`. If true, Spark job will continue to run when encountering missing files and the contents that have been read will still be returned.  This is much like the logic brought by `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles`(which is for datasource scan).\r\n`spark.files.ignoreMissingFiles` can replace `spark.sql.hive.verifyPartitionPath`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that no global variables in arguments of method split by `CodegenContext.splitExpressions()`. This PR asserts this condition.\r\n\r\nIf there are a global variables in split method by `CodegenContext.splitExpressions() `, the following problem may occur. When variables in arguments are declared as local variables, to assign a value to the variable, which has been originally declared as a global variable, updates a local variable.\r\n\r\nEach code generator has to ensure there is no such a case.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Test {\r\n  int globalInt;\r\n\r\n  void splittedFunction(int globalInt) {\r\n    ...\r\n    globalInt = 2;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  void apply() {\r\n    globalInt = 1;\r\n    ...\r\n    splittedFunction(globalInt);\r\n    // globalInt should be 2 here since it is 2 if statements are not split\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SortMergeJoin(with wholeStageCodegen), an optimization already exists: if the left table of a partition is empty then there is no need to read the right table of this corresponding partition. This benefits the case in which many partitions of left table is empty and the right table is big.\r\n\r\nWhile in the code path without wholeStageCodegen, this optimization doesn't happen. This is mainly due to the lack of optimization in codegen-SortMergeJoin & the lack of support in `SortExec`, which doesn't do lazy evaluation.

are fetched.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that, in \"Operator Optimizations\" batch, `ColumnPruning` first produces a `Project` on table `base`, but then it's removed by `removeProjectBeforeFilter`. Because at that time, the predicate subquery is in filter form. Then, in \"Rewrite Subquery\" batch, `RewritePredicateSubquery` converts the subquery into a LeftSemi join, but this batch doesn't have the `ColumnPruning` rule. This results in reading all columns for the `base` table.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test

have modified SparkHadoopWriter so that executors and the driver always use consistent JobIds during the hadoop commit. Before SPARK-18191, spark always used the rddId, it just incorrectly named the variable stageId. After SPARK-18191, it used the rddId as the jobId on the driver's side, and the stageId as the jobId on the executors' side. With this change executors and the driver will consistently uses rddId as the jobId. Also with this change, during the hadoop commit protocol spark uses  actual stageId to check whether a stage can be committed unlike before that  it was using executors' jobId to do this check.\r\nIn addition to the existing unit tests, a test has been added to check whether executors and the driver are using the same JobId. The test failed before this change and passed after applying this fix.","created_at":"2017-11-29T17:20:26Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T19:28:51Z","closed_at":"2017-12-04T17:26:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"178347bff2bdc46428057ac4255a956ac5afbb00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e6868395e9291ad8ddf2a0251f7e6163618b132","head":{"label":"rezasafi:stagerddsimple","ref":"stagerddsimple","sha":"8e6868395e9291ad8ddf2a0251f7e6163618b132","user":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64172231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDE3MjIzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rezasafi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe need to add some helper code to make testing ML transformers & models easier with streaming data. These tests might help us catch any remaining issues and we could encourage future PRs to use these tests to prevent new Models & Transformers from having issues.\r\n\r\nI add a `MLTest` trait which extends `StreamTest` trait, and override `createSparkSession`. So ML testsuite can only extend `MLTest`, to use both ML & Stream test util functions.\r\n\r\nI only modify one testcase in `LinearRegressionSuite`, for first pass review.\r\n\r\nLink to #19746 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`MLTestSuite`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose that BlockManagerMasterEndpoint.removeRdd() should catch and log any IOExceptions it receives. As it is now, the exception can bubble up to the main thread and kill user applications when called from RDD.unpersist(). I think this change is a better experience for the end user.\r\n\r\nI chose to catch the exception in BlockManagerMasterEndpoint.removeRdd() instead of RDD.unpersist() because this way the RDD.unpersist() blocking option will still work correctly. Otherwise, blocking will get short circuited by the first error. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested with a job that shows the job killing behavior mentioned above. \r\n\r\n@rxin, it looks like you originally wrote this method, I would appreciate it if you took a look.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImage test seems failed in Python 3.6.0 / NumPy 1.13.3. I manually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\nERROR: test_read_images (pyspark.ml.tests.ImageReaderTest)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/ml/tests.py\", line 1831, in test_read_images\r\n    self.assertEqual(ImageSchema.toImage(array, origin=first_row[0]), first_row)\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/ml/image.py\", line 149, in toImage\r\n    data = bytearray(array.astype(dtype=np.uint8).ravel())\r\nTypeError: only integer scalar arrays can be converted to a scalar index\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 1 test in 7.606s\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I think the error seems from NumPy - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/75b2d5d427afdb1392f2a0b2092e0767e4bab53d/numpy/core/src/multiarray/number.c#L947\r\n\r\nFor a smaller scope:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> bytearray(np.array([1]).astype(dtype=np.uint8))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: only integer scalar arrays can be converted to a scalar index\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Python 2.7 / NumPy 1.13.1, it prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbytearray(b'\\x01')\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, here, I simply worked around it by converting it to bytes as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> bytearray(np.array([1]).astype(dtype=np.uint8).tobytes())\r\nbytearray(b'\\x01')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, while looking into it again, I realised few arguments could be quite confusing, for example, `Row` that needs some specific attributes and `numpy.ndarray`. I added few type checking and added some tests accordingly. So, it shows an error message as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: array argument should be numpy.ndarray; however, it got [<class 'str'>].\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with `./python/run-tests`.\r\n\r\nAnd also:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 SPARK_TESTING=1 bin/pyspark pyspark.ml.tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a way to explicitly range-partition a Dataset. So far, only round-robin and hash partitioning were possible via `df.repartition(...)`, but sometimes range partitioning might be desirable: e.g. when writing to disk, for better compression without the cost of global sort.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation piggybacks on the existing `RepartitionByExpression` `LogicalPlan` and simply adds the following logic: If its expressions are of type `SortOrder`, then it will do `RangePartitioning`; otherwise `HashPartitioning`.
