PR includes a few changes in `www/security.py`:\r\n\r\n- Correct type hint for dag_id (`str` rather than `int`)\r\n- Use DAG name without prefix \"DAG:\" in logging (line 644)\r\n- Avoid unnecessary duplicated operation (line 653. Duplicated with line 648)\r\n\r\nAn addition change is added in the 2nd commit:\r\n- Clean-up the logic in `update_admin_perm_view()`: Because `RESOURCE_DAG_PREFIX` is \"DAG:\" and `RESOURCE_DAG` is \"DAGs\", if we have `view_menu_id.in_(pv_ids)`, we can be sure that `view_menu_id != all_dag_view.id`. So we can remove 2nd condition. By making this change, we have cleaner logic, and can avoid some talks to DB (`self.find_view_menu(permissions.RESOURCE_DAG)`) so we have a bit better performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The performance of `get_accessible_dags()` is improved simply by returning as early as possible\r\n\r\n- All the changes made in `www.views.py` are based on the fact that the check against `permissions.RESOURCE_DAG` is already handled inside `get_accessible_dags()`, which is invoked by `get_accessible_dag_ids()` then. Comparing `permissions.RESOURCE_DAG` with the result of `get_accessible_dag_ids()` is not making sense. The lines inside these `IF`-clauses are either always executed or never executed (I believe these chunks were not cleaned-up after the relevant code changes in `get_accessible_dag_ids()` happened)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11423\r\n\r\nIn this PR I made the following changes:\r\n- I split the documentation generation process for each package separately. Now we are not building one documentation for the entire Airflow, but we are building documentation for the core and for each provider separately. \r\n- The documentation for the Python API for each provider has been migrated to the provider's documentation.\r\n- For apache-airflow-providers-googoe all (almost all documentation) was migrated.\r\n- An extension has been prepared, which facilitates the creation of links between documents i.e. if you write `:class: airlfow.providers......` anywhere in the documentation a working link to the documentation in a good package will be generated.\r\n- RTD is not enough anymore, so documentation is built on CI / CD and published on S3.\r\n\r\nPreview: http://apache-airflow-docs.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/\r\n\r\nIn this PR, a few things are still WIP:\r\n\r\n- [x] clean-up code\r\n- [x] documentation on building documentation\r\n\r\nIn next PRs, I will deal with the following things:\r\n- The documentation will use the official Apache Airflow theme\r\n- Improve the process of publishing the documentation on airflow-site\r\n- migrate the content of the documentation to the provider documentations\r\n- move the documentation for `apache-airflow` to the` apache-airflow` directory.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
