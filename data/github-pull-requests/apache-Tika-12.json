It\ncomprises an SDK and tooling for composing and running analytic components written in Java and C++,\nwith some support for Perl, Python and TCL.</p>\n<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Notable changes in this release<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>\n<p>This is a bug fix release.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/304\">#304</a>: - Unable to deserialize CAS if last element on the heap is an empty array by <a href=\"https://github.com/reckart\"><code>@​reckart</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/pull/305\">apache/uima-uimaj#305</a></li>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/306\">#306</a>: Cannot install Ruta 3.3.0 workbench against UIMA 3.4.0 Eclipse plugins by <a href=\"https://github.com/reckart\"><code>@​reckart</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/pull/307\">apache/uima-uimaj#307</a></li>\n<li>🦟 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/303\">#303</a>: Build fails on Windows if namespace contains whitespace by <a href=\"https://github.com/reckart\"><code>@​reckart</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/pull/309\">apache/uima-uimaj#309</a></li>\n<li>🩹 Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/issues/302\">#302</a>: Update dependencies by <a href=\"https://github.com/reckart\"><code>@​reckart</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/apache/uima-uimaj/pull/308\">apache/uima-uimaj#308</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/uima-uimaj/compare/rel/uimaj-3.4.0...uimaj-3.4.1\">https://github.com/apache/uima-uimaj/compare/rel/uimaj-3.4.0...uimaj-3.4.1</a></p>\n<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to Get Involved<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added explicit support for <code>text</code>-based serialization, this is done by adding <code>SerializerEncoding.TEXT</code>. Previously,\n<code>text</code> was being implicitly supported by using <code>SerializerEncoding.JSON</code> but there were edge cases when a <code>String</code>\nwasn't a JSON string (<code>string</code> vs <code>&quot;string&quot;</code>). (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32277\">#32277</a>)</li>\n<li>Added <code>BinaryData.fromListByteBuffer(List&lt;ByteBuffer&gt;)</code> to support additional ways to create <code>BinaryData</code>. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32932\">#32932</a>)</li>\n<li>Added <code>TracingOptions</code> to make tracing configurable. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32573\">#32573</a>)</li>\n<li>Added support for links, start timestamp, W3C trace-context propagation, and numerical attributes in tracing.</li>\n<li>Tracing plugins are no longer required to implement <code>AfterRetryPolicyProvider</code> as tracing is now handled by\n<code>InstrumentationPolicy</code> using the provided <code>Tracer</code> implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated messaging-specific methods in tracing abstractions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>PollingStrategy.getResult</code> would guard getting results for <code>POST</code>-based on containing a <code>Location</code>\nheader which isn't guaranteed to exist. If the header doesn't exist the body of the last polling operation is used\nas the final result. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32815\">#32815</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where <code>HEAD</code>-based requests were checking for a body before deserializing. <code>HEAD</code> requests shouldn't have\na body or if they do it should be ignored. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/32833\">#32833</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptions when deserializing error HTTP responses now include the deserialization exception as the causal exception\nin addition to logging it.</li>\n<li><code>ExpandableStringEnum</code> now uses <code>MethodHandle</code> instead of <code>Constructor</code> to create subtype instances when using\n<code>fromString(String, Class&lt;T&gt;)</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/92c9bacc4b4772e0edfb7c9623cb0efc24fc3c56\"><code>92c9bac</code></a> Only Depend on Live Test Stages for Manual Builds (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33274\">#33274</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/6ddb120f8644f61e4fffed945c63b9e0a7d7adea\"><code>6ddb120</code></a> Add disable instance discovery (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33225\">#33225</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/27ba1ab5054fd6028dd8242261b830df08b7aa06\"><code>27ba1ab</code></a> Don't Run Live Test Stages on IndividualCI Build Reasons (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33272\">#33272</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/cbe8b98ca3d20e7637f051ae0902d37bc39bf472\"><code>cbe8b98</code></a> Prepare Core Libraries for Feb 2023 Release (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33271\">#33271</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/4eb544f58a197d52f53ee0c705faaa211a545550\"><code>4eb544f</code></a> Updates to Stream Serialization Libraries (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33270\">#33270</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/40c85244761d6bd676eda4a65626e197262edaef\"><code>40c8524</code></a> Consume cosmos emulator from install path on agent (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33265\">#33265</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/045f300ea157c3de3a37e76f8fdcc1469bfc8fc7\"><code>045f300</code></a> Increment versions for loadtesting releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33264\">#33264</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/62d47bc5c14dae51fdfde46a8648f7e2dc314121\"><code>62d47bc</code></a> fix wrong javadocs of withSsh (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33211\">#33211</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/771e70ee289a8ec65514c08a0ea55d69227475bf\"><code>771e70e</code></a> Sync eng/common directory with azure-sdk-tools for PR 5272 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33254\">#33254</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/54e34e3347b155c05f089c4a2e04d49787ee8bbf\"><code>54e34e3</code></a> One time repo setup for running Cadl scripts (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33251\">#33251</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/compare/azure-core_1.35.0...azure-core_1.36.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.azure:azure-core&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.35.0&new-version=1.36.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Snappy 1.1.9. Currently, only a limited number of platforms are supported, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Win32/64 (Only Intel)</li>\n<li>Mac64 (Intel, M1, M2).

If a cross compiler for your platform is not available, create a PR with a native library built with <code>make native</code> command.</p>\n<h2>🚀 Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add uncompressDoubleArray
