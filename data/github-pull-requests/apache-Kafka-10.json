The share coordinator writes state to the internal topic `__share_group_state`. This topic is not compacted.\r\n* To prevent the size of partitions of the topic to become unwieldy, we would want to prune this topic periodically.\r\n* Since the disk log can only supports prefix based delete, we require the knowledge of the last redundant offset below which the partition can be truncated. This PR introduces a class which manages the state to calculate the said offset.\r\n* Tests have also been added.

Summary\r\nThis pull request introduces a new script, develocity_reports.py, designed to enhance our detailed reports on flaky tests. It leverages the Develocity API to fetch and analyze test results, focusing on identifying and reporting quarantined tests with high failure rates. The script is intended to help developers/CI quickly identify problematic tests that require attention, thereby improving the overall quality of our codebase.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- New Script Addition: Introduced develocity_reports.py to the .github/scripts directory.\r\n- Functionality:\r\n  - Fetches test results from the Develocity API for a specified project and test type.\r\n  - Analyzes test outcomes to identify flaky and failed tests.\r\n  - Generates reports highlighting high-priority quarantined tests based on failure rates and quarantine duration.\r\n  - Provides detailed timelines and statistics for each test and test case.\r\n- Logging: Integrated logging to track the script's execution and handle exceptions gracefully.\r\n- Configuration: Allows configuration of API base URL, authentication token, project name, and thresholds for quarantine and failure rates.\r\n- Output: Produces a console report summarizing the most problematic tests, including detailed statistics and recent execution timelines.\r\n\r\n###Updates\r\n\r\n- Added support for two more reporting types - identify flaky test regressions, clear tests from quarantine.\r\n- Added support for caching build info in github action cache. This will speed up the report generation without pulling build info of the entire date range everytime. It will only pull the delta date range.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Manual tested. Example output would be like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.kafka.tiered.storage.integration.OffloadAndTxnConsumeFromLeaderTest\r\n==============================================================================\r\nQuarantined for 14 days\r\nContainer Failure Rate: 14.51%\r\nRecent Failure Rate: 14.51%\r\n\r\nContainer Statistics:\r\n  Total Runs: 1013\r\n  Failed: 4\r\n  Flaky: 143\r\n  Passed: 866\r\n\r\nContainer Recent Executions:\r\n  Date/Time (UTC)      Outcome    Build ID\r\n  ------------------------------------------------\r\n  2024-11-25 02:51  passed     5kqy57pu3uwxs\r\n  2024-11-25 03:18  passed     rgjbtcmlfk7so\r\n  2024-11-25 03:18  passed     hhko6esalsqco\r\n  2024-11-25 03:30  passed     i35nqmpusibpw\r\n  2024-11-25 03:31  flaky      jddx23jdksg5m\r\n\r\nTest Cases (Last 7 Days):\r\n  ------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  → executeTieredStorageTest(String, String)[1]\r\n    Failure Rate: 10.92%\r\n    Runs: 476 | Failed:   0 | Flaky:  52 | Passed: 424\r\n\r\n    Recent Executions:\r\n    Date/Time (UTC)      Outcome    Build ID\r\n    --------------------------------------------\r\n    2024-11-25 03:18  passed     hhko6esalsqco\r\n    2024-11-25 03:30  passed     i35nqmpusibpw\r\n    2024-11-25 03:31  flaky      jddx23jdksg5m\r\n\r\n  → executeTieredStorageTest(String, String)[2]\r\n    Failure Rate: 5.25%\r\n    Runs: 476 | Failed:   0 | Flaky:  25 | Passed: 451\r\n\r\n    Recent Executions:\r\n    Date/Time (UTC)      Outcome    Build ID\r\n    --------------------------------------------\r\n    2024-11-25 03:18  passed     hhko6esalsqco\r\n    2024-11-25 03:30  passed     i35nqmpusibpw\r\n    2024-11-25 03:31  passed     jddx23jdksg5m\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Testing for the new report types.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSummary for PR:\r\n==============\r\n\r\n1.

are two issues in KAFKA-18060:\r\n1) New coordinator can't handle the TxnOffsetCommitRequest with empty member id, and TxnOffsetCommitRequest v0-v2 do definitely has an empty member ID, causing ConsumerGroup#validateOffsetCommit to throw an UnknownMemberIdException. This prevents the old producer from calling sendOffsetsToTransaction. Note that TxnOffsetCommitRequest versions v0-v2 are included in KIP-896, so it seems the new coordinator should support that operations\r\n\r\n2) The deprecated API Producer#sendOffsetsToTransaction does not use v0-v2 to send TxnOffsetCommitRequest with an empty member ID. Unfortunately, it has been released for a while. Therefore, the new coordinator needs to handle TxnOffsetCommitRequest with an empty member ID for all versions.\r\n\r\nTaken from the two issues above, we need to handle empty member id in all API versions when new coordinator are dealing with TxnOffsetCommitRequest.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

was a bug in handling the `ShareAcknowledgeResponse` for `commitAsync()`. Currently after we receive a response, we send out a background event to the application thread to update the acknowledgement commit callbacks for EVERY `TopicIdPartition`.\r\nThe map that was sent was not cleared after sending the event. This meant we ended up sending responses for partitions that were already sent in the previous event. So there will be duplicate calls to the callback.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes the bug and adds a unit test for the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the implementation for KIP-1112 ([KAFKA-18026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-18026)). In order to have DSL operators be properly wrapped by the interface suggestion in 1112, we need to make sure they all use the `ConnectedStoreProvider#stores` method to connect stores instead of manually calling `addStateStore`.\r\n\r\n### Review Guide\r\n\r\n1. Checkout `KTableSource` which now implements the `stores()` method\r\n2. GlobalKTables no longer hack materialized by setting the source name on the builder, instead we pipe a `forceQueryable` into `MaterializedInternal` so that we directly indicate that it should be queryable/materialized instead of relying on a side effect of setting the store name\r\n3. `StoreDelegatingProcessorSupplier` is used only in the case of GlobalKTables because the stores are expected to be passed in separately in the public API -- this PR doesn't change that\r\n4. `FactoryWrappingStoreBuilder` is used so that already created store factories can be typecast as `StoreBuilder`s. \r\n\r\n**NOTE:** For point (3), I think this might be a bug in the current implementation that we may want to change in 4.0 since it's backwards incompatible. If you pass in a `ProcessorSupplier` to `addGlobalTable`, the `stores()` method on that will be ignored.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis is a refactor only, there is no new behaviors.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

PR includes the API for KIP-1112 and a partial implementation, which wraps any processors added through the PAPI and the DSL processors that are written to the topology through the ProcessorParameters#addProcessorTo method.\r\n\r\nFurther PRs will complete the implementation by converting the remaining DSL operators to using the #addProcessorTo method, and future-proof the processor writing mechanism to prevent new DSL operators from being implemented incorrectly/without the

the validation of feature upgrade relies on the supported version range generated during registration. For a given feature, its max supported feature version in production is set to be the default version value (the latest feature version with bootstrap metadata value smaller or equal to the latest production metadata value). \r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a `LATEST_PRODUCTION` value independent from the metadata version to each feature so that the highest supported feature version can be customized by the feature owner. \r\n\r\nThe change only applies to dynamic feature upgrade. During formatting, we still use the default value associated the metadata version.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

#17298.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a simple label based workflow for PRs. PRs opened by non-committers will have a `triage` label automatically added. This allows committers to see which PRs need to be triaged. After 7 days, a `needs-attention` label will be added. This serves as a reminder to committers and allows them to see which PRs have languished.\r\n\r\nFor now, the `triage` label will need to be manually removed by a committer. In the future, we could try to automate this by removing the label after a PR has been reviewed, assigned, or commented on.","created_at":"2024-11-20T18:04:19Z","updated_at":"2024-12-15T15:18:32Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T17:34:09Z","merged_at":"2024-12-10T17:34:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8dadb741c1a6f6c44d8e058ff5863f3e29528d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

About\r\nThis PR aims to remove `partitionMaxBytes` from share fetch requests(SFR). In the current flow, we cannot fetch more than 1 MB for each topic partition in the share fetch request by default although the overall SFR max bytes is 50MB. This PR has removed this limit by using strategies from a strategy class `PartitionMaxBytesStrategy`.\r\n`PartitionMaxBytesStrategy` contains  an `UNIFORM` strategy that divides overall SFR max bytes equally among the acquired topic partitions. For example -  If SFR max bytes = 50MB and there are 5 acquired topic partitions, then total data that can be fetched for each topic partition from replica manager can be upto 10MB each. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded unit tests for `PartitionMaxBytesStrategy` and tested with already present unit tests on broker and integration tests for share consumers\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-20T05:59:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T15:06:38Z","closed_at":"2025-01-13T13:56:19Z","merged_at":"2025-01-13T13:56:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e24c50ba3e73b50ec667600b46f8938f40c7dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

patch introduces the asynchronous resolution of regular expressions. Let me unpack a few details about the implementations:\r\n1) I have decided to finally update all the regular expressions within a consumer group together. My assumption is that the number of regular expressions in a group will be generally small but the number of topics in a cluster is large. Hence grouping has two benefits. Firstly, it allows to go through the list of topics once for all the regular expressions. Secondly, it reduces the number of potential rebalances because all the regular expressions are updated at the same time.\r\n2) An update is triggered when the group is subscribed to at least one regular expressions.\r\n3) An update is triggered when there is no ongoing update.\r\n4) An update is triggered only of the previous one is older than 10s.\r\n5) An update is triggered when the group has unresolved regular expressions.\r\n6) An update is triggered when the metadata image has new topics.\r\n\r\nNote that I opted for not triggered an upgrade when topics are deleted. For those, the subscription metadata will be updated hence the deleted topics are removed via this path. The resolved regular expressions will remove the deleted topics on the next refresh.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

[KAFKA-14562](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14562), we implemented epoch bump on both the client and the server.

No Epoch Bump Allowed\r\n\t•\tcoordinatorSupportsBumpingEpoch = false when initPIDVersion < 3 or initPIDVersion = null.\r\n\r\n2. Client-Triggered Epoch Bump Allowed\r\n\t•\tcoordinatorSupportsBumpingEpoch = true when initPIDVersion >= 3.\r\n\t•\tTransactionVersion2Enabled = false when endTxnVersion < 5.\r\n\r\n3. Only Server-Triggered Epoch Bump Allowed\r\n\t•\tTransactionVersion2Enabled = true and endTxnVersion >= 5.\r\n\r\nWe want to refine the code and make it more structured to correctly handle epoch bumping in the above mentioned cases.\r\n\r\nThe changes made in this patch are:\r\n\r\n- Rename epochBumpRequired to epochBumpTriggerRequired to symbolize a manual epoch bump request from the client
