This is because $ref works by replacing itself and everything on its level with the definition it is pointing at.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the `state` field was incorrectly showing up in the API docs for the trigger DagRun endpoint:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1311\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 9 36 37 AM\"

using aiobotocore, we are pinning botocore and boto to a specific\r\nversion (in aiobotocore extra of amazon provider). This means that\r\nthe boto/botocore dependencies will be updated less frequent in main\r\n(every 3-4 months instead of every few days). This has the danger,\r\nthat we will detect errors resulting from the upgrade much later,\r\nso we should run our amazon tests and depending tests with\r\nthe latest boto/botocore (having aibotocore uninstalled).\r\n\r\nAll deferrable tests should skip when aiobotocore is missing so only\r\nnon-deferrable tests should run in this job.\r\n\r\nDepends on #30127 (so only last commit should be checked).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

seen that every once in a while, an eks system test will fail with a timeout on the pod starting. \r\nSince we delete all resources in the teardown, we're pretty clueless on what's happening, and the failures appear to be random so we cannot reproduce it in a controlled environment.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we'll get at least a pod description if there is a failure, which should help us understand the root cause.\r\n\r\nThis step is run only on failure (`trigger_rule=TriggerRule.ONE_FAILED`), expecting to run after the start_pod operation failed. It is possible that an earlier step would fail and trigger this, but that's how life is. The main point is that we don't want to run it every single time because it makes the test ~1 minute longer (installing awscli, necessary to get the kube config, is quite long).","created_at":"2023-03-15T19:29:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T17:44:12Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T00:16:57Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T00:16:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c4761aa37812981fa186ea6cc60d74a7705fa7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

ORM in SQLAlchemy is significant in some commands that don't need the ORM otherwise (e.g. webserver, since the ORM is only needed in Gunicorn workers, not the parent process). This eliminates ORM access from all SELECT queries so SQLAlchemy configuration is minimal unless we detect the need to insert something into the database.\r\n\r\nTo keep complexity reasonable, ORM is still used for queries that write data to the database. Writing things requires SQLALchemy to do more anyway and the ORM configuration overhead is not significant to worth the trouble IMO. We can always revisit this later if needed.","created_at":"2023-03-15T11:37:57Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T21:37:25Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T11:32:47Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T11:32:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"696b91fafe4a557f179098e0609eb9d9dcb73f72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

#22474 \r\n\r\n- This commit is to fix the inconsistent returned value of `airflow dags next-execution` cli command when the dag is paused and catchup is False\r\n\r\nIn brief:\r\n- When the dag is unpaused, the cli command would get the next-execution run from the `DagRun` model. However, when the dag is paused, getting the next-execution run from the `DagRun` model would yield the next dag run time from the last executed dag run, which is incorrect as time passes.\r\n- To avoid this, we can get the next-execution run time from `dag_model.next_dag_run` (as in: [dag.html L143](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/templates/airflow/dag.html#L143)) to make it more consistent with the UI.\r\n\r\nModification:\r\n- Use only the `DagModel` to get a dag next execution info. This way we could:\r\n  - Handle the `catchup=False` case and when the Dag is paused.\r\n  - Handle the case of next execution info is `None` when `args.num_executions` is specified. Previous code will throw an error as follow: None type has no attribute logical_date ...\r\n  - Modify test case to handle all dag parsing scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR, please let me know if there is anything I could do differently.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.","created_at":"2023-03-15T10:19:05Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T22:04:43Z","closed_at":"2023-03-22T14:22:39Z","merged_at":"2023-03-22T14:22:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"c63836ccb763fd078e0665c7ef3353146b1afe96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/25149\r\n\r\n- fix `needs_perms` logical error.\r\n- If a DAG’s `access_control` is empty, permission-sync is skipped entirely. I think it should check whether there’s existing permission configurations and reset those if needed instead.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR, so if there is anything else I should do, please let me know.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/30075\r\n\r\nThis allows incoming API requests to create DAGs in non-queued states (`running`, `success`, `failed`), which is more consistent with the documentation. \r\n\r\nAs-per the original issue, I'm not sure whether:\r\n - The code is wrong (in which case this is the correct fix)\r\n  - The documentation generated from the OpenAPI spec is wrong (which is due to the reference overriding the readOnly attribute

[here](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3445#issuecomment-339649576)).\r\n  \r\nLet me know what you think, and if you think that this functionality is undesirable then I can update my

#30097\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe triggerer job [logs the trigger name](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/jobs/triggerer_job.py#L592-L593), which is [repr(trigger_instance)](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/jobs/triggerer_job.py#L488), so it logs all the fields in the `trigger_instance` even if they contain sensitive. We have some different options to fix this:\r\n- use [redact](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/utils/log/secrets_masker.py#L111-L111) in `__repr__` method -> difficult to detect all the sensitive information\r\n- add a new attribute to hide some fields -> it can work, but we need to identify all the sensitive fields in each new trigger\r\n- simply change the trigger name -> IMHO it's the best solution, also the trigger name should be significant and related to the task instance\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-15T00:14:46Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T16:51:25Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T11:59:18Z","merged_at":"2023-04-06T11:59:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"274d9c3508179ae8b0f705d9787e8200be7718e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

good.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81631424/225090602-914cd52c-fa6c-4762-98c4-89169fae4c73.png)\r\n\r\nBut i think it's better to use repr(e) than str(e) for showing error class name on web UI message.\r\n\r\n`self.import_errors[dag.fileloc] = str(e)` -> `self.import_errors[dag.fileloc] = repr(e)`\r\n\r\nIn other exception cases(=error on DAG module itself), there are `traceback` related configurations to show error traceback on the web UI.\r\n```python\r\n    self.dagbag_import_error_tracebacks = conf.getboolean('core', 'dagbag_import_error_tracebacks')\r\n    self.dagbag_import_error_traceback_depth = conf.getint('core', 'dagbag_import_error_traceback_depth')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, I think, use of error traceback on this case is a bit too much, but it's enough to show exception class name on the Import Error Web UI\r\n- AirflowTimetableInvalid\r\n- AirflowClusterPolicyViolation\r\n- AirflowClusterPolicyError\r\n- AirflowDagCycleException\r\n-

Airflow uses its heuristic rules to check if a py file has DAGs defined or not by checking if `dag` or `airflow` in the file content. This generally works well however for cases with lots of py files, it could lead to lots of false positive. This change allows users to have more flexible rules to meet their needs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

the problem with creating URL for the taskinstance. \r\n\r\nWhen you go to /taskinstance/list/ URL every runid in the table would be without the execution_date query param, which will cause a redirect to the latest graph when clicking on it instead of needed. That happened because execution_date was not found in attrs because of a spelling mistake. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the serde modules for kubernetes and numpy are loaded on startup which are notriously slow, even if they are never used.\r\n\r\nThis changes the behavior of those modules to lazy load them and adds

#7999\r\n\r\nWhen performing a next value calculation using a cron schedule with a non-fixed interval (e.g. `* 1,2,3 * * *`), changes in timezone are not properly accounted for. The functions `_get_next` and `_get_prev` do not account for the delta between the `current` and `scheduled` values' respective timezones.

When is an error code not an error code?\r\n\r\nThe `BashOperator` has a `skip_exit_code` param, which is used to identify the return code from the underlying command which means 'this task hasn't failed, but should instead be skipped'.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds something similar to the `BashSensor`: a `retry_exit_code` that (if set) defines the only non-zero return code that _doesn't_ cause the sensor to fail. All other non-zero return codes result in the sensor failing.\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility, if the code is not set (which is the default) then you get the current behaviour which is for all non-zero return codes to cause the sensor to retry the check, i.e. it retries until timeout or it returns zero.\r\n\r\n# Why is this useful?\r\n\r\n If your sensor is e.g. spinning up a docker container and you get some flags wrong, then under the current behaviour the sensor will never succeed, but also never fail until it times out. It would be much more useful if you could detect malformed commands immediately (fail fast).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-13T22:10:15Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T21:18:50Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T15:13:18Z","merged_at":"2023-03-15T15:13:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f02e8413fd6dd8c637a2111f6912f5b5d0202f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

Let's make SLA's work\r\n\r\nOK, so https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/25147 made a start in this direction. Summing up the, er, summary from that MR, the problem was that SLA callbacks could keep occuring, and prevent the dag processor manager from ever processing more than 2 or 3 dags in the queue before the SLA callbacks re-upped and went to the front of the queue.\r\n\r\nAfter that PR was merged, the SLA callbacks went to the back of the queue. This guaranteed that the queue would be processed at least once. However, it turns out that dags on disk would only be re-added to the queue once the queue was empty. But with SLA callbacks arriving All. The. Time. the queue would never drain, and we'd never re-read dags from disk. So if you updated the dag file, you'd have to bounce the scheduler to pick up the change, and then it would process all non-SLA-generating DAGs exactly once. And then you'd need to bounce again.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/15596 (I hope!)\r\n\r\n# Pay attention, here comes the science bit\r\n\r\nOk, so to briefly recap the queue behaviour prior to this change:\r\n1. The scheduler spins up.\r\n2. The worker loop starts.\r\n3. It scans the disk to create a list of all known files. _It does not add these files to the queue_.\r\n4. If the queue is empty (on start up it will be) then all known files are added to the queue.\r\n5. It then spins up dag processors (via multiprocessing or in-line, depending on set up) to consume the first N entries in the queue (where N is a function of config settings, and includes a count of any files currently being processed from a previous pass of the loop)\r\n6. It then goes back to step 2.\r\n\r\n- Note that Step 3 is re-run periodically based on a time interval set in config (`dag_dir_list_interval`). It does not require that the queue be empty. Any changes to the set of files on disk e.g. dags being deleted will cause the manager to remove dags from the queue.\r\n- After a few iterations of the loop, the contents of the queue are processed, and step 4 kicks in, and the dag files present on disk are re-added to the queue again.\r\n    - The default config is to do this no more than once every 30 seconds (`min_file_process_interval`), so if your dag files only take 10 seconds to process, there will be 20 seconds of idle time, but if your dag files take a minute to process, then the manager will be permanently busy, because as soon as the queue drains, it'll be well past time to reload the queue from disk.\r\n    - This only works if the queue _actually empties_ - as foreshadowed above, if the queue never empties (because SLAs) then step 4 will never kick in, and we'll never reload the queue. Step 3 will ensure that within a short interval any deleted dags are removed from the queue (should they happen to be one of the ones generating SLAs) but updated and newly added dag files will not be picked up.\r\n    - To be clear, this is the problem I alluded to in my comments at the end of the previous PR after it got merged.\r\n\r\n# What this PR changes\r\n\r\nThe fix is extremely simple - although the SLA callback is registered with the manager, simply getting an SLA callback no longer causes the dag to be added to the queue. This ensures that the queue will periodically empty, and thus all existing dag files will be re-added on a regular basis. If you update a dag file, the change will be picked up within `min_file_process_interval`.\r\n\r\nThe trade-off is that the SLA callback will not be processed until its dag file is processed as part of the periodic reload of all dag files onto the queue.\r\n\r\nI have also added some comments and some extra metrics which I find useful, but the only functional change is the one above.\r\n\r\n# Seems familiar?\r\n\r\nI actually tried to make a change in this area last year (see #25489 / #27317). The change in that PR was a lot more involved as it tried to close several possible edge cases. While I was confident in that change (I have been running it in prod for months using a locally patched copy), I can understand the need for caution.\r\n\r\nThis change is less invasive. If you don't use SLA's there's no impact. If you _do_ use SLAs and sometimes find the system doesn't pick up changes to your dags ... well, this fixes that.\r\n\r\n# Loose ends\r\n\r\nThe previous PR was more invasive, but closed a few additional edge cases:\r\n1. Large numbers of non-SLA callbacks having the same effect and DoS'ing the queue:  \r\nIn my locally patched copy, this _never_ happens. Maybe other people will have different experiences in the wild, but (by virtue of having the additional queue metrics) I was able to see that the numbers were never anything like as big as the SLA callbacks\r\n2. Increased time to SLA alert:  \r\nYes, this does mean that a SLA callback will not be picked up immediately - you'll have to wait until all the dag files have been processed and the queue is refreshed; this will either be `min_file_process_interval` or the time needed to process all your dag files, whichever is longer. But by default `min_file_process_interval` is 30 seconds, which is still pretty quick.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with the above trade-offs, given that this change is so small vs the impact it has (finally fixes SLAs!)","created_at":"2023-03-13T17:33:17Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T08:27:01Z","closed_at":"2023-03-16T21:51:24Z","merged_at":"2023-03-16T21:51:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"53ed5620a45d454ab95df886a713a5e28933f8c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

we are generating constraints including released version of providers or \"no providers\" (which effectively means preinstalled version of providers only), we should use non-editable installation of airflow.\r\n\r\nNormally in CI, we have editable version of airflow and we install providers from sources, but this leads to skipping installation of the preinstalled providers (it is connected to the fact that we were earlier installing as editable and \"sources only\" and those packages are marked as required, which confuses newer version of pip. It prints that the preinstalled packages are installed, but it does not specify the version - apparently thinking the editable version of the install already contains them.\r\n\r\nSince our behaviour is pretty non-standard, this is not really a bug in pip, but it is a bug in our approach when we are adding providers for constraint generation. Rather than using editable installation when we add providers, we should use \"regular\" installation. This seems to remove the confusion and the preinstalled packages are also installed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

#8019\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe K8S client verifies the server’s SSL certificate by default, using the system’s trusted CA certificates. If we use a self-signed certificate, the only solution we have now is disabling SSL verification by setting the `verify_ssl` parameter to `False`. However, this is not recommended for production environments.\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new Airflow conf `ssl_ca_cert`, which is a path to the certificate file we want to use in the API client to verify

purpose of this PR is to add the foundations required to convert AMPP operators to deferrable operators. \r\nThe [aiobotocore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore) library is being used to make all async calls to the boto3 API.\r\n\r\nRather than create separate Async hooks for every service, we create an `async_conn` property in `base_aws.py` which behaves similar to the existing `conn` property. This property allows us to get access to a client that can make async boto3 API calls. This also allows us to make use of the supporting code that exists for the `conn` property. The `get_client_type` function is extended to handle returning a `ClientCreatorContext` object which can be used to get a client that supports asynchronous calls. \r\n\r\nAnother addition this PR makes is extending `get_waiter` in `base_aws.py` to work with custom async waiters. Currently, the `get_waiter` function allows us to create a custom waiter using a JSON config file. This PR allows passing a `client` parameter which can be used to return an async waiter generated by the `aiobotocore` library. This feature will save a lot of code duplication by standardizing the polling portion of Triggers. A README.md file is included that describes how Triggers can be written which make use of these features. Although not all operators and sensor will be able to make use of these features, there are many in the AMPP that can be written in a standardized format following the methods described. \r\n\r\nThe `RedshiftCreateClusterOperator` is chosen to demonstrate how an operator would be modified to become a deferrable operator. We use the built-in `cluster_available` waiter in the Trigger to asynchronously poll the boto3 API to wait for the cluster to become available. \r\n@Taragolis, @uranusjr , @potiuk , @pankajastro I'd love to hear your thoughts on this approach, and see what you think.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

to Workday Example in Customizing DAG Scheduling with Timetables**\r\n\r\nThe existing workday example provided a good demonstration of customizing DAG scheduling with timetables. However the benefits were somewhat limited over using a CRON string.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a more robust example for Airflow users by adding a holiday filter to the existing weekend exclusions. The primary benefits of this change are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. It provides a solution to a common use case for Airflow users that cannot be approximated with CRON.\r\n2. It separates out the logic of determining whether to schedule on a given day from the common logic used by Airflow to request what the next scheduled date/time should be.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-10T18:49:14Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T21:28:48Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T22:56:19Z","merged_at":"2023-03-15T22:56:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"66b5f90f4536329ba1fe0e54e3f15ec98c1e2730","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3508325829,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK287RHM3F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:doc-only","name":"type:doc-only","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

For example, [BigQueryCheckOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L200) uses the [deferrable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L200) parameter to toggle deferred execution while we need to use another sensor for [GCSObjectExistenceSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/gcs.py#L39) (i.e., [GCSObjectExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/gcs.py#L103)) to achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\n### What's changed?\r\nIn this pull request, I move the deferred logic from [GCSObjectExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/gcs.py#L103) to [GCSObjectExistenceSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/gcs.py#L39) so that we can keep the consistency and reduce maintenance effort. Instead of removing [GCSObjectExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/gcs.py#L103), I add a deprecation warning in case there're users using it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)**

you want to upgrade a set of dependencies (for example all google packages) you might deal with a set of dependencies that are conflicting or difficult to upgrade all-at-once. And there might be multiple people working on it in parallel. This brings in the necessity of building the CI image of breeze with a different set of constraints than the ones in \"main\" branch of Airflow and share it with others working with you.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the capability of storing a temporary set of constraints in the repository (during PR iteration) and use this constraint file to build the CI image, rather than constraints from the repository. It also provides appropriate README.md file explaining how to iterate and regenerate such constraint files - even multiple times when iterating.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
