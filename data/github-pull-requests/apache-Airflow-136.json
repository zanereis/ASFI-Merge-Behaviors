we are constructing cross-provider dependencies, we should adjust\r\nthe limits to account for some apache-airflow packages that are not yet\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment is to add \".*\" after the version number when\r\ndependency is lower-bound with `>=`. It's not explicitly mentioned in\r\nPEP 440 - it is only mentioned there that it works for\r\nequality, but since `>=` is also part of `equal` it also\r\nworks there.\r\n\r\nExample is a common-sql package that might be limited to `>=1.1.0`\r\nin google provider as part of the change, but it might not yet be released\r\nas it is being released together with the package it is needed by.\r\n\r\nWe  need to adjust the version whenever in our providers we\r\nrefer to other providers with >= install clause because  `--pre`\r\nflag in `pip` only allows to install direct pre-release (and\r\ndevelopment) dependencies but it does not modify requirements of\r\nthose package to also include pre-releases as transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to remove the limits in `devel` dependencies because\r\nthe packages are not yet released at the moment we use those\r\ndependencies, so the limits in `devel` should be removed, allowing\r\nthe developers to install Airflow without those devel packages.\r\n\r\nAlso a bug was found that would prevent to generate\r\nthe dependencies in case provider.yaml file only changed (bad\r\nspecification of .pre-commit include)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#25241\r\n\r\nThere was nearly no performance impact on /grid_data when using 25 runs of 2k tasks split across 100 task groups. Response size increased a little bit (more data after all), but overall additional time was 50ms extra on a 4s request. This will also allow us to remove our use of /tasks, which is much slower than the extra time added (and, a much smaller payload difference too). Overall, once we remove the use of /tasks, much less data will flow to the browser and less webserver time will be taken too.","created_at":"2022-07-26T23:13:14Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T11:24:37Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T10:34:06Z","merged_at":"2022-07-28T10:34:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2df9fe7860d1e795040e40723828c192aca68be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

we are constructing devel-all, we should strip the limits\r\nto account for some shared packages that are not yet released.\r\n\r\nExample is a common-sql package that might be limited to >1.1.0\r\nfor example as part of the change, but it might not yet be released.\r\n\r\nIt does not impact our CI, because we are anyhow removing the packages\r\nafter installing (we only care about dependencies of their) and we\r\nare using source version of providers - but having a limit coming\r\nfrom another provider will make `pip` resolver fail if we do not\r\nstrip the limits.\r\n\r\nWe also need to add .a0 as suffix whenever in our providers we refer\r\nto other providers with >= install clause because of a bug in\r\n`pip` that does not take into account pre-release version when\r\nperforming >= comparision, thus disallowing to release a package\r\nthat depends on new version of another package together.\r\n\r\nWe need to add >= X.Y.Za0 in case we release pre-release version to\r\nfix the problem. Also a bug was found that would prevent to generate\r\nthe dependencies in case provider.yaml file only changed (bad\r\nspecification of .pre-commit include)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

providers deriving from DbApi had some variations in some\r\nmethods that were derived from the common DbApi Hook. Mostly they\r\nwere about extra parameters added and hql parameter used instead of\r\nsql. This prevents from really \"common\" approach in DbApiHook as\r\nsome common sql operators rely on signatures being the same.\r\n\r\nThis introduced breaking changes in a few providers - but those\r\nbreaking changes are easy to fix and most have already been\r\ndeprecated.\r\n\r\nI also had to make sure all types are correct (hence cloud_sql typing fixes).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

mimics the import system's behavior -- package of a name in front of `sys.path` \"shadows\" the one in the back, and should avoid a package from being loaded multiple times, if its containing directory appears multiple times in `sys.path`.\r\n\r\nThis also causes a side effect: if there are **different** plugins of the same name, previously the one later in `sys.path` would have been discovered, but now it wouldn't. I think this is a reasonable compromise, since loading multiple packages of one same name is never a good idea in\r\nPython in the first place, and we should have been careful to preclude the possibility to begin with.\r\n\r\nShould fix #25271. cc @rino0601

legacy Airflow SqlSensor, rejects working wiht comon.sql providers\r\neve if they are perfectly fine to use.\r\n\r\nWhile users could switch to the common.sql sensor (and it\r\nshould work fine). we should not force the users to switch to it.\r\n\r\nWe are implementing \"fake\" class hierarchy in case the provider\r\nis installed on Airflow 2.3 and below.\r\n\r\nIn case of Airflow 2.4+ importing the old DbApiHook will fail,\r\nbecause it will cause a circular import - in such case our\r\nnew DbApiHook will derive (as it was originally planned) from\r\nBaseHook.\r\n\r\nBut In case of Airflow 2.3 and below such import will succeed\r\nand we are using the original DbApiHook from airflow.hooks.dbapi\r\nas base class - this way any \"common.sql\" hook on Airflow 2.3\r\nand below will also derive from the airlfow.hooks.dbapi.DbApiHook\r\n- thus it will be possible to use it by the original SqlSensor.\r\n\r\nFixes: #25274\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI was trying to decipher when exactly a DAG run associated with a given `ds` would run, i.e., at midnight (00:00) or midnight (24:00). Per the docs, \r\n\r\n> A DAG run is usually scheduled after its associated data interval has ended, to ensure the run is able to collect all the data within the time period. In other words, a run covering the data period of 2020-01-01 generally does not start to run until 2020-01-01 has ended, i.e. after 2020-01-02 00:00:00.\r\n\r\nand observing DAG runs it seems like these DAG runs occur at the end of said day rather than the beginning. \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the documentationâhopefully I got this correctâto:\r\n\r\n1. Remove confusion. As reported in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Confusion_at_noon_and_midnight) Wikipedia article there's some ambiguity around what day midnight is associated with and thus I felt being explicitâvia the use of a 24 hour clockâwould help clarify.\r\n2. Address inaccuracies/inconsistencies, i.e., some DAG presets state \"midnight\" whereas others reference the morningâ \"midnight on Sunday morning\". Additionally I think \"... at the _beginning_ of the hour\" should be \"... at the _end_ of the hour\" assuming these windows operate in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

environment can be easily customized by specifying your own\r\ninit.sh file in files/airflow-breeze-config/init.sh. However, there\r\nare certain scenarios (for example GitHub Codespaces), where you cannot\r\ndo that, but you can easily specify an environment variable to set\r\nwhen you enter Breeze container - and you need to customize your\r\nenvironment there, becasue you need to make your airflow code\r\nre-linked from Github default \"/workspace/airflow\" to \"/opt/airflow\").\r\n\r\nIn such case it is much more convenient to provide the command to run\r\nvia environment variable and eval the command at entering the image.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements such a possibility.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

on the discussion on #24728, this is the PR to allow the users to add their own hyperlinks to the `owner` property.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this PR is as follows - \r\nSimilar to what we do with DAG tags, I've created a separate table in the DB to store the links with the following schema:`dag_id :: owner_name :: owner_link`. \r\n Before I reached this implementation, I tried saving the dict in the current `owners` column, but I faced challenges and was convinced that it was not the right way of implementation. The tradeoffs, as I see them are:\r\n1. The current `owners` field is a property of a DAG that contains all of them. This is a string column. To add the new implementation there, I had to save as strings the following object: `{owner1: link1}, {owner2:link2}`. This is not native to work with, as it's a list of dicts inside a string column. Also, delimiter problems are also occurring here, and if we change the delimiter of the `owners` field (`,` -> `;` for example), it breaks a lot of the current flow.\r\n2.  Link length - The links (especially `mailto` links that can contain a message template) can be long. The current `owners` column length is `2000`, and in DAGs with multiple owners, it can be a problem. By moving this logic to its own table, we can manage the link length independently. \r\n3. Separation of concerns - Only the `views.py` file and the `DagModel` (for the orm bulk write) needs to be aware of owner links, all the other components can keep getting their `owners` field in the same way they are used to :) \r\n\r\nAlso, something I tried was to have the new `owner_link` dictionary as a task attribute, but it was tricky to fail when we had duplicates of the same owner name with different links (see [comment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/25280#issuecomment-1204976965))\r\n\r\nEventually, this PR suggest the following new flow:\r\n1. Having another attribute called `owner_links` to be added to the DAG object\r\n2. Validating the input (no exploits, correct format, etc...) and presenting `Broken DAG` if something is bad.\r\n3. Saving the `DAG.owner_links` to the new db table `dag_owner_attributes`\r\n4. in `views.py`, collecting the dag_owners to an object that will be passed to `dags.html`\r\n5. in `dags.html`, check if the owner has a link, if so, pass it to the `href=` clause, and if not keep the current behaviour. \r\n\r\nThis PR was tested on the following flows manually using local Airflow started by `breeze`:\r\n1. Using multiple DBs to verify the schema migration (SQLite, Postgres), started by `--backend` param to `breeze`.\r\n6. Verified that the new table is getting records added, edited, and deleted based on live DAG edits.\r\n7. Verified that in the DAGs view page, owners with valid links are transferred into a hyperlink and opened in a new tab for quality of life :) \r\n8. Bad formatting of URLs, and potential exploits (calling hyperlink with `javascript:alert(1)` for example), are not getting loaded into the system and thrown out with `AirflowException`.\r\n9. Added `Owner Links` property to `Dag Details` page that shows the owner links,  and `None` if no links existing in the DAG.\r\n\r\nThe DAGs I've used to test it (set in the local `files/dags/` folder):\r\n1. dag_with_owner_links.py\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\n\r\ndefault_args =

PR attempts to fix the deadlock that occurs when task instance\r\nis being run in parallel to running _do_scheduling operation\r\nexecuting get_next_dagruns_to_examine.\r\n\r\nThe whole scheduling is based on actually locking DagRuns scheduler\r\noperats on - and it basically means that state of ANY task instances\r\nfor that DagRun should not change during the scheduling.\r\n\r\nHowever there are some cases where task instance is locked\r\nFOR UPDATE without prior locking of the DagRun table - this\r\nhappens for example when local task job executes the task\r\nand runs \"check_and_change_state_before_execution\" method on the\r\ntask instance it runs. There is no earlier DagRun locking\r\nhappening and the \"refresh_from_db\" run with lock_for_update\r\nwill get the lock on both TaskInstance row as well as on the\r\nDagRun row. The problem is this locking happens in reverse sequence\r\nin this case:\r\n\r\n1) get_next_dagruns_to_examine - locks DagRun first and THEN\r\n   tries to locks some task instances for that DagRun\r\n\r\n2) \"check_and_change_state_before_execution\" runs effectively the\r\n    query: select ... from task_instance join dag_run ... for update\r\n    which FIRST locks TaskInstance and then DagRun table.\r\n\r\nThis reverse sequence of locking is what causes the deadlock.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to force locking the DagRun before running the task instance\r\nquery that joins dag_run to task_instance.\r\n\r\nFixes: #23361\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

If the log file is moved or deleted, a new one will be created and the stdout/stderr will be written into it, but not from the start of the file. Instead if the original log file was x characters long, the new log file will contain x null bytes, and the new lines will be appended after that. To fix this problem we need to open the file with an access mode that has the `O_APPEND` flag enabled.\r\n\r\nShort list of access modes and flags:\r\n\r\n| fopen() mode | open() flags |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| w+ | O_RDWR \\| O_CREAT \\| O_TRUNC |\r\n| w | O_WRONLY \\| O_CREAT \\| O_TRUNC |\r\n| a | O_WRONLY \\| O_CREAT \\| O_APPEND |\r\n| a+ | O_RDWR \\| O_CREAT \\| O_APPEND |\r\n\r\nBased on this I propose changing the access mode for these output files from `w+` to `a`. I don't think there's any need to have read access so `+` can be dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this solution is that the `a` mode does not have the `O_TRUNC` flag enabled, which means that the output file is not truncated when a component is restarted. To preserve this behaviour we can manually truncate the files with `handler.truncate(0)`. We could also set the flags manually for the handlers but I don't think that it will make the solution more readable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

to make codespaces work.\r\n\r\nI faced 2 issues with that, fixed by the first 2 commits respectively.\r\n\r\nThe issue with `local.yml` compose file was that it kept failing the build because of the mount source paths, if they don't exist on the host `Error response from daemon: invalid mount config for type \"bind\": bind source path does not exist`.\r\n\r\nI did some troubleshooting and the only thing I could come up with is that the docker-compose version is not the culprit here. I used the bootstrap image that codspaces use and were able to successfully bind mount non-existing dirs, so it could be something with the node app they use to get everything up and running? \r\n\r\nSide inquiry, I was initially confused as to what's the actual purpose for spinning up a codespace instance. Is it so we could mainly have testing env similar to CI and do only breeze tasks after you have done some changes somewhere else? or is it supposed to be a complete development env (similar to local on your machine) so you can create local virtual environmensts and launch different breeze configs? This question comes up after I realized that in the codespace instance you'd have:\r\n- `/opt/airflow` containing only the needed mounts from `local.yml`, with no `.git` dir.\r\n-

outlets field could be used for more things than datasets.  So we can't know how to reliably serialize all the objects that might end up there.  So we just serialize the datasets (which is all we care about for the moment) and expose them under an attribute `outlet_datasets`.\r\n\r\n@bbovenzi note that we don't have the dataset ID here.  It's not stored in the serialized dag data for simplicity reasons.  We'd have to query the DB at serialization time to retrieve the ID, so we could do it, just don't need it yet.  And, since you are just using this to check if a task has dataset outlets, this should do fine for you.  You should be able to simply check that `outlet_datasets` is nonempty.","created_at":"2022-07-23T03:33:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-28T15:55:47Z","closed_at":"2022-07-28T15:55:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72ab148c705cbb35e9b09442158ae5a214b66cc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's REST/HTTP API"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

begun using a script to help us sift through all the month's PRs, as part of the voting process for the PR of the Month in the newsletter.\r\n\r\nThis alters the script in a few ways:\r\n\r\n* Adds `--load` and `--save` flags that serialize/unserialize the PR data retrieved from GitHub. This allows for quicker iteration on the scoring heuristics - you can re-run it with the same data and it will generate new scores.\r\n\r\n* Captures additional metrics on the body length of the PR, the total length of all the PR comments, and the number of additions/deletions. I reviewed all of the PRs in this month's date range and noticed that the PRs I found most interesting had *lengthy* descriptions and comments.\r\n\r\n* Splits out metrics that were previously used in scoring functions but not persisted (like num_reviewers) into separate properties so they can be `--save`d.\r\n\r\n* Adjusts the heuristics to incorporate new metrics & adjust weighting. These are better, I think, but certainly not optimized. We should be tweaking them over time.\r\n\r\n* Adds some more verbose output, i.e.: \r\n<img width=\"1141\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 1 35 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1434475/180493932-7586ea07-ead4-41a4-895e-c5c762a0539b.png\">\r\n\r\nThis also contributes a notebook that I used to inspect the contents of the `--save` file and export it to CSV. Sometimes a pivot table is just the tool we need; this makes it easy to create one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR fixes an issue introduced by https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/b7c3c9657a6737a06afcb907e55f95a98d51a56c (authored by @kazanzhy) which added iterating over ExaStatement when using `ExasolHook.run()`.\r\nIteration can only be done for statements with a `result_type=resultSet`, for other result types, pyexasol raises `ExaRuntimeError(self.connection, 'Attempt to fetch from statement without result set')`. This happens for all `create` and `drop` statements (their result type is `rowCount`).\r\nTherefore, an extra check is needed before the iteration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

examing our use of the statsd_exporter in airflow, we found a couple\r\nissues. We couldn't easily override the fork of the exporter image,\r\nbecuase it requires pushing statsd.extraMappings. We also found that the\r\nexporter produces huge metric names (over 250 chars long) due to metrics\r\nthat are not matched in the mappings config.\r\n\r\n* Always use the ConfigMap. This allows for easier use of the official\r\n  upstream Prometheus container image.\r\n* Upgrade the statsd-exporter to the latest release.\r\n* Update exporter config to use the new defaults section.\r\n* Add a \"drop unknown mappings\" to reduce metrics spam.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: SuperQ <superq@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull
