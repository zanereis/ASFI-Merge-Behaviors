SUMMARY\r\nImplements the new alerts and reports processing on the celery workers. PR number 3, previous related PR's #11606 #11550 \r\n\r\nThis is a rework heavily based on the existing alerts implementation, maintains the current logic with the following differences:\r\n\r\n- Celery beat scheduling, was simplified and does not try to schedule possible lost events from the past, the schedule window is framed present to future.\r\n- Only one beat config is needed for alerts and reports, should be configured with the lowest time grain possible for cron, aka 1 minute.\r\n- Implements a log prune task, this should be configured on a separate celery beat (e.g. 1 day).\r\n- Notifications currently support Email and Slack but it's easy to extend to other platforms.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-16T12:09:18Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:22:00Z","closed_at":"2020-11-25T08:50:31Z","merged_at":"2020-11-25T08:50:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f27ebc4be5932ee9733a7635390eabdf4452f67a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1332384320,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMyMzg0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"5A30DA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578354367,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBm4vw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%201.0.0","name":"üö¢

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nVarious control sections have been showing up under unexpected tabs. This PR makes it simpler/easier to shove control sections under the correct tab, by allowing \"tabOverride\" to be either \"data\" or \"customize\" and simplifying (essentially inverting) the logic that takes place when neither is specified. This also removes support for putting the \"tabOverride\" in a singular control, and just keeps it to the control section, for simplicity.\r\n\r\nI have half a mind to just make it \"tab\" instead of \"tabOverride\" and bake it into every control section, as a standard practice... but I'll pocket that one, as a control layout refactor will likely be coming soon (reconsidering the current rows/columns approach). But that's another story, and probably another PR...\r\n\r\nAlso, there will be a PR over on `superset-ui` that utilizes this new \"customize\" value in numerous places. We can merge that one before this one, I think, and I'll bump all the chart versions as part of this PR when it exits draft mode.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\nPrevent passing potentially unsafe modules/methods to the Jinja template context:\r\n- Removes default exposed modules such as `datetime` and `timedelta`\r\n- Proxies exposed methods such as `current_user_id` and `url_param` through a method that enforces static return values\r\n\r\nThere are no changes to Jijna templating syntax with this update, other than the default modules (such as `datetime`) are no longer available by default.\r\n\r\nAdding custom Jinja context items is still possible via `JINJA_CONTEXT_ADDONS` as is overriding the template processor on a per-database engine basis via `CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_PROCESSORS`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context/discussion in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11617\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- [x] Write tests\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- Test Jinja templating in SQL Lab and in virtual datasets\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe corners of the default card/dash images had pre-rendered rounded corners, that looked goofy at certain scales. They were also PNG, so they got a little blurry at times.\r\n\r\nNow they're SVG, with square corners, cropped by their containers' border-radius, so we should be sharp all the way around!\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduced 3 new commands:\r\n\r\n- `superset.commands.importers.v1.ImportModelsCommand`: a base class used for the v1 importers for databases, datasets (in this PR), dashboard, charts and saved queries (in future PRs). The base class validates the import bundle, checking that the `metadata.yaml` file that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nversion: 1.0.0\r\ntype: Database\r\ntimestamp: '2020-11-04T21:27:44.423819+00:00'\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `run` on the class will start a database transaction block, calling the `import_bundle` method of each subclass. If there are any errors all imports are rolled back, preventing partial imports.\r\n\r\n- `superset.databases.commands.importers.v1.ImportDatabasesCommand`: a command that imports one or more databases present in the import bundle, as well as associated datasets. Because of this, in addition to validating databases present in the bundle, the command will also validate the datasets.\r\n\r\n**When importing a database, associated datasets are imported non-destructively**: if a table `foo` currently has a column `col`, but the imported dataset doesn't have it the column **will not be deleted**.\r\n\r\n- `superset.datasets.commands.importers.v1.ImportDatasetsCommand`: a command that imports one or more datasets present in the import bundle, as well as associated databases. Similar to the previous command, it will validate the database configuration as well.\r\n\r\nWhen importing a dataset we **sync** columns and metrics one way (from bundle to DB). This means that when importing an existing dataset all missing columns and metrics in the import bundle are removed. This behavior is similar to the current datasource CLI import in Superset when passing the `--sync` flag.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI found myself using the \"edit\" link for charts, and being bummed that it was the metadata modal, not the Explore view... so I added the icon/link for explore view in card and list views! This wasn't part of the original design, so I want to make sure that folks are cool with it!\r\n\r\n**EDIT** By popular demand (ok, two people mentioned it) I removed the Edit link that pops the chart modal.

SUMMARY\r\nWe found an issue when user tried to change default filter value for a dashboard:\r\n1. from dashboard list, user open a dashboard. current dashboard url contains default filters in the url: for example: \r\nhttp://localhost:8080/superset/dashboard/67/?preselect_filters=%7B\"1086\"%3A%20%7B\"region\"%3A%20\"\"%7D%2C%20\"1101\"%3A%20%7B\"__time_range\"%3A%20\"2014-01-01%20%3A%202014-01-02\"%7D%7D\r\n1. user can change dashboard filters, or make change in Dashboard Properties, and save dashboard. Then user will assume dashboard default filters are changed and saved.\r\n1. Then they want see the new default filters. If they just reload dashboard, because dashboard is loaded with `preselect_filters` in the url, dashboard's metadata is overwritten by old request parameter. So users can not see the new change.\r\n\r\nWe added \"preselect_filters\" in the dashboard url long time ago, at that time we didn't load and parse all dashboard metadata. Right now we got same information from dashboard metadata, I think we don't need to append in the dashboard url, because the old state in the url will cause problem after dashboard is updated.\r\n\r\nWe will still keep the functionality that parse \"preselect_filters\" in dashboard, and url parameter can overwrite dashboard metadata. If users want to dynamic generate dashboard link with preselect_filters, this behavior won't be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-12T00:31:27Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:21:34Z","closed_at":"2020-11-12T21:00:28Z","merged_at":"2020-11-12T21:00:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"0338b48fddc88feadce5f4c9222ad62a8656f275","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578354367,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBm4vw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%201.0.0","name":"üö¢

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBetter database connection validation when creating a database. Discovered this bug while developing #11509 , the symptom of the failed test on the user side is you can add databases with wrong passwords as long as `TABLE_NAMES_CACHE_CONFIG` is enabled. The cause is that [Database.get_all_schema_names](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/edb9619731658151ed864321ede06980d767501d/superset/models/core.py#L547) is a cached function with `self.id` as cache key, but a newly created uncommitted Database instance always has `self.id == None`.\r\n\r\nAlso renames a couple of test databases to make it easier to debug in case some of them slip through failed tests and got incorrectly created.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug with unit tests:\r\n\r\n1. Add `TABLE_NAMES_CACHE_CONFIG` in test config. E.g.\r\n   ```\r\n   TABLE_NAMES_CACHE_CONFIG = {\r\n     **CACHE_CONFIG,\r\n     \"CACHE_KEY_PREFIX\": \"superset_data_cache\",\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n2. Run test case\r\n    ```\r\n    pytest tests/databases/api_tests.py::TestDatabaseApi::test_create_database_conn_fail\r\n    ```\r\n    multiple times\r\n3. You test will fail with `AssertionError: 201 != 422`\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the bug in user interface:\r\n\r\n1. Enable `TABLE_NAMES_CACHE_CONFIG`\r\n2. Try adding a database with wrong password multiple times.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCleanup/override static assets only when running `npm run build` or `npm run dev`, not when in `npm run dev-server`. This allows developers to compare the current version of Superset with what they are working on without switching back and forth between branches.\r\n\r\nA typical workflow would be:\r\n\r\nFirst, run production build and start the Flask server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run build\r\nsuperset run -p 8088\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen start the dev server in another window:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm run dev-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can visit `http://localhost:8088` for the production version, and `http://localhost:9000` for the dev version. Any local changes you made wouldn't affect the production version, meaning you will always have a production version to refer to when you are actively developing something.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nManual. Follow the workflow above and make sure both debug servers work.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user edited a chart title through Edit properties modal, the title of the chart didn't update, even though it was correctly saved.\r\nWhen user edits chart properties on Explore view, the changes are saved locally, but there is no request to API until the user clicks \"Save\" button. Modals on other views (ChartList and ChartTable) work as before.\r\nOn the gif you can see that no request is being made when editing chart title on Explore view until \"save\" button is

the thumbnail image covering the cards' borders. This meant that images with white or gray backgrounds would look very odd. This PR makes some tweaks to allow the border to show at all times, and also adds the 1px horizontal rule between the thumbnail area and the footer, as per the original design.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nFixes issues described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11609 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11601.\r\nI fixed the overflowing calendar issue by overriding tabs overflow styles in the popover. I don't think it's a perfect solution, because if the content of the tab changes to something that would actually require overflow, we'll need to do some workarounds.\r\nI tried to render the calendar in a Portal (using `renderView` prop), outside of nodes with `overflow: hidden`, but react-datetime doesn't work well with portals - the calendar view relies on its parent's css class, so we can't mount it in a different place.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issues\r\nAfter:\r\n![ezgif com-gif-maker

SUMMARY\r\n[chevron](https://github.com/noahmorrison/chevron) is a python implementation of mustache.js, and seems much safer by scope (project tagline is \"Logic-less templates\" !) than `jinja2` could ever be.\r\n\r\nWhile the library is not super active lately, it appears to be feature complete and is easy to review from a security standpoint as it's a few short-ish modules. Overall the whole library is <1k lines.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the chevron library behind a feature flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n### SHORTCOMINGS\r\n- one shortcoming is the html escaping that we have to work around using triple curlies ie:`{{{ ... }}}`. I submitted a PR to enable turning this off in our context here https://github.com/noahmorrison/chevron/pull/81\r\n- accessing a position in an array seems impossible in the release using the undocumented `{{mylist.0}}` mustache feature, but works in chevron's `master`, highlighting the fact that the lib hasn't released to PyPI in a long time\r\n- given the security risks here, we should do a full audit of chevron's [small] codebase, and pin the lib. Bumping the lib should force a deep analysis of the changelog/changeset to make sure there are no security regressions\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"427\"

SUMMARY\r\nIn #11220 and #11305, we introduced a feature that prevent mid-air collision when 2 users editing same dashboard. There are some users in airbnb reported that when only 1 user editing dashboard a couple of times they will see the warning message, even there is no co-editing happens, see issue #11477\r\n\r\nWhen i debug this issue, i found when error happens, it shows client-side last_updated_time and dashboard's changed_on has a very subtle mis-match, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nremote:1604869261.688\r\nchanged_on:1604869262.0\r\n```\r\nit seems dashboards table's changed_on is rounded-up to second level, while client-side last_update_time is not. \r\nSo i will add a round function in client-side and try to make this number match in the second level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe intent is to add all committers / PMC as admin on the Google Analytics console, and to publish periodic reports to the community.\r\n\r\nIt's important for the community to monitor it's health and traffic on `superset.apache.org` is a good proxy for this, and important data points that can inform decisions to help grow the community.\r\n\r\nI know the Apache Airflow community uses Google Analytics in a similar fashion, so I figure it's reasonable to do this.","created_at":"2020-11-07T18:41:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:21:11Z","closed_at":"2020-11-12T21:57:06Z","merged_at":"2020-11-12T21:57:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"5cb6c25ca0aef4de88cc8def9c756a1932403232","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578354367,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBm4vw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%201.0.0","name":"üö¢

SUMMARY\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11598 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11608. The issue was that when you opened a popover, **didn't make any changes** and then clicked save, 'isNew' prop wasn't set to false before sending it to `onChange` function. Then the component rerendered and `isNew` was still set to true and popover reopened.\r\nCC: @junlincc \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![ezgif

SUMMARY\r\nFixes issues described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11546.\r\nThere was also another bug - select menu wasn't fully visible when it overflew the popover (which is almost always) - see the first gif.\r\nThe filters popover was jumpy and it was related to `handleMultiComparatorInputHeightChange` function in `AdhocFilterEditPopoverSimpleTabContent.jsx` file. I removed it, however if it was actually necessary for something I'd appreciate a feedback (@ktmud the last changes to that function was done by you - can you take a look?). \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nMinor refinements to Row Level Security (RLS) implementation:\r\n- Move `ENABLE_ROW_LEVEL_SECURITY` from config flag to feature flag.\r\n- Remove RLS from table view related view. Currently non-admin users can see all RLS filters that apply to a table, which can be both a security concern and a privacy issue.\r\n- Disable `Row Level Security` and `Row Level Security Filters` view menus for other users than `Admin`.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA couple of small styling fixes for the dashboard page.\r\n\r\n1. Change tabs back to regular case: in general, user inputs should not be uppercase because if users really want to use uppercase, they can easily do that themself. Leaving uppercase labels to native UI elements also makes them more special and utility-like.\r\n2. Adjust the margins in filter labels. Currently the text is kind of all over the place. \r\n3. Change the cursor for dashboard tabs in editing state from pointer (indicating a button) to text (indicating this is an input field).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis is more of a patch fix.\r\n\r\nThe true underlying problem is a bad state design for the \"switching between tabs\" state but I don't have the bandwidth to address that right now.\r\n\r\nThe reason this fix works/is necessary is that `gridComponents/Chart`'s `shouldComponentUpdate` function uses `mountedTab === null` state to check whether the chart should render. This is a bad way to represent that state, hence this bug. But it is what it is.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes
