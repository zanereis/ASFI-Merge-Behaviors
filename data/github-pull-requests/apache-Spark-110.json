Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis enhances Storage Partitioned Join by handling mismatch partition keys from both sides of the join and skip shuffle in certain cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently in Storage Partitioned Join, when the partition transform expressions match, but the partition keys don't, we'd still fallback to shuffle. This is not necessary since we can find out the common set of partition keys and populate that to the scan nodes. On the scan node, those missing partition keys can be filled with empty partitions. \r\n\r\nThe above scenario is pretty common for `MERGE INTO` queries, as the changing data to be merged into the base table often need to be applied to new partitions. The current implementation will cause these queries to trigger shuffle and thus become expensive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a few new tests in `KeyGroupedPartitioningSuite`.","created_at":"2022-12-07T01:42:01Z","updated_at":"2022-12-24T20:57:06Z","closed_at":"2022-12-22T19:57:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"656ffd9ba7137b577d285672b9cabb098cbc6a21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/478628b3bef6dcc481b7aa2ccf96617bc8eeb95d","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-41413","ref":"SPARK-41413","sha":"478628b3bef6dcc481b7aa2ccf96617bc8eeb95d","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is follow-up to commit cc55de33420335bd715720e1d9190bd5e8e2e9fc where `PVC_COUNTER` was introduced to track outstanding number of PVCs.\r\n`PVC_COUNTER` should only be decremented when the pod deletion happens (in response to error).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf the PVC isn't created successfully (where `PVC_COUNTER` isn't incremented) (possibly due to execution not reaching `resource(pvc).create()` call), we shouldn't decrement the counter.\r\n\r\n`success` tracks the progress of PVC creation:\r\nvalue 0 means PVC is not created.\r\nvalue 1 means PVC has been created.\r\nvalue 2 means PVC has been created but due to subsequent error, the pod is deleted.\r\n\r\nThe counter is decremented when either `KUBERNETES_DRIVER_OWN_PVC` or `KUBERNETES_DRIVER_REUSE_PVC` has false value since the PVC is not owned by Driver pod.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-12-07T00:48:40Z","updated_at":"2023-03-19T00:21:53Z","closed_at":"2023-03-19T00:21:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1eda72ecfc5d5f43f52451ba8b44c1a0a5f80e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/52c4e57571c33e0be16b01a8e85169f58bfbebd2","head":{"label":"tedyu:pvc-cnt","ref":"pvc-cnt","sha":"52c4e57571c33e0be16b01a8e85169f58bfbebd2","user":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325822007,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU4MjIwMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"tedyu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tedyu","id":235188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu","html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tedyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tedyu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe split the current `connector/connect` project into two projects:\r\n- `connector/connect/common`: this contains the proto definitions, and build targets for proto buf related code generation. In the future this can also contain utilities that are shared between the server and the client.\r\n- `connector/connect/server`: this contains the code for the connect server and plugin (all the current scala code). This includes the dsl because it is used for server related tests. In the future we might replace the DSL by the scala client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn preparation for the Spark Connect Scala Client we need to split the server and the proto files. This, together with another refactoring in Catalyst, will allow us to create a client with a minimal set of dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `PVC-oriented executor pod allocation` which means Spark driver will create a fixed number of PVCs (= `spark.executor.instances` or `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`) and hold on new executor pod creations if the number of created PVCs reached the limit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will allow Spark to hand over the existing PVCs from dead executors to new executors.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor v2 DML commands, the input query is a child plan and will be optimized by the optimizer. In the execution path, if the v2 table supports v1 fallback, we will create a DataFrame from the optimized input query plan, and pass the DataFrame to v1 write API.\r\n\r\nThis means that the input query gets optimized twice: once during the DML command planning, once with the extra DataFrame creation. This is a waste of optimizing time and can cause issues if some custom optimizer rules are not idempotent.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new field `analyzedQuery: Option[LogicalPlan]` to the v2 commands that support v1 fallback. This field will be filled at the end of analysis and will be used to create that v1 fallback DataFrame.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid double optimizing the input query plan of v2 DML commands\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPropagate the `metadataOutput` through the `Union` operator. Propagate only when the `metadataOutput` in all children matches structurally by data type and name. This is done as the metadata is transparent to the user, and we want to ensure that it is only propagated when the metadata output of the children is exactly the same, to avoid unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Union operator does not propagate any metadata output. This makes it impossible to access any metadata if a Union operator is used, even though the children have the exact same metadata output.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.read.load(path1)\r\nval df2 = spark.read.load(path2)\r\ndf1.union(df2).select(\"_metadata.file_path\"). // <-- fails\r\n```\r\nThe issue here is if the datasets unioned do not contain the same metadata, we won't be able to union them. Hence, we will only propagate the metadata if all children have the same metadata (by data type and name), and otherwise do not propagate it. The code for this is similar to the code used in `CheckAnalysis` to check if the output of a Union can be correctly computed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users are now able to select metadata columns through unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests to check that metadata columns can now be accessed through `Union` if the metadata output is the same, and that it is not propagated if the metadata output does not match.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T16:29:29Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T11:39:44Z","closed_at":"2022-12-23T11:39:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52eec96f985b80fce0d619d16554d2d38b67c4fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b34f104f1159dc73341394285bb595a00a34e52","head":{"label":"fred-db:union-metadata-propagation","ref":"union-metadata-propagation","sha":"6b34f104f1159dc73341394285bb595a00a34e52","user":{"login":"fred-db","id":112404801,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrMpQQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112404801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db","html_url":"https://github.com/fred-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":560947292,"node_id":"R_kgDOIW9gXA","name":"spark","full_name":"fred-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fred-db","id":112404801,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrMpQQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112404801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db","html_url":"https://github.com/fred-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fred-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fred-db/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr aims to pull out the details of v1 write files to a new operator `WriteFiles`(logical) `WriteFilesExec`(physical). Then we can make v1 write files support whole stage codegen in future.\r\n\r\nIntroduce `WriteFilesSpec` to hold all v1 write files information:\r\n```scala\r\ncase class WriteFilesSpec(\r\n    description: WriteJobDescription,\r\n    committer: FileCommitProtocol,\r\n    concurrentOutputWriterSpecFunc: SparkPlan => Option[ConcurrentOutputWriterSpec])\r\n  extends WriteSpec\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to compatiable with existed code path, this pr adds a new method `executeWrite` in `SparkPlan`:\r\n```scala\r\ndef executeWrite(writeSpec: WriteSpec): RDD[WriterCommitMessage]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRefactor `FileFormatWriter` to make write files clearly:\r\n- execute write using old code path\r\n- execute write using `SparkPlan.executeWrite`\r\n- extract `writeAndCommit` method to work with both two code path\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is the preparation work before support v1 write whole stage codegen.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nfor user, no\r\n\r\nfor developer, yes:\r\n- add a new method `executeWrite` in `SparkPlan`\r\n- add a new interface `WriteSpec`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR relaxes the current constraint of Storage-Partitioned Join which requires that the partition keys after runtime filtering to be exact the same as the partition keys before the filtering. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Spark requires that when Storage-Partitioned Join is used together with runtime filtering, the partition keys before and after the filtering shall exact match. If not, a `SparkException` is thrown.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not strictly necessary in the case where the partition keys after the filtering is a subset of the original keys. In this scenario, we can use empty partitions for those missing keys in the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nModified an existing test case to match the change.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-06T00:32:35Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T08:01:01Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T15:48:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d8fe3c22615c25b529f2b69186a9482a1d8f8f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38924/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38924/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38924/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b8e735bdc21f4abc0ec155c763203b6de611bfc","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-41398","ref":"SPARK-41398","sha":"2b8e735bdc21f4abc0ec155c763203b6de611bfc","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `InterpretedMutableProjection` to use `setDecimal` rather than `setNullAt` to set null values for decimals in unsafe rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following returns the wrong answer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN;\r\n\r\nselect max(col1), max(col2) from values\r\n(cast(null  as decimal(27,2)), cast(null   as decimal(27,2))),\r\n(cast(77.77 as decimal(27,2)), cast(245.00 as decimal(27,2)))\r\nas data(col1, col2);\r\n\r\n+---------+---------+\r\n|max(col1)|max(col2)|\r\n+---------+---------+\r\n|null     |239.88   |\r\n+---------+---------+\r\n```\r\nThis is because `InterpretedMutableProjection` inappropriately uses `InternalRow#setNullAt` on unsafe rows to set null for decimal types with precision > `Decimal.MAX_LONG_DIGITS`.\r\n\r\nWhen `setNullAt` is used, the pointer to the decimal's storage area in the variable length region gets zeroed out. Later, when `InterpretedMutableProjection` calls `setDecimal` on that field, `UnsafeRow#setDecimal` picks up the zero pointer and stores decimal data on top of the null-tracking bit set. Later updates to the null-tracking bit set (e.g., calls to `setNotNullAt`) further corrupt the decimal data (turning 245.00 into 239.88, for example). The stomping of the null-tracking bit set also can make non-null fields appear null (turning 77.77 into null, for example).\r\n\r\nThis bug can manifest for end-users after codegen fallback (say, if an expression's generated code fails to compile).\r\n\r\n[Codegen for mutable projection](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/89b2ee27d258dec8fe265fa862846e800a374d8e/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/CodeGenerator.scala#L1729) uses `mutableRow.setDecimal` for null decimal values regardless of precision or the type for `mutableRow`, so this PR does the same.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-05T22:35:06Z","updated_at":"2022-12-23T00:09:31Z","closed_at":"2022-12-09T12:44:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7136afc3b9369f5a1c5a07ba4dccd4c6dc9e2761","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/484a7db04e016be5fdfb8754f1329e3b85993115","head":{"label":"bersprockets:unsafe_decimal_issue","ref":"unsafe_decimal_issue","sha":"484a7db04e016be5fdfb8754f1329e3b85993115","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

fields allow a message to contain one and only one of a defined set of field types, while recursive fields provide a way to define messages that can refer to themselves, allowing for the creation of complex and nested data structures.  with this change users will be able to use protobuf OneOf fields with spark-protobuf, making it a more complete and useful tool for processing protobuf data.\r\n\r\n**Support for circularReferenceDepth:**\r\nThe `recursive.fields.max.depth` parameter can be specified in the from_protobuf options to control the maximum allowed recursion depth for a field. Setting `recursive.fields.max.depth` to 0 drops all-recursive fields, setting it to 1 allows it to be recursed once, and setting it to 2 allows it to be recursed twice. Attempting to set the `recursive.fields.max.depth` to a value greater than 10 is not allowed. If the `recursive.fields.max.depth` is not specified, it will default to -1; recursive fields are not permitted. if a protobuf record has more depth for recursive fields than the allowed value, it will be truncated and some fields may be discarded. This check is based on the fully qualified field type.\r\nSQL Schema for the protobuf message\r\n ```\r\nmessage Person { \r\n     string name = 1;\r\n     Person bff = 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill vary based on the value of `recursive.fields.max.depth`.\r\n```\r\n0: struct<name: string, bff: null>\r\n1: struct<name string, bff: <name: string, bff: null>>\r\n2: struct<name string, bff: <name: string, bff: struct<name: string, bff: null>>> ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to prevent `getReusablePVCs` from choosing recently created PVCs in the very previous batch by excluding newly created PVCs whose creation time is within `spark.kubernetes.allocation.batch.delay`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn case of slow K8s control plane situation where `spark.kubernetes.allocation.batch.delay` is too short relatively or `spark.kubernetes.executor.enablePollingWithResourceVersion=true` is used, `onNewSnapshots` may not return the full list of executor pods created by the previous batch. This sometimes makes Spark driver think the PVCs in the previous batch are reusable for the next batch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly created test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to provide cloned spark session in DataFrame in user function for foreachBatch sink in PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's arguable a bug - previously given DataFrame is associated with two different SparkSessions, 1) one which runs the streaming query (accessed via `df.sparkSession`) 2) one which microbatch execution \"cloned\" (accessed via `df._jdf.sparkSession()`). If users pick the 1), it destroys the purpose of cloning spark session, e.g. disabling AQE. Also, which session is picked up depends on the underlying implementation of \"each\" method in DataFrame, which would give inconsistency.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a problematic example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef user_func(batch_df, batch_id):\r\n  batch_df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"updates\")\r\n  ... # what is the right way to refer the temp view \"updates\"?\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the only way to refer the temp view \"updates\" is, using \"internal\" field in DataFrame, `_jdf`. That said, running a new query via `batch_df._jdf.sparkSession()` can only see the temp view defined in the user function. We would like to make this possible without enforcing end users to access \"internal\" field.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, they can (and should) use `batch_df.sparkSession` instead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR makes in sync to which spark session to use. Users can use df.sparkSession to access cloned spark session, which will be the same with the spark session the methods in DataFrame will use.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case which fails with current master branch.","created_at":"2022-12-05T03:17:23Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T05:39:32Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T05:39:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa368a42ea347502b5dd1070bec6474e32f3bf35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement [aggregation functions](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/docs/source/reference/pyspark.sql/functions.rst#aggregate-functions), except:\r\n\r\n1. `approxCountDistinct`, `countDistinct`, `sumDistinct ` - deprecated\r\n2. `count_distinct`, `sum_distinct` - need to support `isDistinct` in proto message `UnresolvedFunction`, I will do it in a followup;\r\n3. `product` - need to add it in `FunctionRegistry`,  I will do it in a followup;\r\n\r\nalso note that:\r\n\r\n1. `grouping` and `grouping` are added in this PR, but can not be used for now: `DataFrame.{cube, rollup}` are still missing, and `grouping() can only be used with GroupingSets/Cube/Rollup`;\r\n2. `median` and `mode` are new APIs added in 3.4.0;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor API coverage\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nnew API\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR enhances the Maven build configuration to automatically detect and switch between using Powershell for Windows and Bash for non-Windows OS to generate `spark-version-info.properties` file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhile building Spark, the `spark-version-info.properties` file [is generated using bash](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d62c18b7497997188ec587e1eb62e75c979c1c93/core/pom.xml#L560-L564). In Windows environment, if Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is installed, it somehow overrides the other bash executables in the PATH, as noted in SPARK-40739. The bash in WSL has a different mounting configuration and thus, [the target location specified for spark-version-info.properties](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d62c18b7497997188ec587e1eb62e75c979c1c93/core/pom.xml#L561-L562) won't be the expected location. Ultimately, this leads to `spark-version-info.properties` to get excluded from the spark-core jar, thus causing the SparkContext initialization to fail with the above depicted error message.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by directing the build system to use the right shell according to the platform.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI tested this by building on a Windows 10 PC.\r\n\r\n```psh\r\nmvn -Pyarn '-Dhadoop.version=3.3.0' -DskipTests clean package\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the build finished, I verified that `spark-version-info.properties` file was included in the spark-core jar.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10280768/205497898-80e53617-c991-460e-b04a-a3bdd4f298ae.png)\r\n\r\nI also ran the SparkPi application and verified that it ran

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd the empty offset filter in `latestOffset()` for Kafka Source, so that offset remains unchanged if Kafka provides no topic partition during fetch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nKafkaOffsetReader may fetch empty partitions in some extreme cases like getting partitions while Kafka cluster is reassigning partitions, this will produce an empty `PartitionOffsetMap` (although there are topic-partitions being unchanged) and stored in `committedOffsets` after `runBatch()`.\r\n\r\nThen in the next batch, we fetch partitions normally and get the actual offsets, but when fetching data of this batch in `KafkaOffsetReaderAdmin#getOffsetRangesFromResolvedOffsets()` all partitions in endOffsets will be considered as new partitions since the startOffsets is empty, then these \"new partitions\" will fetch earliest offsets, which will cause the data duplication.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd an unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-03T19:20:55Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T10:01:49Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T08:12:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a877ca3d53767ab1ce4baa5f9b8d2b0852fa453","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe split the current `connector/connect` project into two projects:\r\n- `connector/connect/common`: this contains the proto definitions, and build targets for proto buf related code generation. In the future this can also contain utilities that are shared between the server and the client.\r\n- `connector/connect/server`: this contains the code for the connect server and plugin (all the current scala code). This includes the dsl because it is used for server related tests. In the future we might replace the DSL by the scala client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn preparation for the Spark Connect Scala Client we need to split the server and the proto files. This, together with another refactoring in Catalyst, will allow us to create a client with a minimal set of dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-02T15:21:34Z","updated_at":"2022-12-06T06:05:51Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T00:48:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8133ab07055d70476e240665374949404b9e6411","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a693ef0b7e2c29d54760136951973f7cb589f2ae","head":{"label":"vicennial:refactorConnect-finalShade","ref":"refactorConnect-finalShade","sha":"a693ef0b7e2c29d54760136951973f7cb589f2ae","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is a major refactor of how Spark resolves columns. Today, the column resolution logic is placed in several rules, which makes it hard to understand. It's also very fragile to maintain the resolution precedence, as you have to carefully deal with the interactions between these rules.\r\n\r\nThis PR centralizes the column resolution logic into a single rule: the existing `ResolveReferences` rule, so that we no longer need to worry about the interactions between multiple rules. The detailed resolution precedence is also documented.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the config `spark.sql.sources.useV1SourceList` doesn't work with V2 file tables in session catalog, it is always the V1 path that is used. This PR enables V2 file tables (if they are not in `spark.sql.sources.useV1SourceList`) in read paths via session catalog and fixes a few issues where V2 behaves differently to V1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt would be good if we could use the already available V2 file source implmenentaions with the session catalog. We ran into a few problems with V2 optimization paths that want to fix in the future. But, currently Spark don't have built-in catalog support for any of the V2 file table implementations. As a first step this PR enables V2 controlled by `spark.sql.sources.useV1SourceList` for the select query plans only. All commands and `InsertIntoStatement` remain using V1 implementations.\r\n\r\nThe PR also contains some test changes:\r\n- `SQLQuerySuite` is splitted into V1 and V2 versions.\r\n- V2 versions of `OrcPartitionDiscoverySuite` and `ParquetPartitionDiscoverySuite` are modified to behave like the V1 versions do. Basically the order of output columns changed in the edge case when partitioning and data columns overlap.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, see order of output columns when partitioning and data columns overlap.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-02T13:27:34Z","updated_at":"2023-06-25T00:25:54Z","closed_at":"2023-06-25T00:25:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60b8bd3ed29f6eb63b32dd9d7b5e8088cb7e83cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nStages UI page fails to load for proxy in some specific yarn environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMy environment CDH 5.8 , click to enter the spark UI from the yarn Resource Manager page\r\nwhen visit the stage URI, it fails to load,  URI is\r\nhttp://<yarn-url>:8088/proxy/application_1669877165233_0021/stages/stage/?id=0&attempt=0 \r\n\r\nThe issue is similar to, the final phenomenon of the issue is the same, because the parameter

encode twice:\r\n1. https redirect proxy\r\n2. set reverse proxy enabled (spark.ui.reverseProxy)  in Nginx \r\n\r\nBut if encode twice due to other reasons, such as this issue (yarn proxy), it will also fail when visit stage page.\r\nIt is better to decode parameter twice here. \r\nJust like fix here [SPARK-12708](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12708)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to clear the write batch (and also corresponding prefix iterators) after commit has succeeded on RocksDB state store. This PR also fixes the test case as side effect, as it had been relying on the \"sort of bug\" that we didn't clean up write batch till either rollback or load has been called.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this, the memory usage of WriteBatch for RocksDB state store is \"accumulated\" over the partitions in the same executor. Say, 10 partitions in stateful operator are assigned to an executor and run sequentially. Given that we didn't clear write batch after commit, when the executor processes the last partition assigned to it, 10 WriteBatch instances contain all writes being performed in this microbatch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a sort of bugfix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, with fixing the test case.","created_at":"2022-12-02T09:47:17Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T06:51:51Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T06:51:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e81f24412f840999822ed75d76fa1abc74bd30c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe problem can be reproduced in the following way:\r\n```shell\r\nspark-sql> CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t1 AS VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b') tbl(c1, c2);\r\n\r\nspark-sql> CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t2 AS VALUES (1.0, 1), (2.0, 4) tbl(c1, c2); \r\n\r\nspark-sql> SELECT\r\n         > TRANSFORM(*) USING 'cat' AS (a)\r\n         > FROM\r\n         > (\r\n         > SELECT c2 AS c from t2\r\n         > UNION\r\n         > SELECT c2 AS c from t1);\r\nInvalid call to toAttribute on unresolved object\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that when WidenSetOperationTypes rewrites the reference of the parent plan (possibly Unresolved), it will call the references of the parent plan to obtain all Attributes.\r\n\r\nScriptTransformation overrides references, and it takes `child.output` as references.\r\n\r\nThis problem may occur if the child of ScriptTransformation is Unresolved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfix the

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR majorly proposes to reject the block manager re-registration if the executor has been already considered lost/dead from the scheduler backend.\r\n\r\nAlong with the major proposal, this PR also includes a few other changes:\r\n* Only post `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` event when the registration succeeds\r\n* Return an \"invalid\" executor id when the re-registration fails\r\n* Do not report all blocks when the re-registration fails\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBlockManager re-registration from lost executor (terminated/terminating executor or orphan executor) has led to some known issues, e.g., false-active executor shows up in UP (SPARK-35011), [block fetching to the dead executor](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32114#issuecomment-899979045). And since there's no re-registration from the lost executor itself, it's meaningless to have BlockManager re-registration when the executor is already lost.\r\n\r\nRegarding the corner case where the re-registration event comes earlier before the lost executor is actually removed from the scheduler backend, I think it is not possible. Because re-registration will only be required when the BlockManager doesn't see the block manager in `blockManagerInfo`. And the block manager will only be removed from `blockManagerInfo` whether when the executor is already know lost or removed by the driver proactively. So the executor should always be removed from the scheduler backend first before the re-registration event comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

The main difference of course being that spark arrays are 1-indexed, while snowflake arrays are 0-indexed, hence the definition of array_insert will differ by one index for positive numbers.\r\n\r\n#### Arguments\r\narr: Array of anytype of elements in which the element has to be appended.\r\npos: name of Numeric type column indicating position of insertion (starting index 1).\r\nitem: Value for insertion into arr. The type of element has to match with the type of elements array is holding.\r\n\r\n`select array_insert(array(1, 2, 3), 3, 4);`\r\n| array_insert(array(1, 2, 3), 3, 4) |\r\n|------------------------------------|\r\n| [1, 2, 3, 4]                       |\r\n\r\n#### Support in other frameworks\r\n[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json-modification-functions.html#function_json-array-insert)\r\n\r\n[Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/array_insert.html)\r\n\r\n[SQL Notebook](https://sqlnotebook.com/array-insert-func.html)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImplementation of an existing snowflake function that is not yet in spark. Use cases include adding arbitrary elements to a list at a given index.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo changes to existing APIs; addition of a new array_insert function that can be accessed via Scala Spark and PySpark\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests at CollectionExpressionSuite (scala implementation class), DataFrameFunctionsSuite,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend SparkSession API and override the `sql` method by:\r\n```scala\r\n  def sql(sqlText: String, args: Map[String, String]): DataFrame\r\n```\r\nwhich accepts a map with:\r\n- keys are parameters names,\r\n- values are SQL literal values.\r\n\r\nAnd the first argument `sqlText` might have named parameters in the positions of constants like literal values.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\n  spark.sql(\r\n    sqlText = \"SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE date > :startDate LIMIT :maxRows\",\r\n    args = Map(\r\n      \"startDate\" -> \"DATE'2022-12-01'\",\r\n      \"maxRows\" -> \"100\"))\r\n```\r\nThe new `sql()` method parses the input SQL statement and provided parameter values, and replaces the named parameters by the literal values. And then it eagerly runs DDL/DML commands, but not for SELECT queries.\r\n\r\nCloses #38712\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve user experience with Spark SQL via\r\n    - Using Spark as remote service (microservice).\r\n    - Write SQL code that will power reports, dashboards, charts and other data presentation solutions that need to account for criteria modifiable by users through an interface.\r\n    - Build a generic integration layer based on the SQL API. The goal is to expose managed data to a wide application ecosystem with a microservice architecture. It is only natural in such a setup to ask for modular and reusable SQL code, that can be executed repeatedly with different parameter values.\r\n\r\n2. To achieve feature parity with other systems that support named parameters:\r\n    - Redshift: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/data-api.html#data-api-calling\r\n    - BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/parameterized-queries#api\r\n    - MS DBSQL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/user/queries/query-parameters\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a regression caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37758 . In https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37758 , we decided to only allow qualified name access for using/natural join hidden columns, to fix other problems around hidden columns.\r\n\r\nWe thought that is not a breaking change, as you can only access the join hidden columns by qualified names to disambiguate. However, one case is missed: when we wrap the join with a subquery alias, the ambiguity is gone and we should allow simple name access.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by removing the qualified access only restriction in `SubqueryAlias.output`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix a regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, certain querys that failed with `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN` before this PR can work now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR propose to change the name of `UnresolvedFunction` from a sequence of name parts to a single name string, which help to move the function name parsing to server side.\r\n\r\nFor built-in functions, there is no need to even call SQL parser to parse the name (built-in functions should not belong to any catalog or database).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis will help reduce redundant implementation on client sides to parse function names. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA RocksDB `WriteBatch` (and by extension `WriteBatchWithIndex`) stores its underlying data in a `std::string`. Why? I'm not sure. But after a partition is finished, `writeBatch.clear()` is called (somewhat indirectly through a call to `store.abort`), presumably clearing the data in the `WriteBatch`. This calls `std::string::clear` followed by `std::string::resize` underneath the hood. However, neither of these two things actually reclaims native memory. All the memory allocated for expanding the string when adding data to the `WriteBatch` will be there until the `std::string` is deallocated, which in this case means deleting the `WriteBatch`. This leads to native memory accumulation on an executor and it executes several partitions consecutively, which would happen when your total executor cores is less than your shuffle partitions for your stateful stream. So instead of just calling `writeBatch.clear()`, close the `WriteBatch` and create a new one to free up the native memory.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFix for excess native memory usage.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs, not sure how to test for memory

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWait for shuffle fetch to finish when decommissioning executors by checking number of opening streams.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen shuffle fetch with some opening streams is in progress and executor self-exit after decommission, there'll be fetch failed caused by executor self-exit.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday, the way we resolve outer references is very inefficient. It invokes the entire analyzer to resolve the subquery plan, then transforms the plan to resolve `UnresolvedAttribute` to outer references. If the plan is still unresolved, repeat the process until the plan is resolved or the plan doesn't change any more. Ideally, we should only invoke the analyzer once to resolve subquery plans.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new rule to resolve outer references, and put it in the main analyzer batch. Then we can safely invoke the analyzer only once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSimplify the subquery resolution code and make it more efficient\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting
