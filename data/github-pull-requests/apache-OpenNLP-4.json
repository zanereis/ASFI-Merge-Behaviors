you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThis is a PR on the basis of https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/385 with the JUnit 4 test by @avanco \r\n\r\nAs commented in https://github.com/apache/opennlp/pull/385, this PR proposes to re-create and dispose the `DictionaryLookup`, which is \" is cheap to create and dispose (so it makes no sense to cache)\" according to https://github.com/morfologik/morfologik-stemming/issues/69 - it avoids the explicit sychronization of the method.\r\n\r\nI did not squash the commits to retain @avanco code contributions / authorship.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-19T19:14:44Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T14:32:57Z","closed_at":"2022-11-23T14:32:49Z","merged_at":"2022-11-23T14:32:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"6212a940350b4f579d9d040591dac43293cb0b73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/pulls/436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/pulls/436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/statuses/8a8e584192a8ddfdee84f046b29aac5fcae7dd3c","head":{"label":"rzo1:threadsafe-lemmatize","ref":"threadsafe-lemmatize","sha":"8a8e584192a8ddfdee84f046b29aac5fcae7dd3c","user":{"login":"rzo1","id":13417392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDE3Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13417392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1","html_url":"https://github.com/rzo1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558980093,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVFb_Q","name":"opennlp","full_name":"rzo1/opennlp","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rzo1","id":13417392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDE3Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13417392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1","html_url":"https://github.com/rzo1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rzo1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rzo1/opennlp","description":"Mirror

Security Vulnerability Fix\n\nThis pull request fixes a Temporary File Information Disclosure Vulnerability, which existed in this project.\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe system temporary directory is shared between all users on most unix-like systems (not MacOS, or Windows). Thus, code interacting with the system temporary directory must be careful about file interactions in this directory, and must ensure that the correct file posix permissions are set.\n\nThis PR was generated because a call to `File.createTempFile(..)` was detected in this repository in a way that makes this project vulnerable to local information disclosure.\nWith the default uname configuration, `File.createTempFile(..)` creates a file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file.\n\n### Impact\n\nInformation in this file is visible to other local users, allowing a malicious actor co-resident on the same machine to view potentially sensitive files.\n\n#### Other Examples\n\n - [CVE-2020-15250](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp) - junit-team/junit\n - [CVE-2021-21364](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hpv8-9rq5-hq7w) - swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2) - netty/netty\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q) - netty/netty\n\n# The Fix\n\nThe fix has been to convert the logic above to use the following API that was introduced in Java 1.7.\n\n```java\nFile tmpDir = Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\").toFile();\n```\n\nThe API both creates the file securely, ie. with a random, non-conflicting name, with file permissions that only allow the currently executing user to read or write the contents of this file.\nBy default, `Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\")` will create a file with the permissions `-rw-------`, which only allows the user that created the file to view/write the file contents.\n\n# :arrow_right: Vulnerability Disclosure :arrow_left:\n\n:wave: Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!\n\nFirst question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!\n\n 1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!\n 2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To\n\nYou have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:\n\n 1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.\n 2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the [Snyk's Disclosure Email](mailto:report@snyk.io).\n\n## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\n\nThis vulnerability was automatically detected by GitHub's CodeQL using this [CodeQL Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure/).\n\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).\n\nI'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.\n\n## Source\n\nThis contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly hand crafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\n\nThe source code that generated this PR can be found here:\n[SecureTempFileCreation](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/SecureTempFileCreation.java)\n\n## Opting-Out\n\nIf you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:\n\n```\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research\nDisallow: *\n```\n\nThis bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.\n\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.\n\n## CLA Requirements\n\n_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._\n\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin\n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Sponsorship & Support\n\nThis contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.\n\nThis PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.\n\n## Tracking\n\nAll PR's generated as part of this fix are tracked here:

Security Vulnerability Fix\n\nThis pull request fixes a Temporary File Information Disclosure Vulnerability, which existed in this project.\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe system temporary directory is shared between all users on most unix-like systems (not MacOS, or Windows). Thus, code interacting with the system temporary directory must be careful about file interactions in this directory, and must ensure that the correct file posix permissions are set.\n\nThis PR was generated because a call to `File.createTempFile(..)` was detected in this repository in a way that makes this project vulnerable to local information disclosure.\nWith the default uname configuration, `File.createTempFile(..)` creates a file with the permissions `-rw-r--r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the contents of this file.\n\n### Impact\n\nInformation in this file is visible to other local users, allowing a malicious actor co-resident on the same machine to view potentially sensitive files.\n\n#### Other Examples\n\n - [CVE-2020-15250](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp) - junit-team/junit\n - [CVE-2021-21364](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hpv8-9rq5-hq7w) - swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2) - netty/netty\n - [CVE-2022-24823](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-269q-hmxg-m83q) - netty/netty\n\n# The Fix\n\nThe fix has been to convert the logic above to use the following API that was introduced in Java 1.7.\n\n```java\nFile tmpDir = Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\").toFile();\n```\n\nThe API both creates the file securely, ie. with a random, non-conflicting name, with file permissions that only allow the currently executing user to read or write the contents of this file.\nBy default, `Files.createTempFile(\"temp dir\")` will create a file with the permissions `-rw-------`, which only allows the user that created the file to view/write the file contents.\n\n# :arrow_right: Vulnerability Disclosure :arrow_left:\n\n:wave: Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!\n\nFirst question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!\n\n 1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!\n 2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To\n\nYou have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:\n\n 1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.\n 2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the [Snyk's Disclosure Email](mailto:report@snyk.io).\n\n## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\n\nThis vulnerability was automatically detected by GitHub's CodeQL using this [CodeQL Query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-local-temp-file-or-directory-information-disclosure/).\n\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).\n\nI'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.\n\n## Source\n\nThis contribution was automatically generated with an [OpenRewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) [refactoring recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/), which was lovingly hand crafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\n\nThe source code that generated this PR can be found here:\n[SecureTempFileCreation](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-java-security/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/java/security/SecureTempFileCreation.java)\n\n## Opting-Out\n\nIf you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:\n\n```\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/security-research\nDisallow: *\n```\n\nThis bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.\n\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.\n\n## CLA Requirements\n\n_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._\n\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin\n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n## Sponsorship & Support\n\nThis contribution is sponsored by HUMAN Security Inc. and the new Dan Kaminsky Fellowship, a fellowship created to celebrate Dan's memory and legacy by funding open-source work that makes the world a better (and more secure) place.\n\nThis PR was generated by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/), a free-for-open source SaaS offering that uses format-preserving AST transformations to fix bugs, standardize code style, apply best practices, migrate library versions, and fix common security vulnerabilities at scale.\n\n## Tracking\n\nAll PR's generated as part of this fix are tracked here:

you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n# Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThis PR solves https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-1391\r\n\r\nHowever, it requires an INFRA ticket (created by a **PMC** member) to setup **secrets.NEXUS_USER** and\r\n**secrets.NEXUS_PW** for this project, see [1] or [2] for reference.\r\n\r\nThe action isn't tested on the OPENNLP repository (no permissions obviously), but should work fine, if the related **secrets** are set by INFRA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.mail-archive.com/builds@apache.org/msg08188.html\r\n[2]

Automatically convert JUnit 4 via https://github.com/junit-pioneer/convert-junit4-to-junit5 (sadly, it doesn't guarantee formatting)\r\n- Format the converted classes according to the OpenNLP style guide via the provided IntelliJ Formatter rules. \r\n- Manually adjust test cases, in which an automatic conversion wasn't possible due to method signature ambiquity (mostly eps/delta for float/double comparisions, String comparisions with messages).\r\n- Replacement of `@TemporaryFolder` rules with `@TempDir` and related compensation code.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversion I run a `mvn clean install -Pjacoco`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Build Order:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO]

OPENNLP-1350\r\n\r\nThe `MAIL_REGEX` in `UrlCharSSequenceNormalizer` causes `replaceAll(...)` to become extremely costly when given an input string with a long sequence of characters from the first character set in the regex, but which ultimately fails to match the whole regex. This pull request fixes that, and also another detail:\r\n\r\nAllow `+` in the local part, and disallow `_` in the domain part. There are other characters that are allowed in the local part as well, but these are less common (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address).\r\n\r\nThe speedup for unfortunate input is achieved by adding a negative lookbehind with a single characters from the first character set. \r\nCurrently, the replaceAll(\" \") on a string of ~100K characters from the set `[-_.0-9A-Za-z]` runs in ~1minute on modern hardware; adding a negative lookbehind with one of the characters from that set reduces this to a few milliseconds, and is functionally equivalent. (Consider the current pattern and a match from position `i` to `k`. If the character at `i-1` is in the character set, there would also be a match from `i-1` to `k`, which would already be

Jira\r\n\r\n- [OPENNLP-1338](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP-1338)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n#### Replace test class [DummyNameFinder](https://github.com/apache/opennlp/blob/7286f9c804b65a4a1d771d3c984ea76516fc8141/opennlp-tools/src/test/java/opennlp/tools/namefind/TokenNameFinderEvaluatorTest.java#L95) by mocking object and improve test design\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Motivation\r\n\r\n- Decouple test class `DummyNameFinder` from production interface `TokenNameFinder`.\r\n- Remove the redundant test child class `PrintingVisitor`\r\n- Remove the redundant overridden methods `clearAdaptiveData()`\r\n- Make testing logic more explict.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Created mocking object to replace test subclass `DummyNameFinder`, decoupled test from production code.\r\n * Created method that return the mocking object for code reuse.\r\n * Add Mockito dependency.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a large pull request. There are no functional changes. The changes in this pull request abstract out OpenNLP's interfaces into a new project called `opennlp-common`. The implementation of those interfaces stay in `opennlp-tools`. Applications that use OpenNLP should not require any changes as a result of this pull request.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to support deep learning frameworks. New NLP implementations can implement the existing OpenNLP interfaces. It also keeps dependencies separate and not required between implementations. This change is illustrated here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENNLP/OpenNLP+2.x\r\n\r\nIt is my goal that after this refactoring, the project can start working toward deep learning implementation for OpenNLP 2.0 by starting to implement those interfaces\r\n\r\n- Unit tests pass and the evaluation tests will also be run prior to merge.\r\n- There may be some whitespace changes and import reodering due to addressing checkstyle warnings.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for contributing to Apache OpenNLP.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with OPENNLP-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn clean install at the root opennlp folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file in opennlp folder?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found in opennlp folder?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-01T13:56:14Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T21:57:02Z","closed_at":"2021-12-23T21:57:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f31e98071143aa66a00db5cecada114607f4cc0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/pulls/395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/pulls/395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/issues/395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/opennlp/statuses/f4d1893bfb2260385f32cec213bfcc951128a321","head":{"label":"jzonthemtn:OPENNLP-1331","ref":"OPENNLP-1331","sha":"f4d1893bfb2260385f32cec213bfcc951128a321","user":{"login":"jzonthemtn","id":13176962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc2OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13176962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn","html_url":"https://github.com/jzonthemtn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62673409,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjY3MzQwOQ==","name":"opennlp","full_name":"jzonthemtn/opennlp","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jzonthemtn","id":13176962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc2OTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13176962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn","html_url":"https://github.com/jzonthemtn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzonthemtn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jzonthemtn/opennlp","description":"Mirror

test `opennlp.tools.ml.naivebayes.NaiveBayesSerializedCorrectnessTest#testPlainTextModel` can fail due to a different iteration order of HashMap.

However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit
