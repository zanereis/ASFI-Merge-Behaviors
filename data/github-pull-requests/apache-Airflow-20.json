used the wrong keys for retrieving user and password from the boto3 redshift-serverless client response, leading to `KeyError` exceptions. This change uses the correct camel-cased `dbUser` and `dbPassword` keys; the boto3 redshift client response returns the Pascal-cased `DbUser` and `DbPassword` and these were mistakenly copied into the

adds support to display all events under browse page. This also adds support to display events only related to the dag under events tab in dag details which is basically filter by dag_id in the API when dag_id is present in the URL. The events per dag skips dag_id column which is redundant.\r\n\r\nAdd support to filter by when, event_log_id which needs to be replaced in the backend before querying. This was done in the legacy API connexion code and the same support is added here https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/e50206563001337befad7a8fe70e9c3df1a98fcc/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/event_log_endpoint.py#L78\r\n\r\nNotes for self and review : \r\n\r\n1. eslint fails with below error that `<Time />` cannot be constructed for `when` column but I have seen this pattern used elsewhere and also previously when dags list page only had timestamp for next/last dagrun as `<Time />`\r\n\r\n> /home/karthikeyan/stuff/python/airflow/airflow/ui/src/pages/Events/Events.tsx\r\n> 56:13  error  Do not define components during render. React will see a new component type on every render and destroy the entire subtree’s DOM nodes and state (https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#elements-of-different-types). Instead, move this component definition out of the parent component “Events” and pass data as props. If you want to allow component creation in props, set allowAsProps option to true  react/no-unstable-nested-component\r\n\r\n2. Legacy UI does sorting by `when` in descending manner by default to display latest events first. I have passed it to `useTableURLState` as default yet somehow this is not working.\r\n3. When there are no events the page displays `No Eventss found` where Events has a double s which needs to be fixed.\r\n4. extra column is usually a json and might need a followup PR in new UI to pretty display JSON like legacy UI.\r\n5. The events table under the dag details tab on scroll pushes the column of the table up and needs to be fixed.

It was impossible to use it without copying - the repository has a dependency on SQLAlchemy > 2.0. (problem was described here https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/995cd8fba8de4ab3d041c7e141a0b92d786a8277/providers/src/airflow/providers/ydb/hooks/_vendor/readme.md)\r\n\r\nAt the moment we split the DBAPI and SQLAlchemy Dialect, so now there are no conflicts between them. \r\n\r\nIn this pull request, we delete the copied files, adding a new dependency on the ydb-dbapi package, and also adapt the current YDB Operator to the new dbapi. \r\n\r\nYDBScanQueryOperator was more of an experiment, the new YDBExecuteQueryOperator on top of the new dbapi covers all scenarios - no need to stop it (as

sets \"--skip-tag-check\" since this will release a subversion against a tag that already exists.\r\n\r\nI'm sure more work is needed here; I look forward to reviews.","created_at":"2024-11-07T01:08:34Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T16:10:44Z","closed_at":"2024-11-18T02:45:45Z","merged_at":"2024-11-18T02:45:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"681651d7e7c2a4521fda45736d80470069136974","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/43769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/43769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/43769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0b4315057f9b8de8506c52db0311b82a254e5c45","head":{"label":"perry2of5:add-local-build-flag","ref":"add-local-build-flag","sha":"0b4315057f9b8de8506c52db0311b82a254e5c45","user":{"login":"perry2of5","id":181138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5","html_url":"https://github.com/perry2of5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":835854711,"node_id":"R_kgDOMdIhdw","name":"apache-airflow","full_name":"perry2of5/apache-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"perry2of5","id":181138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTEzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5","html_url":"https://github.com/perry2of5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perry2of5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_ad

`uv 0.4.30` has some strange resolution bug that results in inconsistent dependencies in opentelemetry that are detected by `pip check` when we are running eager upgrade. This is described in detail in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8871 . Until the issue is diagnosed and Solved, we workaround it by providing a hint to `uv` to use higher version of opentelemetry-proto than it wants to downgrade to - for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

doc: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-72+Task+Execution+Interface+aka+Task+SDK\r\nPart of https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/405/views/1\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a new endpoint, `/execution/connection/{connection_id}`, in the Execution API to retrieve connection details. \r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds:\r\n- `get_connection` endpoint to fetch connection details by `connection_id` from all secrets backend. For the deployments that don’t want to get conns from all secres backend — they could not set Secrets backend on API Server.. that way it falls back to DB.\r\n- Placeholder function `get_task_token()` for token-based access control.\r\n- Placeholder `check_connection_access` function to validate task permissions for each connection request.\r\n\r\n### Access control\r\n- Access to connections is determined by the `allowed_connections` attribute in the task token (currently mocked).\r\n- Endpoint returns a 403 Forbidden status if the task does not have permission for the requested connection.\r\n- Placeholder `get_task_token()` function simulates task authentication; future updates will include JWT-based authentication.\r\n\r\n### Future Work\r\n- Replace the placeholder `get_task_token()` with actual JWT-based authentication to dynamically determine task permissions. This would be done more holistically.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Because we faced the bug, in case when the user specified `namespace` in the task and inside the metadata for  `pod_request_obj` user has a different namespace. Then `namespace` will be overwritten by the value which is specified in the task.  This priority looks incorrect, because in the `find_pod` function we need to find a Pod which has already started. And information about this Pod inside the `pod_request_obj` variable. It means that firstly we need to check value in `pod_request_obj.metadata.namespace` and, then, value inside `self.namespace`.      \r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

This PR only impacts the common-sql provider, also a dedicated unit test has been added for the handlers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

Description\r\n\r\nEdge worker supported at the current state only concurrency. Every job reduced the available concurrency by one. If worker had  concurrency of 8 then 8 jobs can run parallel. Concurrency is now switched to capacity. \r\n\r\nThe idea behind is that not all jobs on a worker which runs parallel are consuming the same amount of resources. Now it is possible to set need_capacity value for a job which need more resources. By default the need_capacity is 1 for each job. If worker has capacity of 2 and executes one job with 2 then no new job is executed by the worker. But if a job with need_capacity of 1 is executed a second job with need_capacity of 1 can be executed in parallel. \r\n\r\nFor detailed information check the edge_executor.rst changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n# Details about changes \r\n\r\n* Concurrency is renamed to capacity\r\n* Job can use the executor_config to define the need_capacitiy\r\n* edge_job table includes new column need_capacity\r\n* Free_capacity of a worker is exported as metric\r\n* As alembic provider migration will be supported inAirflow 3 and Edge package is not fully released yet, a workaround is implemented to drop old table and create new edge_job table.","created_at":"2024-11-06T12:01:41Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T16:12:14Z","closed_at":"2024-11-27T16:12:13Z","merged_at":"2024-11-27T16:12:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"90442e85775eaffb2c9936ad7859899ef625d619","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":7374143406,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABt4h_rg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/AIP-69","name":"AIP-69","color":"40DF69","default":false,"description":"Edge

PR addresses [Issue #43381](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43381) by adding `data-testid `attributes to key UI components to improve stability and reliability for automated testing and external tools.\r\n\r\n**Why This Change?**\r\nCurrently, UI lacks reliable identifiers for DOM elements, making automation difficult and unstable. Using sibling and child selectors is not a dependable approach. Adding `data-testid `attributes provides a robust solution, allowing automation frameworks and external tools to interact with UI elements consistently.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nVerified that the added `data-testid `attributes do not interfere with the UI's functionality.\r\nConducted tests to ensure elements are correctly identified and manipulated by automation scripts.\r\nRelated Issue\r\nFixes [Issue #43381](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43381).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-06T11:49:42Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T13:41:49Z","closed_at":"2024-11-06T13:41:47Z","merged_at":"2024-11-06T13:41:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"7f4b7fdea28eeefbc4803c2949f4df62be8e525d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

(#43683)\r\n\r\nAfter some checks it turned out that reproducibility of produced packages depends not only on the build backend configured for the project but also on the build front-end used - because frontend is the one to modify meta-data in prepared packages - including the build tool used, it's version and metadata version supported by the front-end.\r\n\r\nThat's why in order to maintain reproducibility for anyone who builds the packages, we have to pin not only the build backend in pyproject.toml (flit-core) but also build fronted used (flit).\r\n\r\nSince package preparation is done with breeze, we can do it by pinning flit (and just in case also flit-core) so that anyone who builds specific version of the package will use exactly the same flit as the person who built the original packages.\r\n\r\nThis way we will avoid reproducibility problems experienced with 1.5.0 release of FAB.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

some checks it turned out that reproducibility of produced packages depends not only on the build backend configured for the project but also on the build front-end used - because frontend is the one to modify meta-data in prepared packages - including the build tool used, it's version and metadata version supported by the front-end.\r\n\r\nThat's why in order to maintain reproducibility for anyone who builds the packages, we have to pin not only the build backend in pyproject.toml (flit-core) but also build fronted used (flit).\r\n\r\nSince package preparation is done with breeze, we can do it by pinning flit (and just in case also flit-core) so that anyone who builds specific version of the package will use exactly the same flit as the person who built the original packages.\r\n\r\nThis way we will avoid reproducibility problems experienced with 1.5.0 release of FAB.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more

The functions now use `run_id` as the sole identifier for DAG runs, simplifying the process and eliminating deprecated behaviour.\r\n\r\n### **Motivation**:\r\nIn Airflow, `execution_date` has historically been used to distinguish different DAG run instances. However, the introduction of `run_id` and the DAG run concept in Airflow 2.2 shifts away from using `execution_date` as an identifier. Continuing to rely on `execution_date` introduces limitations, such as the inability to handle multiple DAG runs at the same logical time, especially in cases like `TriggerDagRunOperator` when dynamic runs are generated.\r\n\r\nBy removing `execution_date` in favor of `run_id`, this PR eliminates these limitations. This also removes the unique constraint on `execution_date` at the database level, paving the way for a cleaner and more flexible scheduling system in Airflow 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-05T08:22:35Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T12:15:54Z","closed_at":"2024-11-15T12:15:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1937475224,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3NDc1MjI0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:API","name":"area:API","color":"efe07c","default":false,"description":"Airflow's REST/HTTP API"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
