had a race condition when the containers were started. All `airflow-*` containers were started simultaneously, but airflow-worker, airflow-scheduler and airflow-webserver require the database to be initialized first. This was sometimes done before the containers were started, but sometimes the container referred to a table that was not migrated.  Now the database is always initialized before the rest of the containers are started.\r\n\r\nExample: https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CCQ7EGB1P/p1621711385211600\r\nCC: @marclamberti\r\nPS.

Here is the class you should modify: airflow/providers/amazon/aws/utils/emailer.py\r\n3. Tests for email class are in: tests/providers/amazon/aws/utils/test_emailer.py\r\n4. Run the tests in Local Virtualenv: LOCAL_VIRTUALENV.rst\r\n5. Run the tests in Breeze: BREEZE.rst\r\n7. Run airflow webserver and scheduler and configure it to send emails and connect to a real AWS account and test if the email is sent with the SES Backend\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

started to use `@AwsBaseHook.retry(should_retry)` on `_start_task` of the `ECSOperator` in Airflow 2.1.0 (or providers-amazon >= 1.3.0). https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/304e174674ff6921cb7ed79c0158949b50eff8fe/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/ecs.py#L224\r\nwhich is a little bit tricky according to AWS support:\r\n* The `response['failures']` is not always reliable, which means an ECS task may still be provisioned successfully even when we get \"failures\" in the `response`. The only way to be sure is to use `DescribeTasks` to see if the task is provisioned correctly.\r\n\r\nWith the `@AwsBaseHook.retry(should_retry)` on `_start_task()`, i started to see my Airflow sending multiple `RunTask` events to AWS for the same task and I ended up with multiple instances running and they are interfering with each other since they require the same back-end resources. This also creates many \"ghost\" ECS tasks that are not under Airflow's radar and quite difficult to debug :crying_cat_face:\r\n\r\nI don't know if using the retry is a way of dealing with this https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/15000 issue.\r\nBut i'd rather go back to the old way at the moment.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss further on this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

PR was created after a discussion in this [post](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388#issuecomment-848867351). @potiuk asked to be mentioned here so he can work with us to integrate those gradual changes. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this PR is to gradually enable support for the Windows Platform. The changes in this PR allow Airflow to be used with on a Windows System as Dask-Worker. Other things like Web-Server and Task-Scheduling are not possible because of the way processes are handled in Airflow.

was a problem that when we initialized configuration, we've run\r\nvalidate() which - among others - checkd if the connection is an `sqlite`\r\nbut when the SQLAlchemy connection was not configured via variable but\r\nvia secret manager, it has fallen back to secret_backend, which should\r\nbe configured via conf and initialized.\r\nThe problem is that the \"conf\" object is not yet created, because\r\nthe \"validate()\" method has not finished yet and\r\n\"initialize_configuration\" has not yet returned.\r\nThis led to snake eating its own tail.\r\n\r\nThis PR defers the validate() method to after secret backends have\r\nbeen initialized. The effect of it is that secret backends might\r\nbe initialized with configuration that is not valid, but there are\r\nno real negative consequences of this.\r\n\r\nFixes: #16079\r\nFixes: #15685\r\n\r\nstarting\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

commit adds an optimization where the recently modified files\r\n(detected by mtime) will be parsed even though it has not reached\r\n`min_file_process_interval`.\r\n\r\nThis way you can increase `[scheduler] min_file_process_interval` to\r\na higher value like `600` or so when you have large number of files to\r\navoid unnecessary reparsing if files haven't changed, while still making\r\nsure

#15938\r\n\r\n`multiprocessing.Pool` is known to often become stuck. It causes celery_executor to hang randomly. This happens at least on Debian, Ubuntu using Python 3.8.7 and Python 3.8.10. The issue is reproducible by running `test_send_tasks_to_celery_hang` in this PR several times (with db backend set to something other than sqlite because sqlite disables some parallelization) \r\n\r\nThe issue goes away once switched to `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`. In python 3.6 and earlier, `ProcessPoolExecutor` has no `initializer` argument. Fortunately, it's not needed because `reset_signal` is no longer needed because the signal handler now checks if the current process is the parent.","created_at":"2021-05-21T14:27:27Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T15:00:55Z","closed_at":"2021-05-29T15:00:54Z","merged_at":"2021-05-29T15:00:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"f75dd7ae6e755dad328ba6f3fd462ade194dab25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including
