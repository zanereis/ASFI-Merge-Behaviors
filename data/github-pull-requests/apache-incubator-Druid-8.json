main change adds \"cpu\" and \"wall\" counters. The \"cpu\" counter measures CPU time (using `JvmUtils.getCurrentThreadCpuTime`) taken up by processors in processing threads. The \"wall\" counter measures the amount of wall time taken up by processors in those same processing threads. Both counters are broken down by type of processor.\r\n\r\nThis patch also includes changes to support adding new counters. Due to an oversight in the original design, older deserializers are not forwards-compatible; they throw errors when encountering an unknown counter type. To manage this, the following changes are made:\r\n\r\n1) The defaultImpl `NilQueryCounterSnapshot` is added to `QueryCounterSnapshot`'s deserialization configuration. This means that any unrecognized counter types will be read as `nil` by deserializers. Going forward, once all servers are on the latest code, this is enough to enable easily adding new counters.\r\n\r\n2) A new context parameter `includeAllCounters` is added, which defaults to \"false\". When this parameter is set `false`, only legacy counters are included. When set to `true`, all counters are included. This is currently undocumented. In a future version, we should set the default to `true`, and at that time, include a release note that people updating from versions prior to Druid 31 should set this to `false` until their upgrade is complete.","created_at":"2024-08-16T20:54:37Z","updated_at":"2024-08-31T03:02:33Z","closed_at":"2024-08-31T03:02:31Z","merged_at":"2024-08-31T03:02:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"caf8ce3e0b052d67c56620de459f1a27ba6f874f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFixed two small typos in the latest migration guide\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5695\">#5695</a>: Upgrade Fabric8 Kubernetes Model to Kubernetes v1.30.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: Breaking changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5947\">#5947</a>: CRD generation using the v1beta1 version is deprecated. Please use only v1 instead.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5960\">#5960</a>: The KubernetesSerializer will now by default serialize time related types to strings - rather than object, integer, number, or arrays of integer / number. If you are using these types in a custom object and were not including JsonFormat annotations to adjust the serialization they were likely being serialized in a non-standard way that would not be usable other Kubernetes clients, nor match the generated custom resource definition if one was being produced.

Improvements\r\n\r\nImplemented a way to limit on the number of query controller tasks running at the same time. This limit specifies what percentage or amount of task slots can be allocated to query controllers. If the limit is reached, the tasks would wait for resources instead of potentially blocking the execution of other tasks (and failing after a timeout).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n There is no mechanism in Druid to prevent the cluster from being overloaded with controller tasks. Currently, it could cause a significant slowdown in processing and may lead to temporary deadlock situations.\r\n\r\n### Introduced new configuration options\r\n\r\n* `druid.indexer.queue.controllerTaskSlotRatio` - optional value which defines the proportion of available task slots that can be allocated to msq controller tasks. This is a floating-point value between 0 and 1. Defaults to null.\r\n* `druid.indexer.queue.maxControllerTaskSlots` - optional value which specifies the maximum number of task slots that can be allocated to controller tasks. This is an integer value that provides a hard limit on the number of task slots available for msq controller tasks. Defaults to null.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-13T07:34:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T00:20:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20fd98fbaec921bed09d69b59f7fcad5ae406126","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cryptoe","id":2260045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2260045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe","html_url":"https://github.com/cryptoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kfaraz","id":18635897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM1ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18635897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz","html_url":"https://github.com/kfaraz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kfaraz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nRecent refactors to MSQ introduced a sanity check to verify that the query ID received by the worker during its communication with the controller is correct. However, there was a pre-existing bug in Druid where the query ids for each individual stage can be populated with random UUIDs instead of the correct value. Upgrade/Downgrade between any version till or before Druid 30 where the newer version runs a worker task, while the older version runs a controller task can fail. This PR removes that verification check till its safe to add it back.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #12726\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5695\">#5695</a>: Upgrade Fabric8 Kubernetes Model to Kubernetes v1.30.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: Breaking changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5947\">#5947</a>: CRD generation using the v1beta1 version is deprecated. Please use only v1 instead.</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/issues/5960\">#5960</a>: The KubernetesSerializer will now by default serialize time related types to strings - rather than object, integer, number, or arrays of integer / number.

metricSpec, dimensionSpec, transform (of the TransformSpec), flattenSpec, timestampSpec, then it will not be read for Parquet data files. Since the columns are not read, the filter will end up not matching any rows.

Issue \r\nParent issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\nFixes a bug in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16676. \r\nSchema from cold segments wasn't getting reflected in the datasource schema.\r\nThe problem turned out to be in the refresh thread, it ran only once instead of running periodically. \r\n\r\nThis PR also adds some metrics to monitor cold schema refresh process. \r\n\r\n### Testing \r\n1. Added unit test\r\n2. Verified in a Druid cluster that, \r\n   - Completely cold datasource is queryable. Refer to `cold` datasource in the attached screen shot with 1 segment. \r\n   \r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-09 at 5 40 33 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca6721f7-1bd5-4684-8d57-829746f86bba)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-09 at 5 39 39 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0249aab7-98b3-488a-a0d7-29748453745c)\r\n\r\n   - Datasource schema for partially cold datasource includes columns from cold segments. Refer to `partially_cold` datasource in the attached screen shot with 2 segments. The hot segment has columns c3, c4, c5 and cold segment has columns c1, c2, c3.  \r\n   \r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-09 at 5 40 05 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eae723c0-e1ab-489b-a91f-8f72fee5561d)\r\n\r\n   - Schema for new cold segments created after enabling the CentralizedDatasourceSchema feature is included in datasource schema. \r\n   - Entirely cold datasources which existed before enabling CentralizedDatasourceSchema will not be queryable until at least 1 segment is loaded after enabling the feature. The datasource remains queryable even if the segment is unloaded.  \r\n\r\n### Release Notes \r\n\r\nAdded followings metrics to monitor cold schema refresh process. \r\n```\r\nmetadatacache/cold/segment/count -> Number of cold segment per datasource. \r\nmetadatacache/cold/refresh/count -> Number of cold segments with cached schema per datasource. \r\nmetadatacache/cold/process/time -> Time taken in milliseconds to process cold segments. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ]

\r\n\r\nHowever the filter `t2.countryName in ('Japan', 'Peru')` doesn't hold true for the second row that is returned. This happens because the filter on the RHS is rewritten to a filter on the LHS, which matches for both rows. The join returns `(Peru, null, null, null)` for the second row since that row doesn't join because of `(t1.code = t2.code)`. However, the rewritten filter is lost and we return an answer for which the filter doesn't hold.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nPreviously the Druid schema resolution did not allow for the blending of schemas of those provided by the schema manager, and that computed through the segment metadata cache. Also, previously, the schema manager was preferred over the native Druid catalog when resolving table schemas. This pr fixes these issues, but allowing for the proper blending of schemas provided by the schema manager and that computed through the segment metadata cache. And we now prefer a table schema found in the native Druid catalog to that found in the schema manager.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR is inspired by my comment in another PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16819#pullrequestreview-2213300179 . Basically I made that comment and I realized it is not 100% true that `mandatoryQueryContext` does that @lorem--ipsum tried to do. I instead added `baseQueryContext` that I believe works as expected and also added a configurable `serverQueryContext` which is my implementation of the `clusterDefaultContext` I suggested in the comment.\r\n\r\nI believe this PR fully obviates the need for 16819\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a bug where SQL data loader crashes on

Description\r\n\r\nIn the native engine, a user can specify values for `createBitmapIndex` and `multiValueHandling` properties for `string` dimensions to override the defaults. In MSQ, however, there is currently no provision to pass these details for strings; the default values for the type are always used instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for passing in a custom `DimensionSchema` map to MSQ query destination of type `DataSourceMSQDestination`. The current consumer of this functionality is a compaction job which needs to preserve the schema of the segments being compacted.  With this change, compaction tasks can retain only the `createBitmapIndex` property of the input segments, but not `multiValueHandling` property since that info is not persisted anywhere in the segment.\r\n\r\nMain classes to review:\r\n* `DataSourceMSQDestination`\r\n* `ControllerImpl`\r\n* `MSQCompactionRunner`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

benchmarks are not present in this PR, i've done some pretty heavy refactoring of the sql benchmarks so will add them in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* Adds new `CompressedComplexColumn`, `CompressedComplexColumnSerializer`, `CompressedComplexColumnSupplier` based on `CompressedVariableSizedBlobColumn` used by JSON columns\r\n* Adds `IndexSpec.complexMetricCompression` which can be used to specify compression for the generic compressed complex column. Defaults to uncompressed because compressed columns are not backwards compatible.\r\n* Adds new definition of `ComplexMetricSerde.getSerializer` which accepts an `IndexSpec` argument when creating a serializer. The old signature has been marked `@Deprecated` and has a default implementation that returns `null`, but it will be used by the default implementation of the new version if it is implemented to return a non-null value. The default implementation of the new method will use a `CompressedComplexColumnSerializer` if `IndexSpec.complexMetricCompression` is not null/none/uncompressed, or will use `LargeColumnSupportedComplexColumnSerializer` otherwise.\r\n* Removed all duplicate generic implementations of `ComplexMetricSerde.getSerializer` and `ComplexMetricSerde.deserializeColumn` into default implementations `ComplexMetricSerde` instead of being copied all over the place. The default implementation of `deserializeColumn` will check if the first byte indicates that the new compression was used, otherwise will use the `GenericIndexed` based supplier.\r\n* Complex columns with custom serializers/deserializers are unaffected and may continue doing whatever it is they do, either with specialized compression or whatever else, this new stuff is just to provide generic implementations built around `ObjectStrategy`. This should not preclude further specializing specific complex types in the future, this is just providing a generic base way to have compression to save some space.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nCompression is now available for all \"complex\" metric columns which do not have specialized implementations through a new `IndexSpec` option, `complexMetricCompression`, which defaults to uncompressed for backwards compatibility, but can be configured to any compression strategy (lz4, zstd, etc). This works for most complex columns except for compressed-big-decimal, and the columns stored by first/last aggregators.\r\n\r\nNote that enabling compression is _not_ backwards compatible with Druid versions older than 31, so only enable this functionality once certain there is no need to roll-back to an older Druid version.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

`IndexedStringDruidPredicateIndexes` to just use a counter for index position since we are just iterating the dictionary. I have no idea why the code is like this since all of the other predicate index implementations were doing the sane thing already (though I've simplified them a bit in this PR since they were needlessly keeping separate position and matching position counters), perhaps there was a gas leak when I wrote the string one.\r\n\r\nI haven't measured it, but I assume this should be a large performance improvement for string predicate indexes since we don't have to binary search every matching value in the dictionary 🤦

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, MSQ queries like the following failed with a NPE:\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"test_1\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT\r\n  \"__time\",\r\n  \"countryName\",\r\n  ROW_NUMBER() over (PARTITION BY countryName) as c1\r\nFROM \"wikipedia\"\r\nwhere countryName='Guatemala'\r\nPARTITIONED BY DAY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause was that the shuffle spec of the final window stage was being hardcoded to MixShuffleSpec, hence it wasn't taking the required segment granularity into account. This PR changes the logic to use the `resultShuffleSpecFactory` for the last window stage.\r\n\r\nAlong with the above, we also need to add virtual columns like `__bucket` to the frame writer in `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor`. This PR makes this change as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a test which fails with NPE without the changes of this PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, segments are always sorted by `__time`, followed by the sort order provided by the user via `dimensionsSpec` or `CLUSTERED BY`. Sorting by `__time` enables efficient execution of queries involving time-ordering or granularity. Time-ordering is a simple matter of reading the rows in stored order, and granular cursors can be generated in streaming fashion.\r\n\r\nHowever, for various workloads, it's better for storage footprint and query performance to sort by arbitrary orders that do not start with `__time`. With this patch, users can sort segments by such orders.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nFor spec-based ingestion, users add `forceSegmentSortByTime: false` to dimensionsSpec. The `dimensions` list determines the sort order. To define a sort order that includes `__time`, users explicitly include a dimension named `__time`.\r\n\r\nFor SQL-based ingestion, users set the context parameter `forceSegmentSortByTime: false`. The CLUSTERED BY clause is then used as the explicit segment sort order.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, when the new `forceSegmentSortByTime` parameter is `true` (the default), `__time` is implicitly prepended to the sort order, as it always was prior to this patch.\r\n\r\nThe new parameter is experimental for two main reasons. First, such segments can cause errors when loaded by older servers, due to violating their expectations that timestamps are always monotonically increasing. Second, even on newer servers, not all queries can run on non-time-sorted segments. Scan queries involving time-ordering and any query involving granularity will not run. (To partially mitigate this, a currently-undocumented SQL feature `sqlUseGranularity` is provided. When set to false the SQL planner avoids using `granularity`.)\r\n\r\n## Main changes\r\n\r\nChanges on the write path:\r\n\r\n1) `DimensionsSpec` can now optionally contain a `__time` dimension, which controls the placement of `__time` in the sort order. If not present, `__time` is considered to be first in the sort order, as it has always been.\r\n\r\n2) `IncrementalIndex` and `IndexMerger` are updated to sort facts more flexibly; not always by time first.\r\n\r\n3) `Metadata` (stored in metadata.drd) gains a `sortOrder` field.\r\n\r\n4) MSQ can generate range-based shard specs even when not all columns are singly-valued strings. It merely stops accepting new clustering key fields when it encounters the first one that isn't a singly-valued string. This is useful because it enables range shard specs on `someDim` to be created for clauses like `CLUSTERED BY someDim, __time`.\r\n\r\n5) Auto-compaction respects and propagates sort orders that don't start with `__time`.\r\n\r\nChanges on the read path:\r\n\r\n1) Update cursor holders for `QueryableIndex` and `IncrementalIndex` to return the ordering of the underlying index, so query engines can tell how a segment is sorted.\r\n\r\n2) Update `CursorGranularizer` and `VectorCursorGranularizer` to throw errors when using granularities on non-time-ordered segments.\r\n\r\n3) Update `ScanQueryEngine` to throw an error when using the time-ordering `order` parameter on non-time-ordered segments.\r\n\r\n4) Update `TimeBoundaryQueryRunnerFactory` to perform a segment scan when running on a non-time-ordered segment.\r\n\r\n5) Add `sqlUseGranularity` context parameter that causes the SQL planner to avoid using granularities other than ALL. This is undocumented, because it's hopefully a short-term hack. The more ideal thing would be to have all the native queries work properly on these segments.\r\n\r\n6) Move `getMinTime`, `getMaxTime`, and `getMaxIngestedEventTime` from `StorageAdapter` to `TimeBoundaryInspector` and `MaxIngestedEventTimeInspector`. This is mainly necessary for `timeBoundary` queries to be able to tell whether they can use `getMinTime` and `getMaxTime`, vs. needing to use a cursor. Previously, `timeBoundary` assumed that an adapter backing a `TableDataSource` was guaranteed to have an exact `getMinTime` and `getMaxTime`. But after this patch, that isn't necessarily going to be the case (in particular: a non-time-sorted segment won't be able to know its exact min/max time without a full scan.)\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n1) Rename `DimensionsSpec#hasCustomDimensions` to `hasFixedDimensions` and change the meaning subtly: it now returns true if the `DimensionsSpec` represents an unchanging list of dimensions, or false if there is some discovery happening. This is what call sites had expected anyway.\r\n\r\n2) Removed `descending` from `Joinable#makeJoinMatcher`. Now that `descending` has more or less been phased out in favor of `ordering: [__time DESC]`, the joinable order no longer needs to be reversed. (All joined rows arising from the same left-hand row have the same value.)","created_at":"2024-08-06T21:18:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T17:35:52Z","closed_at":"2024-08-23T15:24:44Z","merged_at":"2024-08-23T15:24:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"0603d5153d8177856687c957ae0061492c81e1d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes  #16446\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

This synchronises the value across all running threads\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ... \r\n#16727\r\n[addDiscoveredTaskToPendingCompletionTaskGroups](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/954aaafe0c85c1f4967bdb5798c17d4dc813ddd4/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/seekablestream/supervisor/SeekableStreamSupervisor.java#L2485) is not properly Thread Synchronized and updates to it are made on the basis of a stale copy of reads. When we submit supervisor config, there are cases  where instead of adding all tasks in same TaskGroup, it can create Multiple copies of TaskGroups. For ex, if A1,A2 are consuming from same partition and are in same group, then\r\n```\r\nideal_behavior: pendingCompletionTaskGroup[P] = { TaskGroup{A1,A2}  }\r\nbehavior_seen: pendingCompletionTaskGroup[P] = { TaskGroup{A1}, TaskGroup{A2} }\r\n```\r\nThis is because, while initialising a new TaskGroup, the threads rely on a stale copy of read and multiple threads executing simultaneously, adding tasks to pendingCompletionTaskGroup can create new task groups instead of being added to existing ones. This behaviour defeats the purpose of Task replication as these single task taskgroup if gets failed for some reason, than Overlord sees it as entire task group is failed, and kill actively reading tasks too, to resume ingestion from last published segment.\r\n\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\nAdds a configuration `clientConnectTimeout` to our http client config which controls the connection timeout for our http client requests.\r\n\r\nIt was observed that on busy K8S clusters, the default connect timeout of 500ms is sometimes not enough time to complete syn/acks for a request and in these cases, the requests timeout with the error: \r\n`exceptionType=java.net.SocketTimeoutException, exceptionMessage=Connect Timeout` \r\nThis behavior was mostly observed on the router while forwarding queries to the broker.\r\nHaving a slightly higher connect timeout helped resolve these issues.\r\n\r\n####Release Note:\r\nAdds http client config `clientConnectTimeout` to configure connection timeouts for Druid http client requests. \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] been

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes queries like \r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT json_col) FROM foo\r\n```\r\nwhen run using MSQ.\r\n\r\nThe frames delegate the `classOfObject` to `ComplexMetricSerde.getExtractor()` which isn't implemented for JSON columns and is probably not the right way to fetch the class of the complex type. A better alternative is to use the object type strategy to fetch the class, which is implemented for every complex serde. This PR modifies the field reader and the column readers to use the latter method. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we have a query with window function having `PARTITION BY xyz`, and we have a million unique values for `xyz` each having 1 row, we'd end up creating a million individual RACs for processing, each having a single row. This is unnecessary, and we can batch the PARTITION BY keys together for processing, and process them only when we can't batch further rows to adhere to `maxRowsMaterialized` config.\r\n\r\nThe previous iteration of this PR was simplifying `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor` to run all operators on all the rows instead of creating smaller RACs per `partition by` key. That approach was discarded in favor of the batching approach, and the details are summarized here: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16823#issuecomment-2292772397.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `WindowOperatorQueryFrameProcessor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Problem\r\nCurrently, the default value for the `MultiValueHandling` enum is hardcoded as `SORTED_ARRAY`. The MVD info isn't stored in the segment. The multi-value handling only applies to classic string dimension handler; all other types ignore it by design as we want users to use real array types as MVDs .\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this means that if a classic string dimension is ingested with `multiValueHandling` set to `SORTED_SET` or `ARRAY`, [compaction](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/task/CompactionTask.java#L963) will use the [default](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/column/CapabilitiesBasedFormat.java#L83) and rewrite it as `SORTED_ARRAY`. This is a bug that's been around for awhile now.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces an optional cluster configuration, `druid.indexing.formats.stringMultiValueHandlingMode`, allowing users to set the mode to one of `SORTED_SET`, `SORTED_ARRAY`, or `ARRAY` (`SORTED_SET` is the default). Case insensitive values are allowed. \r\n\r\nThis setting is particularly beneficial for users who are unable to migrate to proper array types yet. Can be used in the context of MSQ-based compaction as well.\r\n\r\nMain classes to review:\r\n- `BuiltInTypesModule `\r\n- `DimensionSchema`\r\n-  `BuiltInTypesModuleTest`\r\n\r\nAll the other changes are mostly the result of a renaming change from `NestedDataModule` to `BuiltInTypesModule`.\r\n\r\nI will add docs for this property in a follow up PR along with other docs changes.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces an optional cluster configuration, `druid.indexing.formats.stringMultiValueHandlingMode`, allowing operators to override the default mode `SORTED_SET` for string dimensions. The possible values for the config are `SORTED_SET`, `SORTED_ARRAY`, or `ARRAY` (`SORTED_SET` is the default). Case insensitive values are allowed. \r\nWhile this cluster property allows users to manage the multi-value handling mode for string dimension types, it's recommended to migrate to using real array types instead of MVDs. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been

Updated error response to hide error stack in case of JsonMappingException if `druid.server.http.showDetailedJsonMappingError` is configured as `false`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently when Jackson failed to map request payload either due to required fields or invalid types, it end up exposing too much details about the internal model with 400 response. This can be concerning from security point of view.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that an attacker may be able to exploit this indeterminate state to access unauthorized functionality, or worse, create, modify or destroy data. Error messages may also aid in the identification of other attacks such as buffer overflows and SQL injection, and can generally contribute to an overall weaker security posture. \r\n\r\nThe same physical paths, versioning information, stack traces' content, and other data can be gathered and used to help further an attack. \r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug \r\nAdded flag `druid.server.http.showDetailedJsonMappingError` similar `druid.server.http.showDetailedJettyError` to configure error message detail.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Background\r\n\r\nZK-based segment loading has been completely disabled in #15705 .\r\nZK `servedSegmentsPath` has been deprecated since Druid 0.7.1, #1182 .\r\nThis legacy path has been replaced by the `liveSegmentsPath` and is not used in the code anymore.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Never create ZK loadQueuePath as it is never used.\r\n- Never create ZK servedSegmentsPath as it is never used.\r\n- Do not create ZK liveSegmentsPath if announcement on ZK is disabled\r\n- Fix up tests\r\n\r\n### Upgrade considerations\r\n\r\nSince ZK loadQueuePath will not be created any more by a server, there can be failures while loading\r\na segment during a rolling upgrade from Druid 29 (or older) to Druid 31.\r\nThese failures will happen only if using ZK-based segment loading. A coordinator on an older version\r\nwould try to create a ZK node to indicate to a server to load a segment. But the root path would not\r\nexist since (being on a new version) the server would not have created the ZK path at all.\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\n1. ZK-based segment loading has been disabled in Druid 30, #15705.\r\nIn Druid 31, segment serving processes such as Peons, Historicals and Indexers will not create ZK loadQueuePath\r\nanymore. The property `druid.zk.paths.loadQueuePath` will be ignored and should not be specified anymore.\r\n\r\n__When upgrading to Druid 31, the recommended approach is to first move to HTTP-based segment loading\r\nand then perform the version upgrade.__\r\n\r\n2. The property `druid.zk.paths.servedSegmentsPath` is not used anymore and is being removed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new Kinesis aware InputFormat. and reader to read and parse Kinesis records. The reader relies on a `ByteEntity` type, `KinesisRecordEntity` which includes the underlying kinesis record. This allows the reader to read kinesis produced header values, like the approximate time that the kinesis server received the record, and the partitionKey. The input reader and format at this time only supports reading and parsing the record data, approximate time, and partitionKey,  but can be easily extended to support reading other header values. This implementation follows the existing `KafkaInputFormat` implementation closely.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe following fields have been deprecated since #8141 , Druid 0.16.0.\r\n- `maxRowsPerSegment`\r\n- `numShards`\r\n- `maxTotalRows`\r\n\r\nInstead of these fields, users can explicitly specify the desired `partitionsSpec`.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Remove deprecated fields from batch task tuning configs.\r\n - `IndexTuningConfig` used in `index` tasks\r\n  - `ParallelIndexTuningConfig` used in `index_parallel` tasks\r\n  - `CompactionTuningConfig` used in `compact` tasks\r\n  - `DataSourceCompactionConfig` used by auto-compaction duty\r\n- Streaming tasks tuning configs need not change as they always use `dynamic` partitioning\r\nand it suffices to just specify the `maxRowsPerSegment`.\r\n- Remove `publishTimeout` as it is just an alias for `pushTimeout`\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nThe following deprecated fields are being removed from all batch task tuning configs:\r\n- `maxRowsPerSegment`\r\n- `numShards`\r\n- `maxTotalRows`\r\n-

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional query param `detail` to `/v2/sql/statements/query-id` endpoint.\r\n\r\nAs per offline discussion with @vogievetsky, the PR adds 3 additional fields to the API response when `detail=true` is passed:\r\n1. `stages`: Stages for the query from MSQ task report\r\n2. `counters`: Stage counters for the query from MSQ task report\r\n3. `warnings`: Warning reports for the query from MSQ task report\r\n\r\nThis is to allow us to have a single API that returns the status and task report for MSQ queries.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Sample API response

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes query correctness issues for MSQ window functions when using more than 1 worker (that is, `maxNumTasks > 2`).\r\n\r\nCurrently, we were keeping the shuffle spec of the previous stage when we didn't have any partition columns for window stage. This PR changes it to override the shuffle spec of the previous stage to MixShuffleSpec (if we have a window function with empty over clause) so that the window stage gets a single partition to work on.\r\n\r\nA test has been added for a query which returned incorrect results prior to this change when using more than 1 workers.\r\n\r\n### Sample Query\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect countryName, cityName, channel, \r\nrow_number() over (order by countryName, cityName, channel) as c1,\r\ncount(channel) over (partition by cityName order by countryName, cityName, channel) as c2\r\nfrom \"wikipedia\"\r\nwhere countryName in ('Austria', 'Republic of Korea')\r\ngroup by countryName, cityName, channel \r\norder by countryName, cityName, channel\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the above query gives incorrect results with maxNumTasks=5 as can be seen in the following screenshot.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"742\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b163bf-1032-4f54-8f24-8b7a4961f1b1\">\r\n\r\nWith this PR's changes, the above query gives correct results, as can be seen in the added test.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Changes\r\n\r\n- Add API `/druid/coordinator/v1/config/compaction/cluster` to update cluster level compaction config\r\n- Add class `CompactionConfigUpdateRequest`\r\n- Fix bug in `CoordinatorCompactionConfig` which caused compaction engine to not be persisted.\r\nUse json field name `engine` instead of `compactionEngine` because JSON field names must align\r\nwith the getter name.\r\n- Update MSQ validation error messages\r\n- Complete overhaul of `CoordinatorCompactionConfigResourceTest` to remove unnecessary mocking\r\nand add more meaningful tests.\r\n- Add `TuningConfigBuilder` to easily build tuning configs for tests.\r\n- Add `DatasourceCompactionConfigBuilder`\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n(Some of the details mentioned below are in a follow up PR #16810)\r\n\r\nAdd API to update cluster-level compaction dynamic config\r\n\r\nPath: `/druid/coordinator/v1/config/compaction/cluster`\r\nMethod: POST\r\nSample Payload:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n     \"compactionTaskSlotRatio\": 0.5,\r\n     \"maxCompactionTaskSlots\": 10,\r\n     \"engine\": \"msq\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis API deprecates the older API `/druid/coordinator/v1/config/compaction/taskslots`.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

So this commit checks for such cases and provide an actionable error msg to use a different syntax.\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\nrow_number() over w as c\r\nFROM table\r\nWINDOW w as (partition by aggr(col1) order by col2)\r\n```\r\nwould not work. Where as \r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\nrow_number() over (partition by aggr(col1) order by col2) as c\r\nFROM table\r\n```\r\nworks fine.\r\n\r\nThis check is to be removed once CALCITE-6500 is fixed\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds implementation for `resultsAsFrames` to the window tool chest. This will allow the subqueries involving window functions to be limited by `maxSubqueryBytes`, which is a better alternative to the `maxSubqueryRows` for limiting the heap usage of a query.  \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nWindow queries now acknowledge `maxSubqueryBytes`. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
