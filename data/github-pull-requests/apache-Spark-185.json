for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31357\r\n\r\n#31357 added a very strong restriction to the vectorized parquet reader, that the spark data type must exactly match the physical parquet type, when reading decimal fields. This restriction is actually not necessary, as we can safely read parquet decimals with a larger precision. This PR releases this restriction a little bit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo not fail queries unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users can read parquet decimals with mismatched `DecimalType` as long as the scale is the same and precision is larger.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the type mapping for `money` and `money[]`  types for PostgreSQL.\r\nCurrently, those types are tried to convert to `DoubleType` and `ArrayType` of `double` respectively.\r\nBut the JDBC driver seems not to be able to handle those types properly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/100\r\nhttps://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/1405\r\n\r\nDue to these issue, we can get the error like as follows.\r\n\r\nmoney type.\r\n```\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0) (192.168.1.204 executor driver): org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Bad value for type double : 1,000.00\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.PgResultSet.toDouble(PgResultSet.java:3104)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.PgResultSet.getDouble(PgResultSet.java:2432)\r\n[info] \tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$makeGetter$5(JdbcUtils.scala:418)\r\n```\r\n\r\nmoney[] type.\r\n```\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0) (192.168.1.204 executor driver): org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Bad value for type double : $2,000.00\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.PgResultSet.toDouble(PgResultSet.java:3104)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.ArrayDecoding$5.parseValue(ArrayDecoding.java:235)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.ArrayDecoding$AbstractObjectStringArrayDecoder.populateFromString(ArrayDecoding.java:122)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.ArrayDecoding.readStringArray(ArrayDecoding.java:764)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.PgArray.buildArray(PgArray.java:310)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.PgArray.getArrayImpl(PgArray.java:171)\r\n[info] \tat org.postgresql.jdbc.PgArray.getArray(PgArray.java:111)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor money type, a known workaround is to treat it as string so this PR do it.\r\nFor money[], however, there is no reasonable workaround so this PR remove the support.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. As of this PR merged, money type is mapped to `StringType` rather than `DoubleType` and the support for money[] is stopped.\r\nFor money type, if the value is less than one thousand,  `$100.00` for instance, it works without this change so I also updated the migration guide because it's a behavior change for such small values.\r\nOn the other hand, money[] seems not to work with any value but mentioned in the migration guide just in case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28027\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28027 added a DS v2 API that allows data sources to produce metadata/hidden columns that can only be seen when it's explicitly selected. The way we integrate this API into Spark is:\r\n1. The v2 relation gets normal output and metadata output from the data source, and the metadata output is excluded from the plan output by default.\r\n2. column resolution can resolve `UnresolvedAttribute` with metadata columns, even if the child plan doesn't output metadata columns.\r\n3. An analyzer rule searches the query plan, trying to find a node that has missing inputs. If such node is found, transform the sub-plan of this node, and update the v2 relation to include the metadata output.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer rule in step 3 brings a perf regression, for queries that do not read v2 tables at all. This rule will calculate `QueryPlan.inputSet` (which builds an `AttributeSet` from outputs of all children) and `QueryPlan.missingInput` (which does a set exclusion and creates a new `AttributeSet`) for every plan node in the query plan. In our benchmark, the TPCDS query compilation time gets increased by more than 10%\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a simple way to improve it: we add a special metadata entry to the metadata attribute, which allows us to quickly check if a plan needs to add metadata columns: we just check all the references of this plan, and see if the attribute contains the special metadata entry, instead of calculating `QueryPlan.missingInput`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes one bug: we should not change the final output schema of the plan, if we only use metadata columns in operators like filter, sort, etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix perf regression in SQL query compilation, and fix a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith `yarn-client` mode, our user meet case that because yarn queue's setting, some app's container is preempted by a higher level request due to the scheduling framework. Then throw `ApplicationAttemptNotFoundException`,  in an old PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10129, it add the behavior we always close app directly without retry when hit `ApplicationAttemptNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\nIn yarn-client mode, when AM's container was preempted. Then RM can't find this attempt. Then client driver backend receive `ApplicationAttemptNotFoundException`. But for some case, such as queue issue caused by peak usage, we can have a retry then it may success. \r\n\r\nSince for not all case throw `ApplicationAttemptNotFoundException` we don't need to retry. IMO, we should not just catch this exception and stop app. So in this pr, I suppose to add a condition, that only when cluster mode, we just stop when hit \r\n`ApplicationAttemptNotFoundException`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake job more tolerable about container issue\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNot

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to remove `TRUNCATE` from the default `capabilities` list from `FileTable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe abstract class `FileTable` now lists `TRUNCATE` in its `capabilities`, but `FileTable` does not know if an implementation really supports truncation or not. Specifically, we can check existing `FileTable` implementations including `AvroTable`, `CSVTable`, `JsonTable`, etc. No one implementation really implements `SupportsTruncate` in its writer builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, because seems to me `FileTable` is not of user-facing public API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor a view, there might be several underlying tables.\r\n\r\nIn long-running spark server use case, such as zeppelin, kyuubi, livy.\r\n\r\nIf a table updated, we need refresh this table in current long running spark session.\r\n\r\nBut if the table is a view, we need refresh the underlying tables one by one.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, when refreshing a view,  we also refresh its underlying tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is user-friendly for long-running spark server case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, with this pr, user need not refresh the underlying tables of a non-temporary view.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCreate new file index after partition schema inferring, and use the inferred partition schema in it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug demonstrated by the example:\r\n1. There are partitioned parquet files (file format doesn't matter):\r\n```\r\n/private/var/folders/p3/dfs6mf655d7fnjrsjvldh0tc0000gn/T/spark-e09eae99-7ecf-4ab2-b99b-f63f8dea658d\r\n├── _SUCCESS\r\n├── part=-0\r\n│   └── part-00001-02144398-2896-4d21-9628-a8743d098cb4.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n└── part=AA\r\n    └── part-00000-02144398-2896-4d21-9628-a8743d098cb4.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n```\r\nplaced to two partitions \"AA\" and **\"-0\"**.\r\n\r\n2. When reading them w/o specified schema:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.parquet(path)\r\ndf.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- id: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- part: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\nthe inferred type of the partition column `part` is the **string** type.\r\n3. The expected values in the column `part` are \"AA\" and \"-0\" but we get:\r\n```\r\ndf.show(false)\r\n+---+----+\r\n|id |part|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|0  |AA  |\r\n|1  |0   |\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\nSo, Spark returns **\"0\"** instead of **\"-0\"**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis PR can change query results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test and existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `ALTER TABLE ... SET/UNSET TBLPROPERTIES` to use `UnresolvedTable` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: [SPARK-29900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, `ALTER TABLE SET/UNSET TBLPROPERTIES` will have a consistent resolution behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that `PostgresDialect` can't treat arrays of some types.\r\nThough PostgreSQL supports wide range of types (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/datatype.html),  the current `PostgresDialect` can't treat arrays of the following types.\r\n\r\n* xml\r\n* tsvector\r\n* tsquery\r\n* macaddr\r\n* macaddr8\r\n* txid_snapshot\r\n* pg_snapshot\r\n* point\r\n* line\r\n* lseg\r\n* box\r\n* path\r\n* polygon\r\n* circle\r\n* pg_lsn\r\n* bit varying\r\n* interval\r\n\r\nNOTE: PostgreSQL doesn't implement arrays of serial types so this PR doesn't care about them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo provide better support with PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. PostgresDialect can handle arrays of types shown above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2021-02-01T13:44:38Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T02:29:33Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T02:29:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1199629f468c1de9722fefbfa9be488b707ef72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/010413ee49728b5ed537636aef520f024e12ec09","head":{"label":"sarutak:postgres-array-types","ref":"postgres-array-types","sha":"010413ee49728b5ed537636aef520f024e12ec09","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs a followup from discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29804#discussion_r493100510 . Currently in data source v1 file scan `FileSourceScanExec`, [bucket filter pruning will only take effect with bucket table scan](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L542 ). However this is unnecessary, as bucket filter pruning can also happen if we disable bucketed table scan. Read files with bucket hash partitioning, and bucket filter pruning are two orthogonal features, and do not need to couple together.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis help query leverage the benefit from bucket filter pruning to save CPU/IO to not read unnecessary bucket files, and do not bound by bucket table scan when the parallelism of tasks is a concern.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this also resolves the issue to reduce number of tasks launched for simple query with bucket column filter - SPARK-33207, because with bucket scan, we launch # of tasks to equal to # of buckets, and this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `BucketedReadSuite.scala` to make all existing unit tests for bucket filter work with this PR.","created_at":"2021-02-01T06:27:44Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T13:31:51Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T13:00:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa4ca3d313bbc6fe1dd3e135839d6a024490c8ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03120af6b31af89dbc9fb9aad05045e98d52c699","head":{"label":"c21:bucket-pruning","ref":"bucket-pruning","sha":"03120af6b31af89dbc9fb9aad05045e98d52c699","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSimilar to SPARK-33690, this PR improves the output layout of `printSchema` for the case column names contain meta characters.\r\nHere is an example.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nscala> val df1 = spark.sql(\"SELECT 'aaa\\nbbb\\tccc\\rddd\\feee\\bfff\\u000Bggg\\^Ghhh'\")\r\nscala> df1.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- aaa\r\nddd\tccc\r\n   eefff\r\n        ggghhh: string (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nscala> df1.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- aaa\\nbbb\\tccc\\rddd\\feee\\bfff\\vggg\\ahhh: string (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid breaking the layout of `Dataset#printSchema`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2021-02-01T06:27:06Z","updated_at":"2021-02-03T02:07:31Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T02:07:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b739ec155cd6ea9489e8e124a2d4de5c4a00449","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bbab0156997975e5af90db4079a7c99b383b5b6a","head":{"label":"sarutak:escape-meta-printSchema","ref":"escape-meta-printSchema","sha":"bbab0156997975e5af90db4079a7c99b383b5b6a","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

DROP PARTITION` in V2 table catalog used in tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a bug fix. Before the fix, `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` does not remove the data belongs to the dropped partition. As a consequence of that, the `select` query returns removed data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR completes snake_case rule at functions APIs across the languages, see also SPARK-10621.\r\n\r\nIn more details, this PR:\r\n- Adds `count_distinct` in Scala Python, and R, and document that `count_distinct` is encouraged. This was not deprecated because `countDistinct` is pretty commonly used. We could deprecate in the future releases.\r\n- (Scala-specific) adds `typedlit` but doesn't deprecate `typedLit` which is arguably commonly used. Likewise, we could deprecate in the future releases.\r\n- Deprecates and renames:\r\n  - `sumDistinct` -> `sum_distinct`\r\n  - `bitwiseNOT` -> `bitwise_not`\r\n  - `shiftLeft` -> `shiftleft` (matched with SQL name in `FunctionRegistry`)\r\n  - `shiftRight` -> `shiftright` (matched with SQL name in `FunctionRegistry`)\r\n  - `shiftRightUnsigned` -> `shiftrightunsigned` (matched with SQL name in `FunctionRegistry`)\r\n  - (Scala-specific) `callUDF` -> `call_udf`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the consistent naming in APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it deprecates some APIs and add new renamed APIs as described above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove the check `verifyAlterTableType()` from the following v1 commands:\r\n- AlterTableAddPartitionCommand\r\n- AlterTableDropPartitionCommand\r\n- AlterTableRenamePartitionCommand\r\n- AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommand\r\n- AlterTableSerDePropertiesCommand\r\n- AlterTableSetLocationCommand\r\n\r\nThe check is not needed any more after migration on new resolution framework, see SPARK-29900.\r\n\r\nAlso new tests were added to:\r\n- AlterTableAddPartitionSuiteBase\r\n- AlterTableDropPartitionSuiteBase\r\n- AlterTableRenamePartitionSuiteBase\r\n- v1/AlterTableRecoverPartitionsSuite\r\n\r\nand removed duplicate tests from `SQLViewSuite` and `HiveDDLSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe tests for `AlterTableSerDePropertiesCommand`/`AlterTableSetLocationCommand` exist in SQLViewSuite` and `HiveDDLSuite`, and they can be ported to unified tests after SPARK-34305 and SPARK-34332.\r\n\r\nThe `ALTER TABLE .. CHANGE COLUMN` command accepts only tables too, so, the check can be removed after migration on new resolution framework, SPARK-34302.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance by removing dead code. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Added new tests to unified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableAddPartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableDropPartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableRenamePartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableRecoverPartitionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n2. Run the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *SQLViewSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *HiveDDLSuite\"\r\n```

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using 'Dataset.union.distinct.union.distinct', the operator is  'Deduplicate(Keys, Union)', but AstBuilder transform sql-style 'Union' to operator 'Distinct(Union)', the rule 'CombineUnions' in Optimizer only handle 'Distinct(Union)' operator but not Deduplicate(Keys, Union).\r\nPlease see the detailed  description in [SPARK-34283](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34283).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Added  `isSpecialTimestamp`  and `isSpecialDate` functions to `DatetimeUtils` so that we can determine if a string matches one of the shorthand date(time) notations (`now`, `today` etc). \r\n- Updated PartitioningUtils.inferPartitionColumnValue so that we don't infer date and time values if they match one of the shorthand notations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously, reading a partitioned dataset from file where one of the partition values matches a special date/timestamp (`NOW`, `TODAY` etc) caused the value to be interpreted as a date/timestamp rather than a string. This is incorrect for a number of reasons.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n*  When a user writes a partition column of type string they do not expect to have it read back as type timestamp\r\n*  The majority of these special values are dynamic.  This means that the same data yields different results depending on the time of day it is read etc.  Indeed in certain circumstances (specifically nested partitions) the same parition can end up with multiple distinct values in a given query as its value is evaluated at multiple points in time.\r\n* Even if the the column as a whole is determined to be of type string, the special values are still parsed as timestamps .   This means you have a partitioning scheme where some partitions are being interpreted as strings while others are being interpreted as dates.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that strings matching these shorthands are preserved as strings.    \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes: any file-partitioned datasets possessing a string matching a special date/timestamp  as a partition key will have that value interpreted as a string rather than as a date/timestamp.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider the following program:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\nobject TestBug {\r\n\r\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n    val spark = SparkSession.builder().master(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n    val df = spark.range(1, 2).withColumn(\"partition\", lit(\"NOW\"))\r\n    df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").partitionBy(\"partition\").parquet(\"bug\")\r\n    \r\n    spark.read.parquet(\"bug\").show(truncate = false)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, the output would be be of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+--------------------------+\r\n|id |partition |\r\n+---+--------------------------+\r\n|1 |2021-01-27 08:53:23.650039|\r\n+---+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing this change, the output is of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+---------+\r\n|id |partition|\r\n+---+---------+\r\n|1  |NOW      |\r\n+---+---------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Extended  `column type inference` checks in ParquetPartitionDiscoverySuite to confirm that special date/timestamps where being

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add a couple of metrics in scan node for Kafka batch streaming query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen testing SS, I found it is hard to track data loss of SS reading from Kafka. The micro batch scan node has only one metric, number of output rows. Users have no idea how many offsets to fetch are out of Kafka, how many times data loss happens. These metrics are important for users to know the quality of SS query running.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, adding two metrics to micro batch scan node for Kafka batch streaming.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently I tested on internal cluster with Kafka:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1193\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-22 at 7 16 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68855/115808460-61bf8100-a39f-11eb-99a9-65d22c3f5fb0.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was trying to add unit test. But as our batch streaming query disallows to specify ending offsets. If I only specify an out-of-range starting offset, when we get offset range in `getRanges`,  any negative size range will be filtered out. So it cannot actually test the case of fetched non-existing offset.","created_at":"2021-01-30T08:35:34Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:25:00Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T20:57:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0342c000d7d4a2fe3ce503480455c36a1903e875","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing the flaky `handle large number of containers and tasks (SPARK-18750)` by avoiding to use `DNSToSwitchMapping` as in some situation DNS lookup could be extremely slow. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31363 was merged the flaky `handle large number of containers and tasks (SPARK-18750)` test failed again in some other PRs but now we have the exact place where the test is stuck. \r\n\r\nIt is in the DNS lookup: \r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] - handle large number of containers

wait for the IPv6 query to timeout before falling back to IPv4.\r\n\r\nThis even make the tests more consistent. As when a single host was given to lookup via `resolve(hostName: String)` it gave a different answer from calling `resolve(hostNames: Seq[String])` with a `Seq` containing that single host.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe added test \"built-in Hadoop version should support shaded client\" in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31203, but it fails when profile hadoop-2.7 is activated. This change fixes the test by skipping the assertion when Hadoop version is 2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe test fails in master branch when profile hadoop-2.7 is activated.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the test with hadoop-2.7

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `internal()` from `spark.kubernetes.executor.podNamePrefix` in order to make it the configuration public.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn line with K8s GA, this will allow some users control the full executor pod names officially.\r\nThis is useful when we want a custom executor pod name pattern independently from the app name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this has been there since Apache Spark 2.3.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

If the new API is used (spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=true) casting Instant and LocalDate to Timestamp and Date respectively fails. The proposed change is to handle Instant and LocalDate values and transform them to Timestamp and Date.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen generating SQL queries only the old date time API types are handled for values in org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.JdbcDialect#compileValue. If the new API is used (spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=true) Instant and LocalDate values are not quoted and errors are thrown. The change proposed is to handle Instant and LocalDate values the same way that Timestamp and Date are.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This backport PR comes from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31148#.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to prevent `HeartbeatReceiver` asks `Executor` to re-register blocker manager when the SparkContext is already stopped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `HeartbeatReceiver` blindly asks re-registration for the new heartbeat message.\r\nHowever, when SparkContext is stopped, we don't need to re-register new block manager.\r\nRe-registration causes unnecessary executors' logs and and a delay on job termination. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `majorMinorPatchVersion` to check major & minor version in `IsolatedClientLoader.hiveVersion`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `IsolatedClientLoader.hiveVersion` needs to enumerate all Hive patch versions. Therefore, whenever we upgrade Hive version we'd need to remember to update the method as well. It would be better if we just check major & minor version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a refactoring and relies on existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to sum up custom metric values instead of taking arbitrary one when combining `StateStoreMetrics`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor stateful join in structured streaming, we need to combine `StateStoreMetrics` from both left and right side. Currently we simply take arbitrary one from custom metrics with same name from left and right. By doing this we miss half of metric number.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this corrects metrics collected for stateful join.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2021-01-27T21:34:02Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:48Z","closed_at":"2021-01-30T04:51:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5967755b201eda9cafbe86ea49af519f36e550f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe currently SQL (temp or permanent) view resolution is done in 2 steps:\r\n1. In `SessionCatalog`, we get the view metadata, parse the view SQL string, and wrap it with `View`.\r\n2. At the beginning of the optimizer, we run `EliminateView`, which drops the wrapper `View`, and apply some special logic to match the view schema.\r\n\r\nStep 2 is tricky, as we need to retain the output attr expr id, while we need to add an extra `Project` to add cast and alias. This PR simplifies the view solution by building a completed plan (with cast and alias added) in `SessionCatalog`, so that we only have 1 step.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCode simplification. It also fixes issues like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31352\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes to add SQLMetrics instrumentation for Python UDF execution.  \r\nThe proposed metrics with a short description are:  \r\n\r\n<code>time spent executing</code> time spent executing the Python UDF and sending the results back to the executors. It can contain a component related to the time spent waiting for data to process, when data sending is slower compared to execution time\r\n<code>time spent sending data</code> time spent sending data to the Python workers, this is part of the Python UDF execution time\r\n<code>time spent sending code</code> time spent sending Python code to the Python workers\r\n<code>bytes of code sent</code> the number of bytes of serialized Python code sent the to the Python workers \r\n<code>bytes of data returned</code> the number of bytes of serialized data received back from the Python workers \r\n<code>bytes of data sent</code> the number of bytes of serialized data sent the to the Python workers\r\n<code>number of batches returned</code> the number of data batches received back from the Python workers\r\n<code>number of batches processed</code> the number of data batches sent to the Python workers\r\n<code>number of rows returned</code> the number of rows returned by the Python workers\r\n<code>number of rows processed</code> the number rows sent to the Python workers \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis aims at improving monitoring and performance troubleshooting of Python code called by Spark, via UDF, Pandas UDF or with MapPartittions. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe introduced SQL metrics are exposed to the end users via the WebUI interface, in the SQL tab, for execution steps related to Python UDF execution, namely BatchEvalPython, ArrowEvalPython, AggregateInPandas, FlaMapGroupsInPandas, FlatMapsCoGroupsInPandas, MapInPandas, WindowsInPandas.\r\nSee also the screenshot with the metrics introduced:\r\n![](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13019522/PythonSQLMetrics_Jira_Picture.png)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested + a python test has been added.\r\n\r\nExample code used for testing:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, pandas_udf\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\ndef test_pandas(col1):\r\n  time.sleep(0.02)\r\n  return col1 * col1\r\n\r\nspark.udf.register(\"test_pandas\", test_pandas)\r\nspark.sql(\"select rand(42)*rand(51)*rand(12) col1 from range(10000000)\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t1\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select max(test_pandas(col1)) from t1\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is used to test with more data pushed to the Python

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `SessionState.refreshTable()` and modify the tests where the method is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are already 2 methods with the same name in:\r\n- `SessionCatalog`\r\n- `CatalogImpl`\r\n\r\nOne more method in `SessionState` does not give any benefits. By removing it, we can improve code maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not because `SessionState` is an internal class.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *MetastoreDataSourcesSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the `handle large number of containers and tasks (SPARK-18750)` test with a time limit and in case of timeout it saves the stack trace of the running thread to provide extra information about the reason why it got stuck.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a flaky test which sometime runs for hours without stopping.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI checked it with a temporary code change: by adding a `Thread.sleep` to `LocalityPreferredContainerPlacementStrategy#expectedHostToContainerCount`. \r\n\r\nThe stack trace showed the correct method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] LocalityPlacementStrategySuite:\r\n[info] - handle

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31319 .\r\n\r\nWhen reading parquet int/long as decimal, the behavior should be the same as reading int/long and then cast to the decimal type. This PR changes to the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen reading parquet binary as decimal, we don't really know how to interpret the binary (it may from a string), and should fail. This PR changes to the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the behavior more sane.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, but it's a followup.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to extend the functionality of requirement for distribution and ordering on V2 write to specify the number of partitioning on repartition, so that data source is able to control the parallelism and determine the data distribution per partition in prior.\r\n\r\nThe partitioning with static number is optional, and by default disabled via default method, so only implementations required to restrict the number of partition statically need to override the method and provide the number.\r\n\r\nNote that we don't support static number of partitions with unspecified distribution for this PR, as we haven't found the real use cases, and for hypothetical case the static number isn't good enough. Javadoc clearly describes the limitation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe use case comes from feature parity with DSv1.\r\n\r\nI have state data source which enables the state in SS to be rewritten, which enables repartitioning, schema evolution, etc via batch query. The writer requires hash partitioning against group key, with the \"desired number of partitions\", which is same as what Spark does read and write against state.\r\n\r\nThis is now implemented as DSv1, and the requirement is simply done by calling repartition with the \"desired number\".\r\n\r\n```\r\nval fullPathsForKeyColumns = keySchema.map(key => new Column(s\"key.${key.name}\"))\r\ndata\r\n  .repartition(newPartitions, fullPathsForKeyColumns: _*)\r\n  .queryExecution\r\n  .toRdd\r\n  .foreachPartition(\r\n    writeFn(resolvedCpLocation, version, operatorId, storeName, keySchema, valueSchema,\r\n      storeConf, hadoopConfBroadcast, queryId))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to SPARK-34026, it's now possible to require the hash partitioning, but still not able to require the number of partitions. This PR will enable to let data source require the number of partitions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only for data source implementors. Even for them, this is no breaking change as default method is added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.","created_at":"2021-01-27T07:32:39Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T11:47:07Z","closed_at":"2021-03-29T14:33:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1cb8220e77855472ed5d5df087ccd43b31204e82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00fb5fb18644f4f3843349c7d66a3649a9a47649","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-34255","ref":"SPARK-34255","sha":"00fb5fb18644f4f3843349c7d66a3649a9a47649","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nObject hash aggregate will fallback to sort-based aggregation based on number of keys seen so far [0]. The default config threshold is 128 (spark.sql.objectHashAggregate.sortBased.fallbackThreshold in [1]). There's an edge case we can do better, where we do not fallback if there's no more input rows. Suppose the task only has 128 group-by keys in hash ma, we don't need to fallback in this case, and we can save the extra sort. This is an rare edge case in production, but it can happen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/ObjectAggregationIterator.scala#L161 \r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SQLConf.scala#L1615 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid unnecessary sort in query. Save resource.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a unit test to verify task fallback or not is challenging. Given the change is pretty minor, besides relying on existing test in `ObjectHashAggregateSuite.scala`, I manually ran the followed query, and verified in debug mode that the code path for fallback was not executed. And verified the code path for fallback was executed without this change.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwithSQLConf(\r\n  SQLConf.USE_OBJECT_HASH_AGG.key -> \"true\",\r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #31368 to add a test case that has a subquery with \"view\" in aggregate's grouping expression. The existing test tests a subquery with dataframe's temp view, so it doesn't contain a `View` node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo increase the test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Take into account the SQL config `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled` in the `TRUNCATE TABLE` command as other commands do.\r\n2. Re-calculate actual table size in fs. Before the changes, `TRUNCATE TABLE` always sets table size to 0 in stats.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the bug that is demonstrated by the example:\r\n1. Create a partitioned table with 2 non-empty partitions:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl (c0 int, part int) PARTITIONED BY (part);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl PARTITION (part=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl PARTITION (part=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> ANALYZE TABLE tbl COMPUTE STATISTICS;\r\nspark-sql> DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED tbl;\r\n...\r\nStatistics\t4 bytes, 2 rows\r\n...\r\n``` \r\n2. Truncate only one partition:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> TRUNCATE TABLE tbl PARTITION (part=1);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n```\r\n3. The table is still non-empty but `TRUNCATE TABLE` reseted stats:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> DESCRIBE TABLE EXTENDED tbl;\r\n...\r\nStatistics\t0 bytes, 0 rows\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt could impact on performance of following queries.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `StatisticsCollectionSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *StatisticsCollectionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *StatisticsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-01-26T17:39:31Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T07:02:10Z","closed_at":"2021-01-27T07:02:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c58dd0cba78f455a16f99d3e29df5d130712fcc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6ccad5b2c943788a43fcba9ed2a3b946592ef03","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-stats-in-trunc-table","ref":"fix-stats-in-trunc-table","sha":"e6ccad5b2c943788a43fcba9ed2a3b946592ef03","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark ANSI mode, the type coercion rules are based on the type precedence lists of the input data types. \r\nAs per the section \"Type precedence list determination\" of \"ISO/IEC 9075-2:2011\r\nInformation technology — Database languages - SQL — Part 2: Foundation (SQL/Foundation)\", the type precedence lists of primitive data types are as following:\r\n\r\n- Byte: Byte, Short, Int, Long, Decimal, Float, Double\r\n- Short: Short, Int, Long, Decimal, Float, Double\r\n- Int: Int, Long, Decimal, Float, Double\r\n- Long: Long, Decimal, Float, Double\r\n- Decimal: Any wider Numeric type\r\n- Float: Float, Double\r\n- Double: Double\r\n- String: String\r\n- Date: Date, Timestamp\r\n- Timestamp: Timestamp\r\n- Binary: Binary\r\n- Boolean: Boolean\r\n- Interval: Interval\r\n\r\nAs for complex data types, Spark will determine the precedent list recursively based on their sub-types.\r\n\r\nWith the definition of type precedent list, the general type coercion rules are as following:\r\n- Data type S is allowed to be implicitly cast as type T iff T is in the precedence list of S\r\n- Comparison is allowed iff the data type precedence list of both sides has at least one common element. When evaluating the comparison, Spark casts both sides as the tightest common data type of their precedent lists.\r\n- There should be at least one common data type among all the children's precedence lists for the following operators. The data type of the operator is the tightest common precedent data type.\r\n```\r\n In, Except(odd), Intersect, Greatest, Least, Union, If, CaseWhen, CreateArray, Array Concat,Sequence, MapConcat, CreateMap\r\n```\r\n\r\n- For complex types (struct, array, map), Spark recursively looks into the element type and applies the rules above. If the element nullability is converted from true to false, add runtime null check to the elements.\r\n\r\nNote: this new type coercion system will allow implicit converting String type literals as other primitive types, in case of breaking too many existing Spark SQL queries. This is a special rule and it is not from the ANSI SQL standard.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current type coercion rules are complex. Also, they are very hard to describe and understand. For details please refer the attached documentation \"Default Type coercion rules of Spark\"\r\n[Default Type coercion rules of Spark.pdf](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/5874362/Default.Type.coercion.rules.of.Spark.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is to create a new and strict type coercion system under ANSI mode. The rules are simple and clean, so that users can follow them easily\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes,  new implicit cast syntax rules in ANSI mode. All the details are in the first section of this description.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `ask` instead of `send` to sync the `ExecutorStateChanged` between Worker and Master and retry(up to 5 times) on the failure until the message is successfully handled by the Master. And the Worker would exit itself if the message can not be sent after 5 times retry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the Worker fails to send ExecutorStateChanged to the Master due to some unexpected errors, e.g., temporary network error, then the Master can't remove the finished executor normally and think the executor is still alive. In the worst case, if the executor is the only executor for the application, the application can get hang. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27507 implements `regexp_extract_all` and added the scala function version of it.\r\nAccording https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions.scala#L41-L59, it seems good for remove the scala function version. Although I think is regexp_extract_all is very useful, if we just reference the description.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`regexp_extract_all` is less common.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. `regexp_extract_all` was added in Spark 3.1.0 which isn't released yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-26T12:34:40Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T09:14:40Z","closed_at":"2021-01-26T21:53:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"482a8f0fc9c3cc83d2633985e548d00a8ab3811c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6a2d570f0715e3c49d35d11b087a483e67544c3a","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-24884-followup","ref":"SPARK-24884-followup","sha":"6a2d570f0715e3c49d35d11b087a483e67544c3a","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache
