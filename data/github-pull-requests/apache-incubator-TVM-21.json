PR enhances the LowerCrossThreadReduction pass with the thread-broadcasting block rewrite.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, previously whenever a TIR block has thread-broadcast behavior (i.e., there exists some thread var which is free for the block), we never insert a predicate for the block and therefore the generated final code has race condition, which sometimes lead to wrong computation results.\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the pass by collecting thread var information along transformation, and rewrite the thread-broadcast TIR block with additional predicate clauses which bound the thread vars and effectively state that \"only execute the block when `thread_var == 0`\". Therefore, the race condition issue in such blocks is resolved.","created_at":"2023-07-02T01:29:37Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T18:36:57Z","closed_at":"2023-07-03T18:36:56Z","merged_at":"2023-07-03T18:36:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"a60b815fe5f97806cbedad79712fb6e618425afe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/460736cf3a5414b2da49cbf30d9500e54fb9ebf1","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-07-01-thread-broadcast","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-07-01-thread-broadcast","sha":"460736cf3a5414b2da49cbf30d9500e54fb9ebf1","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

Motivation\r\nCurrently, our CUDA codegen would not utilize CUDA's [half2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC.html#group__CUDA__MATH____HALF2__ARITHMETIC) and [nv_bfloat162](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/group__CUDA__MATH____BFLOAT162__ARITHMETIC.html#group__CUDA__MATH____BFLOAT162__ARITHMETIC) intrinsics, and calls the scalar operators for each elements in the vector, which is not efficient. This PR improves the CUDA code by emitting half2 and nv_bfloat162 intrinsics when possible, and could potentially makes the generated program running faster (in case that nvcc didn't do this optimization for some programs).\r\n\r\nThe PR is based on #15183 and will be rebased to mainline after that PR get merged.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nSuppose a user is vectorizing the following operation:\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport tvm.tir as tir\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef vec_fp16(a: T.Buffer((128,), \"float16\"), b: T.Buffer((128,), \"float16\")):\r\n    for i in range(128):\r\n        with T.block(\"b\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.spatial(128, i)\r\n            b[vi] = a[vi] * T.float16(3.0) + T.float16(1.0)\r\n    \r\nsch = tir.Schedule(vec_fp16)\r\nb = sch.get_block(\"b\")\r\ni = sch.get_loops(b)[0]\r\nbx, tx, vec = sch.split(i, [2, 32, 2])\r\nsch.bind(bx, \"blockIdx.x\")\r\nsch.bind(tx, \"threadIdx.x\")\r\nsch.vectorize(vec)\r\n\r\nf = tvm.build(sch.mod[\"main\"], target=\"cuda\")\r\nprint(f.imported_modules[0].get_source())\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, TVM would emit the following CUDA code:\r\n```cuda\r\nextern \"C\" __global__ void __launch_bounds__(32) default_function_kernel(half* __restrict__ a, half* __restrict__ b) {\r\n  uint1 __1;\r\n    uint1 __2;\r\n      uint1 v_ = *(uint1*)(a + ((((int)blockIdx.x) * 64) + (((int)threadIdx.x) * 2)));\r\n      uint1 v__1 = make_uint1(__pack_half2(__float2half_rn(3.000000e+00f), __float2half_rn(3.000000e+00f)));\r\n      ((half2*)(&(__2.x)))->x = (((half2*)(&(v_.x)))->x*((half2*)(&(v__1.x)))->x);\r\n      ((half2*)(&(__2.x)))->y = (((half2*)(&(v_.x)))->y*((half2*)(&(v__1.x)))->y);\r\n    uint1 v__2 = make_uint1(__pack_half2(__float2half_rn(1.000000e+00f), __float2half_rn(1.000000e+00f)));\r\n    ((half2*)(&(__1.x)))->x = (((half2*)(&(__2.x)))->x+((half2*)(&(v__2.x)))->x);\r\n    ((half2*)(&(__1.x)))->y = (((half2*)(&(__2.x)))->y+((half2*)(&(v__2.x)))->y);\r\n  *(uint1*)(b + ((((int)blockIdx.x) * 64) + (((int)threadIdx.x) * 2))) = __1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, TVM would emit code that uses half2 instrinsics directly:\r\n```python\r\nextern \"C\" __global__ void __launch_bounds__(32) default_function_kernel(half* __restrict__ a, half* __restrict__ b) {\r\n  *(half2*)(b + ((((int)blockIdx.x) * 64) + (((int)threadIdx.x) * 2))) = ((*(half2*)(a + ((((int)blockIdx.x) * 64) + (((int)threadIdx.x) * 2))) * make_half2(__float2half_rn(3.000000e+00f), __float2half_rn(3.000000e+00f))) + make_half2(__float2half_rn(1.000000e+00f), __float2half_rn(1.000000e+00f)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @masahi @tqchen @junrushao @vinx13

using RPC server in NPU board, at some time a compiled model will hang the NPU, because of the buggy operator libraries of NPU toolchain, so we must to use the session_timeout to ensure the board resource can be released by the hang jobs.\r\n\r\nCurrently the handling of session timeout error in RPC server is not good, it just kill the server loop sub process, then in the destructor of  class `RPCEndpoint` will send the code of `kShutdown` to the RPC client, but the RPC client expect receive the code of `kReturn` or `kException`, so users will see the error message that like the one reported in  https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15151, this error report will make users very confused and don't know what's happened.\r\n\r\nWhen using tuning to search a good schedule for operators, we only want to ignore the RPC session timeout error that indicate the schedule generated is an illegal one, but other error reported by the RPC server may help us find the potential bug of our tool chain built on top of TVM, so the RPC session timeout error should be split to a standalone TVM error class.\r\n\r\nThis PR implemented these requirements by sending the RPC session timeout error message as a PRC server exception to the RPC client before kill the server loop sub

PR supports clearing up all the allocated memory in among relax VMs.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, all the allocated memory are managed in the pool of memory manager. The allocated memory in the pool is never freed and the pool size always goes up monotonically.\r\n\r\nWhile good to save time of memory allocation, in some cases (e.g., on mobile phones which may have running memory limit) we need to clear the pool and free all the memory in order to prevent the pool from endlessly growing up and some of allocated memory not being effectively utilized.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR introduces a PackedFunc that helps clear the

proposal #14899 for TIR, by the same method as PR #15140. Namely, a TIR PrimFunc can be specified to be private (without a global symbol attribute) in TVMScript in the `prim_func` decorator. By default, `PrimFunc`s are not private, so they will have a `global_symbol` attribute that is mapped to their name.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```python\r\n# not private: its global symbol will be \"func\"\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(...): ...\r\n\r\n# no global symbol included\r\n@T.prim_func(private=True)\r\ndef func(...): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis did require changing very, very many tests,

PR enhances the FuseOps pass to better support parameters in fused subfunctions where the parameter\r\n* denotes a Tuple, and\r\n* is accessed only by TupleGetItem in the fused subfunction.\r\n\r\nWe now name the property above as \"a Tuple param being partially used\". For example, in the following Relax function, parameter `x` is partially used, as it has 6 fields while only `x[0]` is effectively used in the function.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef fused_add_divide(\r\n    x: R.Tuple(\r\n        R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n        R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n        R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n        R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n        R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n        R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n    ),\r\n    param_0: R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n    param_1: R.Tensor((), dtype=\"float32\"),\r\n) -> R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n    R.func_attr({\"Primitive\": 1})\r\n    cls = Module\r\n    with R.dataflow():\r\n        x0: R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\") = x[0]\r\n        y0 = R.call_tir(cls.add, (x0, param_0), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n        gv = R.call_tir(cls.divide, (y0, param_1), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((2,), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n        R.output(gv)\r\n    return gv\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the FuseOps pass generates fused functions as above. As we can see, it frequently happens that an entire Tuple is passed into the function as input, while only few of its fields are effectively used in the function.\r\n\r\nThis behavior here lead to over-consumption of memory for the runtime kernel(s) that the fused subfunction will eventually become, which is a disaster when the Tuple length is very long. And this case indeed happens during our iteration of vertical applications (e.g., MLC-LLM), where if the model parameters are given as a Tuple of the main Relax function, the Tuple will have length of hundreds or even larger. In this case, even running compilation of the model takes much longer, and the dumped IRModule TVMScript has tens of MB in size, which is unaffordable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hereby update the FuseOps pass with better support on the partially accessed Tuple parameters. With the enhancement, when a Tuple parameter is partially accessed, we will replace the Tuple parameter with the list of new parameters, one for each of its field that is accessed in the function. You can check the added unit test as a best illustrative example.","created_at":"2023-06-24T08:40:20Z","updated_at":"2023-06-24T13:03:15Z","closed_at":"2023-06-24T13:03:15Z","merged_at":"2023-06-24T13:03:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c3369c72f52467291a96346580c99cf093f179e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

work introduces a new object called `BlockDependenceInfo` that computes and returns block dependences. The idea is to be able to expose block level dependences to TIR passes without having to create an explicit schedules.\r\n\r\nThe patch introduces 2 main classes:\r\n1. `SRefTreeCreator` - This creates and returns a new SRefTree and returns a map from original statements to corresponding srefs\r\n2. `BlockDependenceInfo` - This object computes the actual dependences between blocks within a block scope and returns it for access in TIR passes\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation to\r\n[PR #15034](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15034) and completes the work started there to expose block level dependences to TIR passes\r\n\r\nNote: One major difference between the SRef Tree created for dependence analysis here versus the one already present in schedules is that this SRef tree only contains block nodes and not loops. This makes it easier to find the parent blocks (by just accessing `parent` member)","created_at":"2023-06-23T13:03:16Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T02:39:01Z","closed_at":"2023-06-24T08:37:45Z","merged_at":"2023-06-24T08:37:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"d26dc445bba5d6dea3396d53b0d1415b6afb39bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/978440e04bfe3c8f2e49448cfa3e03f368a618a4","head":{"label":"quic-sanirudh:add_dependence_info_analysis","ref":"add_dependence_info_analysis","sha":"978440e04bfe3c8f2e49448cfa3e03f368a618a4","user":{"login":"quic-sanirudh","id":63797228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzk3MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63797228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh","html_url":"https://github.com/quic-sanirudh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406768097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY3NjgwOTc=","name":"tvm","full_name":"quic-sanirudh/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"quic-sanirudh","id":63797228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzk3MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63797228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh","html_url":"https://github.com/quic-sanirudh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quic-sanirudh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/quic-sanirudh/tvm","description":"Open

Motivation\r\nCurrently, our `tensorize` schedule primitives rely on buffer read/write regions in the given block to perform pattern matching. However, for workloads such as block sparse operators, the read/write regions include some indices arraies that may fail `tensorize` primitive.\r\nIn SparseTIR we introduce a new schedule primitive called `hide_buffer_access` which allows us to hide certain buffer regions in a block so that the read/write buffer regions would be recognized by the `tensorize` primitive to further utilize tensor acceleration units.\r\nThis PR upstreams this schedule primitive to TensorIR mainline.\r\n\r\n# The schedule primitive interface\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def hide_buffer_access(self, block: BlockRV, buf_type: str, buf_index_array: List[int]) -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"Hide some buffer access in a given block.\r\n\r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        block : BlockRV\r\n            The block where we hide read access.\r\n        buf_type : str\r\n            The buffer type: \"read\"/\"write\".\r\n        buf_index_array : List[int]\r\n            The array of buffer indices we hide access.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef indirect_mem_access(a: T.handle, idx_a: T.handle, b: T.handle, idx_b: T.handle) -> None:\r\n    A = T.match_buffer(a, [128], dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    IA = T.match_buffer(idx_a, [10], dtype=\"int32\")\r\n    B = T.match_buffer(b, [128], dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    IB = T.match_buffer(idx_b, [10], dtype=\"int32\")\r\n\r\n    for i in range(10):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.spatial(10, i)\r\n            T.reads(A[IA[vi]], IA[vi])\r\n            T.writes(B[IB[vi]], IB[vi])\r\n            B[IB[vi]] = A[IA[vi]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter we perform hiding buffer access to `IA[vi]` via:\r\n```python\r\nsch = tir.Schedule(indirect_mem_access, debug_mask=\"all\")\r\nblock_b = sch.get_block(\"B\")\r\nsch.hide_buffer_access(block_b, \"write\", [1]) \r\n```\r\n\r\nthe desired transformed IR would be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef indirect_mem_access_hide_ia(a: T.handle, idx_a: T.handle, b: T.handle, idx_b: T.handle) -> None:\r\n    A = T.match_buffer(a, [128], dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    IA = T.match_buffer(idx_a, [10], dtype=\"int32\")\r\n    B = T.match_buffer(b, [128], dtype=\"float32\")\r\n    IB = T.match_buffer(idx_b, [10], dtype=\"int32\")\r\n\r\n    for i in range(10):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n

PR implements the proposal in #14899. Namely, the `@R.function` decorator now has an optional `private` attribute. If a function is marked as private, then it will not have a global symbol attached to it and thus will not be externally accessible. By default, functions are not private, so the parser does insert a global symbol for them.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how to use the privacy attribute:\r\n```python\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n    # Will not have a global symbol! Often not very useful to make main private...\r\n    @R.function(private=True)\r\n    def main(...): ...\r\n\r\n    # private is false by default. This function will have a global symbol (\"other\")\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def other(...): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPasses that introduce new functions should decide whether a global symbol should be included with those functions. Most of the time, this is not the case (e.g., the functions extracted by the lambda lifting pass probably should not be publicly accessible).\r\n\r\nNote that there are alternative approaches we can consider. For example, we may have \"private\" as a field on a function node and fill in the global symbol attributes _later_. This may be important for some passes.","created_at":"2023-06-21T22:17:37Z","updated_at":"2023-06-27T22:27:24Z","closed_at":"2023-06-27T13:31:44Z","merged_at":"2023-06-27T13:31:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"daf9c202ac5ad0b0a64043b486894b139e64e4de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR #8313 a parameter `max_function_args` was introduced. It leads to\r\nlimit the number of function arguments and in the case when this value is\r\nexceeded, then the concatenation layer is split into a several concat\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nI faced a problem on Adreno GPU that for kernel with a big number of\r\narguments the enqueueNDRange was crashed without any errors. The\r\nproblem appeared because of the huge number of arguments. But in this\r\ncase not only concat layer was a root cause of the problem. Also after\r\nfusing several operations the final functions had a big number of\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nAs it was discussed in #8313, adding a limitation on the number of\r\nfunction arguments to the FuseOps pass might be a good improvement. In\r\nthis PR I introduced such a mechanism for limiting the number of function\r\narguments for FuseOps pass and add an arguments limit to OpenCL devices\r\nat 128 parameters.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the current approach is to calculate the number of arguments for\r\neach node in the fusing algorithm and in case then the number of function\r\narguments exceeds the limit, specified by `max_function_args`, then the\r\nfusing should be stopped. In case when a node has several inputs and for\r\nsome of the inputs the number of arguments wasn't computed, then we\r\npostpone fusing for this node and will try to fuse this node later when\r\nthe number of arguments will be computed for all inputs. This approach\r\nwith postponed fusing helps to avoid additional computations during\r\ncompilation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the case of dynamic shapes should be handled.

to this commit, the tests in `test_tir_transform_inject_ptx_async_copy.py` registered the `\"tvm_callback_cuda_postproc\"` function during pytest collection, and used a global variable to disable its functionality outside of the tests in this file.  This had two major issues.  First, if any other test also installs a postproc function, these postproc function required by the NVPTX tests would be overwritten.  Second, if one of the NTPTX tests fails, the global variable controlling the postproc function would not be reset, causing any subsequent CUDA-related tests to also fail.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates these NVPTX tests to conditionally install the postproc function, to de-register it after the test instead of disabling its functionality, and to de-register it regardless of the test result.\r\n\r\nThis issue was initially found when debugging https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15103, when a failure in `test_tir_transform_inject_ptx_async_copy.py::test_cp_async_in_if_then_else` caused failures in 32 unrelated tests ([CI

`NDArray::CreateView(...)` requires the strides of the input array to be null. This makes it impossible to apply, for example, reshaping on an array which originally comes from PyTorch via `from_dlpack`.  \r\n\r\nThis PR relaxes the null check to allow non-null strides, as long as they are \"compact\". But after creating a view, the returned array no longer has strides.\r\n\r\nThis is a subset of new functionalities from another PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14771, which ended up causing disruptive changes across the stack. \r\n\r\n@Lunderberg @tqchen @vinx13 @yelite @sunggg

empty interval sets when empty extents are encountered.\r\nHandle empty regions when constructing ScheduleState.\r\n\r\nThe direct cause of the crash was constructing an expression `0 - pos_inf`: the latter operand is actually of type `handle`.  The root cause of the issue was that the region connected to `T.grid(0, 8, 8)` was not explicitly recognized as empty early enough, and the extent of 0 was simply used in the related arithmetic to compute further expressions.\r\n\r\nWithout the fix, the testcase fails with the following traceback:\r\n```\r\n[15:08:28] /w/src/aitools/tvm-upstream/src/tir/op/op.cc:174: 0 pos_inf\r\nTraceback

commit resolves a flaky test failure that was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15081.  The unit test `tests/python/unittest/test_meta_schedule_schedule_rule_mlt_tc.py::test_padded_matmul_relu` failed approximately 30% of the time.\r\n\r\nThe error was due to changes in `IterMapRewriter::NormalizeToIterWithOffset`.  When attempting a simplfication with `TryCombineSplitFromSameSource`, if the returned `Optional<IterSumExpr>` is defined, but the `args.size() < 1` check fails, then the `expr` argument is still overwritten, and presumably can cause a later `TryFuseIters(expr)` to fail.\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces `expr = opt.value();` with `auto combined = opt.value();`, preserving the original

to this commit, the `\"ret_void\"` argument needed to be explicitly provided to `CodeGenLLVM::AddFunction` and `CodeGenLLVM::DeclareFunction`.  If this was inconsistent with the `builtin::ret()` usage within the `PrimFunc`, this could cause the incorrect return type in the generated LLVM-IR, resulting in LLVM IR verification failures.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the `\"ret_void\"` argument, instead using the type annotation in `PrimFunc::ret_type`, removing this opportunity for inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to

constant scale and number of prod symbols in descenting order.\r\n\r\nWe also ensures that each scale is in the form of symbol * const (e.g. n * m * 4).

PR adds support of regular NMS operator.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n1. How to properly test added functionality? \r\nOther NMS implementations, e.g., fast NMS, use a TF frozen graph from TF official website to convert a model to TFLite and keep NMS operations only. In order to create a similar test, we need to find an archive on TF official website that contains a frozen graph of a model compiled with `--use-regular-nms=True` flag. We haven't found it yet, so any help is appreciated.\r\n3. Regular NMS requires two sort operations:\r\n   - Sorting the scores after selecting scores above `nms_score_threshold`. This PR implements this with a simple bubble sort in order to prove the algorithm's semantics. We tried to replace it with `tvm.contrib.sort.argsort`. It works well when testing the regular NMS with `run_tvm_graph` as fast NMS test does or building and running the regular NMS with llvm target. At the same time, it fails to build (error is provided below) when `target=ethos-u,cmsis-nn,c`. It seems that `__tvm_module_ctx` variable is only being initialized when `cpp` runtime is chosen.\r\n   The error:\r\n`error: '__tvm_module_ctx' undeclared (first use in this function)\r\n203 | if (TVMBackendGetFuncFromEnv(__tvm_module_ctx, \"tvm.contrib.sort.argsort\", &tvm_contrib_sort_argsort_packed) != 0) {`\r\n   - Sorting the scores of previous and current NMS steps. There are two alternatives here:\r\n      - implement some sorting algorithm as part of hybrid script (to replace current bubble sort)\r\n      - save the result of each NMS step and use `argsort` after the hybrid script part. This approach has a drawback as it requires significant amount of memory to store the results of each NMS step.","created_at":"2023-06-16T14:22:45Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T15:23:26Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T15:23:26Z","merged_at":"2023-07-31T15:23:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"619bb1d939588cd5972ccef64eb120701dceb5c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/156001116903bdec2938b298f13dd8432df5ebcc","head":{"label":"ilyag-grovety:regular-nms-support","ref":"regular-nms-support","sha":"156001116903bdec2938b298f13dd8432df5ebcc","user":{"login":"ilyag-grovety","id":92577591,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYSfNw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92577591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyag-grovety","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":615332962,"node_id":"R_kgDOJK08Yg","name":"tvm","full_name":"ilyag-grovety/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ilyag-grovety","id":92577591,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYSfNw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92577591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety","html_url":"https://github.com/ilyag-grovety","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilyag-grovety/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ilyag-grovety/tvm","description":"Open

I described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14669, when `FuseTIR` gets a fused function whose input includes a tuple, it flattens all tuple fields into parameters and arguments to the call, regardless of the actual usage of the field by the function body. \r\n\r\nIt turns out this is problematic for `DataflowReshapeRewrite`, which assumes that the input buffer to the fused reshape function always appears as the first parameter: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/src/relax/analysis/tir_op_pattern_kind.cc#L514. As described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14669, this is not necessarily the case if multiple reshapes follow `split`, since each of the fused `reshape` func gets three buffers as input. So `DataflowReshapeRewrite` fails to eliminate a trivial reshape func like https://gist.github.com/masahi/c29599d4879f26736b7cf7ed7331b4d8#file-reshape-txt-L12-L21 because it reshapes the second input buffer.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been fixed by making `FuseTIR` flatten only those tuple fields that are actually used by the function body. \r\n\r\n@Hzfengsy @MasterJH5574 @tqchen

PR integrates the kernel from https://github.com/tlc-pack/cutlass_fpA_intB_gemm. In addition to the original features in FasterTransformer, this derived implementation also supports residual fusion by https://github.com/tlc-pack/cutlass_fpA_intB_gemm/pull/1. \r\n\r\n* It only supports int4 weight for now, while the kernel supports int8 as well. \r\n* The kernel expects a simple symmetric quantization scheme where each column of `(K, N)` matrix is scaled by the corresponding element from a scale vector of shape `(N,)`. Each scale is calculated over the K axis.\r\n* The weight matrix needs to be packed into int8 storage with shape `(K, N / 2)`. \r\n* The packed weight needs to be preprocessed by a special function defined in `contrib/cutlass/weight_preprocess.cc`, which in turn does various preprocessings on the weight implemented in https://github.com/tlc-pack/cutlass_fpA_intB_gemm/blob/main/cutlass_kernels/cutlass_preprocessors.cc. These processes are not well documented, so we wrap them into a packed function and use it as a black box. \r\n\r\nThe test case demonstrates the overall integration flow. It is interesting to note that, although encode / decode functions are expressed as TIR, we can still use the graph-based BYOC to integrate this kernel.\r\n\r\n@sunggg @yelite @vinx13 @Hzfengsy

PR implements the suggestion proposed in #14899 and allows function purity to be annotated in the `@R.function` decorator instead of using a fake method call (`R.is_pure()` or `R.is_impure()`). This required various changes to the parser to support, but can be used as a template for adding further optional parameters to `@R.function`.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is how an impure function can be declared:\r\n```python\r\n@R.function(pure=False)\r\ndef f(...): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default value of `pure` is `True`, so there is no need to include an annotation for a function that is already pure (which will usually be the case in Relax).\r\n\r\nNote that it will also still be valid to use the decorator without any arguments, as here:\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef f(...): ...\r\n# f will be treated as pure\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee `entry.py` for how the `function` decorator has been modified to support this.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @junrushao for guiding me through some of the moving parts in the parser. Further thanks is due to @tqchen, as he showed how the convenient decorator interface could be implemented in the discussion for #14899.","created_at":"2023-06-15T17:55:56Z","updated_at":"2023-06-17T14:48:37Z","closed_at":"2023-06-17T14:47:33Z","merged_at":"2023-06-17T14:47:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"16158e7cc301f82f0034da0229125fd6778dc8cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

Pull Request adds support for AMD Matrix Core in TVM.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\nThe following changes have been made to enable AMD Matrix Core support in TVM:\r\n\r\n- Added ROCm tensor intrins for AMD Matrix Core architecture.\r\n- Added test case of a 1024x1024x1024 dense gemm on each of these computations\r\n- Implemented the required tile sizes for Matrix FMA (MFMA) computations. The available tile sizes for MFMA are as follows:\r\n  - Integer computation: i8xi8\r\n  - Half-precision computation: f16xf16\r\n  - Single-precision computation: f32xf32\r\n\r\n\r\nrefer to AMD matrix core [readme](https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-lab-notes/amd-lab-notes-matrix-cores-readme/),  available tile for the given computations could be:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment-->\r\n\r\nA/B Data Format | C/D Data Format | M | N | K | Blocks | Cycles | Flops/cycle/CU\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nFP32 | FP32 | 32 | 32 | 2 | 1 | 64 | 256\r\nFP32 | FP32 | 16 | 16 | 4 | 1 | 32 | 256\r\nFP16 | FP32 | 32 | 32 | 8 | 1 | 64 | 1024\r\nFP16 | FP32 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 1 | 32 | 1024\r\nINT8 | INT32 | 32 | 32 | 8 | 1 | 64 | 1024\r\nINT8 | INT32 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 1 | 32 | 1024\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nFor each of these computations, only one intrinsic has been chosen for implementation. This decision is based on their identical TFLOPS performance.

some operations in `tvm.tir.op` required the operand to already be a `PrimExpr`, and raised an error if the operand was instead a python object.  This could cause failures round-trip through TVMScript, as int32 and float32 types are printed as literals in TVMScript, relying on automatic conversion to convert them back into `PrimExpr` objects.  For example, `T.expr2(T.int32(0))` is printed as `T.expr2(0)`, which then passes the python object `0` into `tvm.tir.op.expr2` when parsing the TVMScript.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the operations in `tvm.tir.op` to convert operands prior to accessing `operand.dtype`, avoiding the error and allowing these expressions to round-trip.\r\n\r\nThis issue was first noticed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15076 for `T.ret(0)`, but applied to any operator that used the operand's dtype without first normalizing to

PR addresses an issue #15019 I opened previously, regarding the PlanDevices pass's failure in cases where two operators share the same input but are intended to be assigned to different target devices. This scenario can often occur in the context of a neural network, where multiple layers can process the same input.\r\n\r\nIn the specific case of an operation `(a+b)*(b+c)`, where the first add operator is assigned to the CPU and the second one to the GPU, PlanDevices pass would fail as it had difficulty determining the correct device for b.\r\n\r\nThe problematic behavior seemed to be due to PlanDevices pass marking `b` for the CPU (when it first visits `a+b`), and then throwing an error when it attempts to place b on the GPU while visiting `b+c`.\r\n\r\nThe solution I've implemented in this PR is the automatic addition of a `device_copy`. This means that if `b` is assigned to CPU after visiting `a+b` , the PlanDevices pass will append a `device_copy` to copy `b` to GPU when visiting

PR removed the wrong assertion about UpSampling2D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Keras frontend of TVM, The UpSampling2D has a wired constraint: \"Height must equal width for operator Upsample.\" \r\n\r\nHowever,  from the [documentation about UpSampling2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/up_sampling2d/), The constraint about `size` is, \" Int, or tuple of 2 integers\".  Meanwhile, An official example from the Keras documentation uses the size(1, 2)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/tvm/assets/29506758/457f54ef-89e3-4196-9ae5-44f5a8fc0249). \r\n\r\nThus, the assertion in TVM is wrong.

the return value of a PackedFunc was hard-coded as the string `\"return 0;\"` in `CodeGenCHost`, which could cause compilation errors for `PrimFunc` returning `DataType::Void()`.  This PR removes this explicit return statement from `CodeGenCHost`, replacing it with `tir::ret(Integer(0))` in the `MakePackedAPI` and `MakeUnpackedAPI` transforms.\r\n\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15073, which performs an analogous change for the function
