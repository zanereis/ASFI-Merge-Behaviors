has been removed from this class with a fixme (BEAM-2685), which\r\nmeans there' no longer any runtime checking of @abc.abstractmethod. However,\r\nmypy still performs abc.abtractmethod/property checks even if a class does\r\nnot use abc.ABCMeta (this is a feature that lets you avoid using metaclasses).\r\n\r\nThe problem arises because the beam code is doing a lot of dynamic patching of\r\nto_runner_api_parameter (see register_pickle_urn), which mypy cannot track, so\r\nit believes this method is missing.\r\n\r\nWe comment out @abc.abstractmethod, to disable the mypy checks (it's already\r\ndisabled at runtime by virtue of an earlier change to remove abc.ABCMeta).\r\nWe change the method to raise NotImplementedError to inform pylint not to trust\r\nits return value (None) and to get some degree of runtime checking.\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to #9056.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb \r\nR: @udim \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This PR adds a readAll method that returns a PTransform<PCollection<Read<A>>, PCollection<A>> to allow for more fine grained querying of a Cassandra compatible databases (Cassandra, Scylla etc).  Since each Read<A> allows one to specify a Query and/or RingRange, a pipeline does not have to do a full table scan to retrieve data, it can now read a subset using this pattern.  \r\n\r\nBecause Read<A> allows the user to specify a Set<RingRange>, this allows even more flexibility, in that a user can decide to put N number of RingRanges (which each could be representing individual keys) in a single Read<A>, this allows one to *linearize* queries, which is very important when doing a large number of individual queries so as to not overload single shards or cores.   \r\n\r\n\r\n_Old comment for posterity, not relevant to the current redesign after working with @iemejia: This PR adds a readAll method that returns a `PTransform<PColl<List<RingRange>>, PCollection<T>>` to allow for parallel querying of a small subset of a Cassandra databse.  In addition, it refactors the current method `read` that returns a `PTransform<PBegin, PColl<T>>` to be a ParDo based one, so we can share code between read and readAll.  \r\nNote: One thing I wasn't sure about was how to abstract over AutoValue classes.  I'm much more familiar with Scala than Java and haven't used AutoValue before, so I wasn't sure if there was a better way than what I did with having a `getCassandraConfig` on both the static Read class as well as the ReadAll class.  Don't think I can use an interface since I don't want the methods public.  Open to suggestions here._ \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for being patient with a large change and please let me know if I can change/add anything!  \r\n\r\nR:@iemejia

Goal\r\n\r\nIt's possible for the tarball uploaded to GCS to be quite large. An example is a user vendoring multiple dependencies in their tarball so as to achieve a more stable deployable artifact.\r\n\r\nBefore this change the GCS upload api call executed a multipart upload, which Google [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/how-tos/upload) states should be used when the file is small enough to upload again when the connection fails. For large tarballs, we will hit 60 second socket timeouts before completing the multipart upload. By passing `total_size`, apitools first checks if the size exceeds the resumable upload threshold, and executes the more robust resumable upload rather than a multipart, avoiding\r\nsocket timeouts.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

change allows users with Avro GenericRecords that utilize non-microsecond timestamp values to utilize BigQueryUtils.toBeamRow to convert those GenericRecords into Beam Rows. This functionality was required for our implementation, as were generating GenericRecords from Scala case classes and didn't have direct access to the implementation which chose the precision of the timestamp value to be generated based on Instant fields (these Instant fields were converted to milliseconds in our case). Testing shows that the functionality works for nested rows and arrays. The implementation should not affect any existing use cases as it preserves the original API. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
