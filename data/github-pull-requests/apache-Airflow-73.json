tables related to user management (`ab_permission`, `ab_view_menu`, `ab_role`, `ab_permission_view`, `ab_permission_view_role`, `ab_user`, `ab_user_role`, `ab_register_user`) are used exclusively by the FAB auth manager. Since in #35926, FAB auth manager is getting moved to providers, we should no longer have migrations related to these tables in core Airflow. If these tables need a migration, we would need to implement a mechanism where providers could vendor-in migrations and then, add these migrations in the `fab` provider. Since we are not sure such migrations will be added, I dont think it is necessary to implement the mechanism now. \r\n\r\nThis PR prevent adding any additional migrations related to these fab tables.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a result of the [lazy consensus](https://lists.apache.org/thread/o457svvnsn4xdnb7j79jyqsxvldj6qmz), this PR creates a new provider: fab. This new provider contains (and should always only contain?) the FAB manager that is in core Airflow for now. \r\n\r\nIt basically moves files from `airflow.auth.managers.fab` to `airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager`.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does NOT include and will be done in following PRs:\r\n- Pre-install the FAB provider in Airflow\r\n- Remove `flask-login` as dependency in core Airflow (only some tests in core Airflow are using it now, should be pretty easy to remove)\r\n- Move FAB auth manager related configuration from core Airflow config to provider config\r\n- Move FAB auth manager related documentation from core Airflow documentation to provider documentation\r\n- Create documentation related to FAB auth manager\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Cython release caused pymssql package failures when they were installed on ARM platform.

rootless docker is becoming more and more popular and soon likely becomes standard, we should recognise it in our decisions when it comes to runnig Breeze as it changes some of the basic assumptions about files and ownership we had when we designed how we are running containers in Breeze.\r\n\r\nReviewed the places where \"rootless docker\" had an impact and fixed a typo in fix-ownership (it did not matter because fix-ownership was not even executed in linux in the first place, but it should be fixed for consistency).\r\n\r\nDocumented the rootless docker in the ADRs for breeze as this is building on top of the ADR 6 and ADR 14 where the root user and ownership fixing decisions were made.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor

you are starting old version of airflow using the command `breeze start-airflow --use-version` you might already have a new version of the database runnign - that is both Postgres DB running in the background and Postgres DB volume when the database files are stored.\r\n\r\nSince older version of Airflow does not know this new version, it will fail attempts to migrate to the current version with `Can't locate revision identified by 'xxxx'` error.\r\n\r\nThis PR automatically adds `docker-compose down` command including removing volumes and orphan containers whenver you pass the `--use-airflow-version` flag in order to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\nThis makes `--use-airflow-version` slower but in many cases will avoid an error followed by manual running of `--use-airflow-version` and confusion it creates by printing the cryptic error.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

recent refactors, common_pre_commit_utils have rich as dependency so any pre-commits that cannot have rich set as dependency should not use it.\r\n\r\nThe \"compile-www-assets\" and \"compile-www-assets-dev\" pre-commits are \"node\" pre-commits - which means that they are not installing python dependencies - they at most might install node dependencies, and we cannot specify rich as dependency using pre-commit mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe \"compile-www-assets\" and \"compile-www-assets-dev\" are pretty special, because they are \"manual\" stage pre-commits so they are not executed in CI and we have not detected them failing in latest refactor.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes those pre-commit python scripts work only using stdlib imports and add warning to avoid adding other imports.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

comon initialization code for pre-commits that allows to use a simpler way of running pre-commits with breeze ci image. Rather than running a custom `docker` command, we are using the `breeze shell` command to run the command inside the image. We are also fixing a problem where the ER diagram was generated using random backend - we force it now to use Postgres as backend.\r\n\r\nThere are few small problems solved as part of it as well:\r\n\r\n* We are also switching the console used to be the standard colored one so that the output will use colors also in git hook and CI.\r\n\r\n* When image needs update we are going to warn about it in the builds that are \"serial\" (i.e. do not run in parallell) that the image should be upgraded. We are not doing it for checks that use parallelism because it would pollute the output too much (and those are usually not run with images anyway).\r\n\r\n* There was an error where pre-commit run with breeze would also start port-forwarding if database was started together with it, so pre-commit project no longer adds port forwarding for backends.\r\n\r\n* If there was a database stated as part of pre-commit project, it would continue running after pre-commit completed, which is undesireable. The pre-commit will now stop pre-commit project after completion.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

to remove MSSQL support from Airflow - as discussed and voted in https://lists.apache.org/thread/pgcgmhf6560k8jbsmz8nlyoxosvltph2\r\n\r\nThis PR removes MSSQL from:\r\n- Core Metadatabase\r\n- (Historic) Migration scripts\r\n- Documentation\r\n\r\nIt does NOT remove the provider package, so no mis-understanding: Apache Airflow further will \"work\" with MSSQL and the provider package and features are un-touched. All Operators keep in place. Just the metadata support is reduced to sqlite (dev only), Postgres, MySQL.\r\nNote that for this also the build of MSSQL client code is kept inside the Docker as Provider packages rely on this availability.\r\n\r\nPreconditions before merge:\r\n- Discuss where the MSSQL migration script from PR #35861 will be available and update docs accordingly\r\n- Green build - probably fails until PR #35830 is open\r\n- Double check - is there any change in build matrix needed after removal of

`shell` command has been foreseen eventually to also allow single commands in CI and pre-commit, and we are preparing it to be able to do so with all the bells and whistles. There are a few improvements needed to be able to do it smoothly.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that were preventing using `breeze shell` as general-purpose commmand executor:\r\n\r\n* we used defailt `docker-compose` project for running compose runs (derived from `docker-compose` parent folder of the `basy.yml` compose file. If we want to run standalone commands, we need to run them in separate projects in order to allow to run them while `breeze` shell is already running\r\n\r\n* when runing command in pre-commit hook, there is no terminal available because this command is run deep under-the-hood in git internals and it is run as command detached from the terminal it runs in. For that automated terminal allocation strategy used by docker compose was not working\r\n\r\n* breeze prints a lot of diagnostics of what's going on when you run the entrypoint by default - including diagnostics information printed by docker compose and automated docker builds. This is polluting the output of automated scripts (especially in pre-commits)\r\n\r\n* breeze command checks by defalt if image needs to be upgraded and prints information about it and allows the user to trigger the upgrade by answering \"yes\" for 10 seconds. This add extra delay and unnecessary information when running the scripts in pre-commits and generally in unattended mode.\r\n\r\n* Breeze CI entrypoint uses additional environment initialization when entering the container - it waits until DBs are available and performs few other initializaiton checks (for example loading scripts from `init.sh`. All that is not needed and should be skipped when running standalone scripts.\r\n\r\n* Sometimes it's not obious what internal commands are run by breeze shell - and it's difficult to debug/diagnose it. We run CI commands with `--verbose` flags so those command should not be printed even if `--verbose` flag is used though as they are polluting the output.\r\n\r\n* By default some flags are persistently stored after used (python version, backend, backend version) and they are \"cached\" - they are automatically used next time you start breeze - to keep the environment you use for the last time. Those shoudl not be persisted when running standalone command and want to override Python version or backend only in the command you want to execute.\r\n\r\nThe PR implements the following changes to improve those aspects:\r\n\r\n* Allow specifying `--project-name` when running `breeze`, `breze shell` `breeze start-airflow` and `breeze down` commands. Default project is `breeze` now and user can use any project but predefined ones are also `pre-commit` (to be used in pre-commits) and legacy `docker-compose` if one would like to use `breeze down` to shut down some remaining containers from the legacy project.\r\n\r\n* Add `--restart` (aliased by `--remove-orphans`) flag that might be used when starting the command, which will also remove orphan containers (for example postgres container running while we are switching to sqlite).\r\n\r\n* Add `--tty` option (\"auto\", \"disabled\", \"enabled\") in `breeze shell` command. This flag allows to determine strategy of terminal allocation by the underlying docker-compose flags.\r\n\r\n* Add `--quiet` flag that silences the output of entrypoint diagnostics including the output of docker-compose and docker build when they are running as part of the command.\r\n\r\nNOTE: We also need to upgrade min docker-compose and docker version as we are using features available only in recent versions of these that allow to suppress some output.\r\n\r\n* Add `--skip-image-upgrade-check` in `breeze shell` to avoid checking if upgrade is needed. However if the image is not present, the latest version will be upgraded anyway - this allows to run pre-commits even if breeze has not been used before or `docker system prune -a` was used. We had `--skip-image-check` before, but we rename it to explain what check we are talking about.\r\n\r\n* Add `--skip-environment-initialization` in `breeze shell` to skip all initialization happening for interactive breeze entering.\r\n\r\n* Add `--verbose-commands` flag in `breeze shell`. For a long time we had `VERBOSE_COMMANDS` env variable support doing it (and printing commands as they are executed) but adding it explicitly as flag makes it easier discoverable and usable.\r\n\r\n* Add `SKIP_SAVING_CHOICES` environment variable. When this variable is set, the choices you specify when runing breeze command are not stored in cache and only used for the particular command you execute.\r\n\r\nFew other cleanups and minor fixes  were also implemented as part of this change:\r\n\r\n* the click decorators and corresponding parameters in breeze/shell/start-airflow commands have been sorted to easier manage them (adding/updating the option became a real pain for those as they have a lot of them)\r\n\r\n* version_suffix_for_pypi default for CI image has been set up to dev0 to make automated upgrade after pressing `Y` use the same cache as `docker ci-image build`\r\n\r\n* added PYTHONWARNINGS to be forwardeable from host environment to container - which allows to control which warnings to display.\r\n\r\n* only print \"Github Actions\" group end when we are running inside GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\n* switch from distutls Versions to packaging Version - used to check pre-commit version (better Python 3.12 compatibility)\r\n\r\n* clarified that executor flag for \"shell\" command can accept more values than the one in \"start-airflow\"\r\n\r\n* when config options are not synchronized with \"rich-click\" help groups, proper location is displayed in error messsages (it asked to fix the issue in non-existing files).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a migration tool in order to deprecate MSSQL support in Airflow 2.8.0\r\n\r\nI placed this in the `/scripts/tools` folder for now as it is not something targetted (yet) to be supported in main airflow core. Nevertheless because of the nature how it is it _could_ be made into one `airflow db ...` command.\r\nI am open where we store it (for the moment).\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n- Jump on any (dev or test) Airflow instance running 2.7.3, copy the python file `migrate_script.py` into a place where the Airflow python env is available\r\n- Stop the runnign airflow processes and execute `python migrate_script.py --extract` and see that a `migration.db` SQLite file is built in your current folder.\r\n- Copy the `migration.db` and the `migrate_script.py` to a test environment with Airflow 2.7.3, stop the airflow processes and and execute `python migrate_script.py --restore` - before hitting enter ensure no valuable data is contained, as it will wipe the DB content before copy!\r\n- Start the Airflow processes and check that the content from the source system is visible in the UI. Check scheduler and logs of worker for errors. Start a DAG to see the system can run new stuff. Log-on with another user as well\r\n\r\nI tested with:\r\n- Source MSSQL, Target MySQL, Postgres and SQLite\r\n- Example DAGs, execucted some runs, added a user, a variable and a pool\r\n\r\nThere might be other data \"in the wild\", probably there will be \"glitches\" if more situations are seen.

both \"wait-for-ci-images\" and  \"preview-constraints\" jobs are waiting for images to be built - which means that they both take a running worker slot (public runner) just to do the waiting while the image is being built. Also \"verify-image\" job is run as part of \"wait-for-image\" which adds additional delay between being downloaded and dependent jobs starting.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes it quite a bit:\r\n\r\n* preview-constraints job now depends on \"wait-for-ci-images\". This means that only one slot will be busy while waiting for images.\r\n\r\n* both CI and PROD `verify-image` commands in breeze got --run-in-parallel set of flags that allow the verification to happen for all images in parallel.\r\n\r\n* Image verification is added as separate step in jobs that already need to pull the images to do other stuff. For CI Image it's \"Preview constraints\" and for PROD image it is \"Test Docker compose job\". The fact that they are not run as part of \"wait for image\" jobs allows us to start the other jobs faster but also to not let failure in image verification block other tests from running.\r\n\r\n* In case of the \"in-workflow-build\" the \"wait-for-ci-images\" does not have to be run at all, because there wait-for-ci-images depends on in-workflow build-ci-images job - so if that job completes, we know image is built already and we do not have to wait for it separately - so far we had to run it in order to add `--verify` flag to verify the images. With separate job we can run i  in parallel to all the other waiting jobs.\r\n\r\n* Also names and dependencies between jobs are updated, including CI documentation describing diagrams of how CI workflows work. The diagrams are cleaned-up/verified and updated. The separate diagram for scheduled build has been removed as it was essentially the same as \"canary build\". A paragraph description for every type of workflow was added to add more context to the diagrams.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The Trigger also doesn't look to be set up for other use cases supported in the usual blocking implementation - multiple task IDs, or task groups. I don't have the confidence to fix the trigger for these use cases, but wanted to add a warning so other people would be aware of this limitation from the documentation rather than stumbling into it like me! =)\r\n\r\nThings that I'm still unsure of:\r\n* Is there a good way to reference an issue from within a warning block? (And is a warning block appropriate for this?)\r\n* Is it worth adding a doc newsfragment for this?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

of our pre-commits were using code from Breeze in rather complex\r\nway - by inserting PYTHONPATH and importing code from there. That was\r\ncomplex and brittle and with recent changes of ShelParam https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35801 those\r\nprecommits required more and more dependencies to be added to their\r\npre-commit virtualenvs.\r\n\r\nThe reason that it was done this way was the assumption that someone\r\nmight want to run pre-commits locally without having breeze installed,\r\nbut this assumption and use case is rather unlikely, becasue breeze\r\nbecomes more and more useful and used so we can safely assume that\r\nanyone who wants to do pre-commits will also have breeze installed and\r\non path. And anyway to run those pre-commits you need to have breeze\r\nCI image pulled and built, so you should generally have breeze to run\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis PR finishes the series of PRs implementing the refactor and\r\ncompletes the refactor.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Amazon Verified Permissions to check user permissions related to variables in AWS auth manager. This PR is the first one to implement a `is_authorize_*` method in AWS auth manager, and as such create all the blocks to communicate with Amazon Verified Permissions. The future PRs implementing the other `is_authorize_*` methods will use these blocks and should be smaller and more straightforward. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This all happened in various models and it was scattered around the code and it was difficult to grasp what was going on.\r\n\r\nThis PR consolidates it so that all variables are set in ShellParams object.\r\n\r\n* the attributes have been reviewed and None/\"\" default values were set where needed\r\n* the attributes were sorted\r\n* calculation of dynamic properties was moved to ShellParams\r\n* missing properties were added to ShellParams, so that all variables have corresponding properties\r\n* the get_env_variables_for_docker_commands is now a method in ShellParams object, mapping is done explicitly from self.ATTRIBUTE and default values if not set are set in this single place if not set in case the variables are are retrieved from elsewhere\r\n* we use ShellParams in all places where we execute docker commands (we used BuildCiParams) sometimes needlessly\r\n* tests are added to cover the \"attribute\" + \"incoming env var\" to the env vars passed to Docker Compose/Docker\r\n\r\nMost importantly the docker and docker-compose env files are now automatically generated and git-ignored so that we only need to maintain the list of variables to pass in a single plase - in ShellParams `env_variables_for_docker_commands` method.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#32928\r\n\r\nA race condition occurs in the _adopt_completed_pods function when schedulers are running concurrently. _adopt_completed_pods function doesn't keep track of which scheduler went down so it constantly tries to adopt completed pods from normally working schedulers. On Airflow setups with concurrently running schedulers and with a lot of short living DAG's it leads to race condition and open slots leak. You can find detailed analysis of this situation in GitHub issue here (https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32928#issuecomment-1820413530) Even if one of the schedulers went down and left some pods in completed state it is not a big deal because: \r\n1. Completed pods do not consume resources from kubernetes cluster \r\n2. They can be deleted by airflow cleanup-pods CLI command which you can execute with the cronjob.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Vlad Pastushenko iam@vladpi.me\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

some reason (likely importing some stuff from setup.py in the old days) pendulum was added as dependency in breeze - which still caused a problem when `pipx` decided to use Python 3.12 to install Breeze (despite #35652 that was supposed to supersede #35620).\r\n\r\nThe #35620 adding a need to specify python additionally when you install breeze added it's own complexity (which python?), it turns out that breeze does not need to have pendulum installed at all now (we stopped depending on airflow being installed and stopped importing things from setup.py or __version__ in favour of directly parsing __version__ variable from python code.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes pendulum entirely as Breeze dependency.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or

`--force-build` command has not been used for a long time in the `ci-image build` command for quite some time because the sheer fact that you run the command means that you want to run the build (so it made no sense to have it). The command only makes sense when you want to force build when running `breeze` or `breeze start-airflow` command.\r\n\r\nHowever commands to build cache in CI still had this command used and it caused the builds to fail after merging #35768 when the option has been removed (it was not detected there, because cache steps only run in main build)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
