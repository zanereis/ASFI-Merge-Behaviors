For example:\r\n```\r\n@pandas_udf(\"int\", PandasUDFType.SCALAR_ITER)\r\ndef the_udf(iterator):\r\n    for col1_batch, col2_batch in iterator:\r\n        yield col1_batch + col2_batch\r\n\r\ndf.select(the_udf(\"col1\", \"col2\"))\r\n```\r\nThe udf above will add col1 and col2.\r\n\r\nI haven't add unit tests, but manually tests show it works fine. So it is ready for first pass review.\r\nWe can test several typical cases:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\nfrom pyspark.taskcontext import TaskContext\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 20), (3, 40)], [\"a\", \"b\"])\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"int\",

fi2(\"b\"), fi3(\"a\", \"b\")` will generate only one plan,\r\n# and `fu1(\"a\")`, `fp1(\"a\")` will generate another two separate plans.\r\ndf.select(fi1(\"a\"), fi2(\"b\"), fi3(\"a\", \"b\"), fu1(\"a\"), fp1(\"a\")).show()\r\n\r\n# test chain two pandas iter udf together\r\n# Note this case `fi2(fi1(\"a\"))` will generate only one plan\r\n# Also note the init stuff/close stuff call order will be like:\r\n# (debug output following)\r\n#     DBG: fi2: do init stuff, partitionId=0\r\n#     DBG: fi1: do init stuff, partitionId=0\r\n#     DBG: fi1: do close stuff, partitionId=0\r\n#     DBG: fi2: do close stuff, partitionId=0\r\ndf.select(fi2(fi1(\"a\"))).show()\r\n\r\n# test more complex chain\r\n# Note this case `fi1(\"a\"), fi2(\"a\")` will generate one plan,\r\n# and `fi3(fi1_output, fi2_output)` will generate another plan\r\ndf.select(fi3(fi1(\"a\"), fi2(\"a\"))).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTo be added.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to port AGGREGATES.sql from PostgreSQL regression tests. https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/02ddd499322ab6f2f0d58692955dc9633c2150fc/src/test/regress/sql/aggregates.sql#L1-L143\r\n\r\nThe expected results can be found in the link: https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/test/regress/expected/aggregates.out\r\n\r\nWhen porting the test cases, found three PostgreSQL specific features that do not exist in Spark SQL.\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27765: Type Casts: expression::type\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27766: Data type: POINT(x, y)\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27767: Built-in function: generate_series\r\n\r\nAlso, found two bugs:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27768: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN should be recognized in a case insensitive manner\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27769: Handling of sublinks within outer-level aggregates.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the error message when the column can't be resolved. \r\n\r\nFor running the regression tests, this PR also added three tables `aggtest`, `onek` and `tenk1` from the postgreSQL data sets: https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/02ddd499322ab6f2f0d58692955dc9633c2150fc/src/test/regress/data\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs outlined in the JIRA by @JoshRosen, our conversion mechanism from catalyst types to scala ones is pretty inefficient for primitive data types. Indeed, in these cases, most of the times we are adding useless calls to `identity` function or anyway to functions which return the same value. Using the information we have when we generate the code, we can avoid most of these overheads.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHere is a simple test which shows the benefit that this PR can bring:\r\n```\r\ntest(\"SPARK-27684: perf evaluation\") {\r\n    val intLongUdf = ScalaUDF(\r\n      (a: Int, b: Long) => a + b, LongType,\r\n      Literal(1) :: Literal(1L) :: Nil,\r\n      true :: true :: Nil,\r\n      nullable = false)\r\n\r\n    val plan = generateProject(\r\n      MutableProjection.create(Alias(intLongUdf, s\"udf\")() :: Nil),\r\n      intLongUdf)\r\n    plan.initialize(0)\r\n\r\n    var i = 0\r\n    val N = 100000000\r\n    val t0 = System.nanoTime()\r\n    while(i < N) {\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      plan(EmptyRow).get(0, intLongUdf.dataType)\r\n      i += 1\r\n    }\r\n    val t1 = System.nanoTime()\r\n    println(s\"Avg time: ${(t1 - t0).toDouble / N} ns\")\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe output before the patch is:\r\n```\r\nAvg time: 51.27083294 ns\r\n```\r\nafter, we get:\r\n```\r\nAvg time: 11.85874227 ns\r\n```\r\nwhich is ~5X faster.\r\n\r\nMoreover a benchmark has been added for Scala UDF. The output after the patch can be seen in this PR, before the patch, the output was:\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nUDF

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd yarn support for GPU-aware scheduling. Since SPARK-20327 already added yarn custom resource support, this jira is really just making sure the spark resource configs get mapped into the yarn resource configs and user doesn't specify both yarn and spark config for the known types of resources (gpu and fpga are the known types on yarn).\r\n\r\nYou can find more details on the design and requirements documented: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27376\r\n\r\nNote that the running on yarn docs already state to use it, it must be yarn 3.0+. We will add any further documentation under SPARK-20327\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manually testing on yarn cluster\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-17T15:59:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T21:45:35Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T20:26:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a49791e38db9bb24cfb77c52f09a2cf7f94708f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9fc16f36488c1fd804669912cfe1272417ff9112","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-27361","ref":"SPARK-27361","sha":"9fc16f36488c1fd804669912cfe1272417ff9112","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark on k8s supports config for specifying the executor cpu requests\r\n(spark.kubernetes.executor.request.cores) but a similar config is missing\r\nfor the driver. Instead, currently `spark.driver.cores` value is used for integer value.\r\n\r\nAlthough `pod spec` can have `cpu` for the fine-grained control like the following, this PR proposes additional configuration `spark.kubernetes.driver.request.cores` for driver request cores.\r\n```\r\nresources:\r\n  requests:\r\n    memory: \"64Mi\"\r\n    cpu: \"250m\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades lz4-java from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0. Lz4-java is available at https://github.com/lz4/lz4-java.\r\n\r\nChanges from 1.5.1:\r\n- Upgraded LZ4 to 1.9.1. Updated the JNI bindings, except for the one for Linux/i386. Decompression speed is improved on amd64.\r\n- Deprecated use of LZ4FastDecompressor of a native instance because the corresponding C API function is deprecated. See the release note of LZ4 1.9.0 for details. Updated javadoc accordingly.\r\n- Changed the module name from org.lz4.lz4-java to org.lz4.java to avoid using - in the module name. (severn-everett, Oliver Eikemeier, Rei Odaira)\r\n- Enabled build with Java 11. Note that the distribution is still built with Java 7. (Rei Odaira)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-16T19:11:51Z","updated_at":"2019-05-17T03:48:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-17T03:48:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f90b80d3d92f738b0b3420791334ea3c900e717","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24629/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24629/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24629/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1481cf70c4150d9350468ab9dd4f365b82a1fb8d","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-27752","ref":"SPARK-27752","sha":"1481cf70c4150d9350468ab9dd4f365b82a1fb8d","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's pretty useful if we can convert a physical plan back to a logical plan, e.g., in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24389\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new feature to `TreeNode`, which allows `TreeNode` to carry some extra information via a mutable map, and keep the information when it's copied.\r\n\r\nThe planner leverages this feature to put the logical plan into the physical plan.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na test suite that runs all TPCDS queries and checks that some common physical plans contain the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new future helper method that copies over spark properties before submitting to a new thread, and sets the original properties back on exit. SubqueryExec now uses this method to create futures. Any task that is submitted to its thread pool will now use the spark properties of the submitting thread, instead of the spark properties that were on the thread pool worker thread\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test, which fails with current master but passes with this patch\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-16T12:34:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T00:06:54Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T00:06:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"478a3ed4d79bd9d45df51e93cd3944ffc7aac5c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b765bf521bd0beef64799c13d6df543c5423220","head":{"label":"onursatici:os/subquery","ref":"os/subquery","sha":"4b765bf521bd0beef64799c13d6df543c5423220","user":{"login":"onursatici","id":5051569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTE1Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5051569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici","html_url":"https://github.com/onursatici","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110121704,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTAxMjE3MDQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"onursatici/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onursatici","id":5051569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTE1Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5051569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici","html_url":"https://github.com/onursatici","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onursatici/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onursatici/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen running large shuffles (700TB input data, 200k map tasks, 50k reducers on a 300 nodes cluster) the job is regularly OOMing in map and reduce phase.\r\n\r\nIIUC ShuffleExternalSorter (map side) and ExternalAppendOnlyMap and ExternalSorter (reduce side) are trying to max out the available execution memory. This in turn doesn't play nice with the Garbage Collector and executors are failing with OutOfMemoryError when the memory allocation from these in-memory structure is maxing out the available heap size (in our case we are running with 9 cores/executor, 32G per executor)\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, one can set `spark.shuffle.spill.numElementsForceSpillThreshold` to force the spill on disk. While this config works, it is not flexible enough as it's expressed in number of elements, and in our case we run multiple shuffles in a single job and element size is different from one stage to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the spill threshold behaviour and adds two new parameters to control the spill based on memory usage:\r\n\r\n- `spark.shuffle.spill.map.maxRecordsSizeForSpillThreshold`\r\n- `spark.shuffle.spill.reduce.maxRecordsSizeForSpillThreshold`\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- internal e2e testing using large jobs\r\nFirst, in our case for heavy RDD heavy shuffle jobs without setting the existing records based spill threshold (`spark.shuffle.spill.numElementsForceSpillThreshold`) the job in unstable and fails consistently with OOME in executors.\r\nTrying to find the right value for `numElementsForceSpillThreshold` proved to be impossible.\r\nTrying to maximize the job throughput (e.g. memory usage) while ensuring stability rendered to us an unbalanced usage across multiple stages of the job (in memory cached \"elements\" vary in size on map and reduce side combined with multiple map-reduce shuffles where \"elements\" are different)\r\nOverall the best we could get in terms of memory usage is depicted in this snapshot:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/728853/74935425-e526c080-53f0-11ea-8a2a-54c99ec2cef9.png)\r\n\r\nWorking from here, and using `spark.shuffle.spill.map.maxRecordsSizeForSpillThreshold` (map side, size-based spill) and `spark.shuffle.spill.numElementsForceSpillThreshold` (reduce side, size-based spill) we could maximize the memory usage (and in turn job runtime) while still keeping the job stable:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/728853/74935955-e2789b00-53f1-11ea-9c6f-5e7025bdf468.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Running existing unit-tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-15T22:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T10:16:19Z","closed_at":"2020-07-18T00:31:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cce35f27c7d531a3b94d85f1642db0eb9c1edbd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe details of the PR are explored in-depth in the sub-tasks of the umbrella jira SPARK-27726.\r\nBriefly:\r\n  1. Stop issuing asynchronous requests to cleanup elements in the tracking store when a request is already pending\r\n  2. Fix a couple of thread-safety issues (mutable state and mis-ordered updates)\r\n  3. Move Summary deletion outside of Stage deletion loop like Tasks already are\r\n  4. Reimplement multi-delete in a removeAllKeys call which allows InMemoryStore to implement it in a performant manner.\r\n  5. Some generic typing and exception handling cleanup\r\n\r\nWe see about five orders of magnitude improvement in the deletion code, which for us is the difference between a server that needs restarting daily, and one that is stable over weeks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the fire-once asynchronous code and the removeAll calls in both LevelDB and InMemoryStore are supplied.  It was noted that the testing code for the LevelDB and InMemoryStore is highly repetitive, and should probably be merged, but we did not attempt that in this PR.\r\n\r\nA version of this code was run in our production 2.3.3 and we were able to sustain higher throughput without going into GC overload (which was happening on a daily basis some weeks ago).\r\n\r\nA version of this code was also put

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded the driver functionality to get the resources. \r\n\r\nThe user interface is: SparkContext.resources  - I called it this to match the TaskContext.resources api proposed in the other PR. Originally it was going to be called SparkContext.getResources but changed to be consistent, if people have strong feelings I can change it. \r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways the driver can discover what resources it has. \r\n  1) user specifies a discoveryScript, this is similar to the executors and is meant for yarn and k8s where they don't tell you what you were allocated but you are running in isolated environment.\r\n  2) read the config spark.driver.resource.resourceName.addresses.  The config is meant to be used with standalone mode where the Worker will have to assign what GPU addresses the Driver is allowed to use by setting that config.\r\n\r\nWhen the user runs a spark application, if they want the driver to have GPU's they would specify the conf spark.driver.resource.gpu.count=X  where x is the number they want.  If they are running on yarn or k8s they will also have to specify the discoveryScript as specified above, if they are on standalone mode and cluster is setup properly they wouldn't have to specify anything else.  We could potentially get rid of the spark.driver.resources.gpu.addresses config which is really meant to be an internal config for worker to set if the standalone mode Worker wanted to write a discoveryScript out and set that for the user.  I'll wait for the jira that implements that to decide if we can remove.\r\n\r\n- This PR also has changes to be consistent about using resourceName everywhere.\r\n- change the config names from POSTFIX to SUFFIX to be more consistent with other areas in Spark\r\n- Moved the config checks around a bit since now used by both executor and driver. Note those might overlap a bit with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24374 so we will have to figure out which one should go in first.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests and manually test the interface.","created_at":"2019-05-15T17:55:30Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T18:50:49Z","closed_at":"2019-05-23T18:49:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b92d1207985e5aa3c56fbaa50e4b9e7cf85fb5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/768392ca83c29a2ef6b3ecb2d175cccd20ffa0ab","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-27488","ref":"SPARK-27488","sha":"768392ca83c29a2ef6b3ecb2d175cccd20ffa0ab","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn PySpark, `Row`'s `__from_dict__` is lost after pickle. But we rely on `__from_dict__` when converting `Row`s to internal by calling `toInternal`. It causes a weird behavior:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([Row(A=\"1\", B=\"2\")], \"B string, A string\").first()\r\nRow(B='2', A='1') # correct\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(spark.sparkContext.parallelize([Row(A=\"1\", B=\"2\")]), \"B string, A string\").first()\r\nRow(B='1', A='2') # incorrect

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe introduce offsets commit per micro-batch. Since we cannot commit at the executor side (a batch can be repeated) we need to do this at the driver side. A result of this is that we dont have offset metadata info to use.\r\nInspired by the Flink approach although Flink matches the continuous mode which the PR does not cover. Also Flink does a more sophisticated management of the kafka commits since it tracks commit progress at the task side via the flink-kafka-connector. For more details about this PR, pls check the jira ticket. \r\nA new option is introduced namely `setCommitOffsetsOnCheckpoints` to turn on/off this feature and also we expose metrics about successful/failed commits as in Flink (useful for monitoring).\r\n\r\nNote: this is used only for Kafka sources in streaming mode as written in the documentation.\r\nStreamingQueryManager enforces checkpointing in any case so we dont rely on the written back offsets in any way, unlike Flink which supports auto.commit when checkpointing is disabled. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually. Using spark shell.\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.Trigger\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\ncase class GeneratedData(key: String, value: String)\r\n  \r\nval df = spark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .format(\"kafka\")\r\n  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"/tmp/k4\")\r\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"localhost:9092\")\r\n  .option(\"subscribe\", \"Topic4\")\r\n  .option(\"startingOffsets\", \"latest\")\r\n  .option(\"setCommitOffsetsOnCheckpoints\", \"true\")\r\n  .option(\"maxOffsetsPerTrigger\", 100)\r\n  .option(\"setCommitOffsetsOnCheckpoints\", \"true\")\r\n  .load()\r\n\r\nval query = df.selectExpr(\"CAST(key AS STRING)\", \"CAST(value AS STRING)\")\r\n .as[GeneratedData]\r\n .writeStream\r\n .format(\"console\")\r\n .trigger(Trigger.ProcessingTime(\"5 seconds\"))\r\n\r\nquery.start()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n./kafka-console-consumer.sh  --formatter \"kafka.coordinator.group.GroupMetadataManager\\$OffsetsMessageFormatter\" --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic __consumer_offsets --from-beginning | grep spark\r\n\r\n[spark-kafka-source-b595f412-1ec6-408f-b804-6d44ae763340-348116533-driver-0,Topic4,0]::[OffsetMetadata[0,NO_METADATA],CommitTime 1557910170072,ExpirationTime 1557996570072]\r\n[spark-kafka-source-b595f412-1ec6-408f-b804-6d44ae763340-348116533-driver-0,Topic4,0]::[OffsetMetadata[1,NO_METADATA],CommitTime 1557910175019,ExpirationTime 1557996575019]\r\n[spark-kafka-source-b595f412-1ec6-408f-b804-6d44ae763340-348116533-driver-0,Topic4,0]::[OffsetMetadata[2,NO_METADATA],CommitTime 1557910180035,ExpirationTime 1557996580035]\r\n[spark-kafka-source-b595f412-1ec6-408f-b804-6d44ae763340-348116533-driver-0,Topic4,0]::[OffsetMetadata[6,NO_METADATA],CommitTime 1557910185014,ExpirationTime 1557996585014]\r\n[spark-kafka-source-b595f412-1ec6-408f-b804-6d44ae763340-348116533-driver-0,Topic4,0]::[OffsetMetadata[10,NO_METADATA],CommitTime 1557910190014,ExpirationTime 1557996590014]\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> -------------------------------------------\r\nBatch: 0\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|key|value|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n+---+-----+\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nBatch: 1\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n+----+------------+\r\n| key|       value|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nBatch: 2\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n+----+------------+\r\n| key|       value|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nBatch: 3\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n+----+------------+\r\n| key|       value|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nBatch: 4\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n+----+------------+\r\n| key|       value|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nBatch: 5\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n+----+------------+\r\n| key|       value|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n|null|Hello, World|\r\n+----+------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe last batch commit reported 10 as the offset, while the maximum in this case is 13, reason is that [MicroBatchExecution](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/MicroBatchExecution.scala#L416) will only commit the previously completed batch offsets when a new batch is going to be processed. We do care about the committed ones so we dont report back something not done as seen by the engine (users can always compare with max offset if they care about the lag here).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the jdbc datasource,  we can save a rdd to the database.\r\n\r\nThe comments for the function `saveTable` is that.\r\n\r\n      /**\r\n       * Saves the RDD to the database in a single transaction.\r\n       */\r\n      def saveTable(\r\n          df: DataFrame,\r\n          tableSchema: Option[StructType],\r\n          isCaseSensitive: Boolean,\r\n          options: JdbcOptionsInWrite)\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is not correct.\r\n\r\n The  savePartition operation is in a single transaction but  the saveTable operation is not in a single transaction.\r\n\r\nThere are several cases of data transmission:\r\n\r\n- case1: Append data to origin existed gptable.\r\n- case2: Overwrite origin gptable, but the table is a cascadingTruncateTable, so we can not drop the gptable, we have to truncate it and append data.\r\n- case3: Overwrite origin existed table and the table is not a cascadingTruncateTable, so we can drop it first.\r\n- case4: For an unexisted table, create and transmit data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add a transactions support for case3 and case4.\r\n\r\nFor case3 and case4,  we can transmit the rdd to a temp table at first.\r\n\r\nWe use an accumulator to record the suceessful savePartition operations.\r\n\r\nAt last, we compare the value of accumulator with dataFrame's partitionNum.\r\n\r\nIf all the savePartition operations are successful,  we drop the origin table if it exists,  then we  alter the temp table rename to origin table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2019-05-15T06:11:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-19T02:03:59Z","closed_at":"2019-06-19T02:03:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4f978ea8fe6a9f1fe737e20bbeb9b3a816252cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6f5a686923dc4a39fe20ed16c3a8a95066248fd","head":{"label":"turboFei:SPARK-27716","ref":"SPARK-27716","sha":"d6f5a686923dc4a39fe20ed16c3a8a95066248fd","user":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77131854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzEzMTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"turboFei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen there is a `Union`, the reported output datatypes are the ones of the first plan and the nullability is updated according to all the plans. For complex types, though, the nullability of their elements is not updated using the types from the other plans. This means that the nullability of the inner elements is the one of the first plan. If this is not compatible with the one of other plans, errors can happen (as reported in the JIRA).\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to update the nullability of the inner elements of complex datatypes according to most permissive value of all the plans.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo allow alternatives to serviceaccounts\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAlthough we provide some authentication configuration, such as spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.mounted.oauthTokenFile, spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.mounted.caCertFile, etc. \r\nBut there is a bug as we forced the service account so when we use one of them, driver still use the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_PATH file, and the error look like bellow:\r\n\r\nthe KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_PATH serviceAccount not exists\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes user can now use `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.mounted.caCertFile`\r\nor token file by `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.mounted.oauthTokenFile` \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually passed the certificates using `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.mounted.caCertFile`\r\nor token file by `spark.kubernetes.authenticate.driver.mounted.oauthTokenFile` if there is no default service account

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`NestedColumnAliasing` rule covers `GetStructField` only, currently. It means that some nested field extraction expressions aren't pruned. For example, if only accessing a nested field in an array of struct (`GetArrayStructFields`), this column isn't pruned.\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the rule to cover general nested field cases, including `GetArrayStructFields`.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.","created_at":"2019-05-14T10:09:29Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:36:30Z","closed_at":"2019-06-12T03:17:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f68e1197591b3a1b8775b95e2dd525ac28d7cb94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3aab8bf953fab5e26ebe83f252efb63a9a10d469","head":{"label":"viirya:nested-pruning-extract-value","ref":"nested-pruning-extract-value","sha":"3aab8bf953fab5e26ebe83f252efb63a9a10d469","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, in `ParquetFilters` and `OrcFilters`, if the child predicate of `Or` operator can't be entirely pushed down, the predicates will be thrown away. \r\nIn fact, the conjunctive predicates under `Or` operators can be partially pushed down.\r\nFor example, says `a` and `b` are convertible, while `c` can't be pushed down, the predicate\r\n`a or (b and c)` \r\ncan be converted as \r\n`(a or b) and (a or c)`\r\nWe can still push down `(a or b)`.\r\nWe can't push down disjunctive predicates only when one of its children is not partially convertible.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improve the filter pushing down logic in `DataSourceV2Strategy`. With partial filter push down in `Or` operator, the result of `pushedFilters()` might not exist in the mapping `translatedFilterToExpr`.  To fix it, this PR changes the mapping `translatedFilterToExpr` as leaf filter expression to `sources.filter`, and later on rebuild the whole expression with the mapping.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo return accurate pushed filters in Parquet file scan(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24327#pullrequestreview-234775673), we can process the original data source filters in the following way:\r\n1. For \"And\" operators, split the conjunctive predicates and try converting each of them. After that\r\n1.1 if partially predicate pushed down is allowed, return convertible results; \r\n1.2 otherwise, return the whole predicate if convertible, or empty result if not convertible.\r\n\r\n2. For \"Or\" operators, if both children can be  pushed down, it is partially or totally convertible; otherwise, return empty result\r\n\r\n3. For other operators, they are not able to be partially pushed down. \r\n2.1 if the entire predicate is convertible, return itself\r\n2.2 otherwise, return an empty result.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains code refactoring. Currently `ParquetFilters. createFilter ` accepts parameter `schema: MessageType` and create field mapping for every input filter. We can make it a class member and avoid creating the `nameToParquetField` mapping for every input filter.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the existing code, a broadcast execution timeout for the Future only causes a query failure, but the job running with the broadcast and the computation in the Future are not canceled. This wastes resources and slows down the other jobs. This PR tries to cancel both the running job and the running hashed relation construction thread.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new test suite

\r\nDeterministic UDF is a udf for which the following is true:  Given a specific input, the output of the udf will be the same no matter how many times you execute the udf.\r\n\r\nWhen your inputs to the UDF are all literal and UDF is deterministic, we can optimize this to evaluate the udf once and use the output instead of evaluating the UDF each time for every row in the query. \r\n\r\nThis is valid only if the UDF is deterministic and inputs are literal.  Otherwise we should not and cannot apply this optimization. \r\n\r\nChanges: \r\n- Add a new optimizer rule to evaluate the ScalaUDF once if it is deterministic and the inputs are literals.  \r\n\r\nTesting: \r\n- Added new unit tests\r\n\r\nCredits: \r\nThanks to [Guy Khazma](https://github.com/guykhazma) from the IBM Haifa Research Team for the idea and the original implementation.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis replaces use of collection classes like `MutableList` and `ArrayStack` with workalikes that are available in 2.12, as they will be removed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark uses FileStatusCache to cache the listings while scanning a filesystem path. If this file system is on a remote storage like Object store (Amazon s3 or IBM COS), then this cache is of prime importance as it saves round trips of fetching listing over network over and over again.\r\n\r\nFileStatusCache uses guava cache underneath, which is configured with reasonably high default value. But, when remote listing is large >100K, the size requirement of this cache is also very high. Currently, this underlying guava cache is configured with default concurrency level of 4. The effect of this is, that a single entry can only be as large as less than `maxSizeOfCache/concurrencyLevel` [1]. Quite often, users have everything listed under a single directory or path on an object store, and as a result the entire fileStatus array containing 100k + entries is inserted as a single entry in the cache. So cache requirement grows more than 4x. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Jira [link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27664) for more detailed explanation. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, we make default concurrency level for underlying guava cache as 1 and makes it configurable, as this cache stores only a few but very large entries in reality. So the performance penalty will be very less, if any.\r\n\r\nI am open to work on an alternative solution as well, please feel free to discuss them.\r\n\r\n[1]. https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3462 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should pass.\r\nManually verified the expected behaviour against a path with large listing ~

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n__Targeted for branch 2.4, #24585__\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark uses FileStatusCache to cache the listings while scanning a filesystem path. If this file system is on a remote storage like Object store (Amazon s3 or IBM COS), then this cache is of prime importance as it saves round trips of fetching listing over network over and over again.\r\n\r\nFileStatusCache uses guava cache underneath, which is configured with reasonably high default value. But, when remote listing is large >100K, the size requirement of this cache is also very high. Currently, this underlying guava cache is configured with default concurrency level of 4. The effect of this is, that a single entry can only be as large as less than `maxSizeOfCache/concurrencyLevel` [1]. Quite often, users have everything listed under a single directory or path on an object store, and as a result the entire fileStatus array containing 100k + entries is inserted as a single entry in the cache. So cache requirement grows more than 4x. \r\n\r\nPlease refer to Jira [link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27664) for more detailed explanation. \r\n\r\nIn this patch, we make default concurrency level for underlying guava cache as 1 and makes it configurable, as this cache stores only a few but very large entries in reality. So the performance penalty will be very less, if any.\r\n\r\nI am open to work on an alternative solution as well, please feel free to discuss them.\r\n\r\n[1]. https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3462 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should pass.\r\nManually verified the expected behaviour against a path with large listing ~

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`HiveThriftServer2` is a multi-session managed service based on `HiveServer2`, which provides centralized management services for Hive.\r\n\r\nSince `HiveThriftServer2` itself inherits from `HiveServer2`, `HiveServer2`'s own HA solution can also support `HiveThriftServer2`.\r\n\r\n`HiveThriftServer2` does not support **HA**. Why is this?\r\n\r\nThe main method of `HiveServer2` is as follows:\r\n```\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    HiveConf.setLoadHiveServer2Config(true);\r\n    try {\r\n      ServerOptionsProcessor oproc = new ServerOptionsProcessor(\"hiveserver2\");\r\n      ServerOptionsProcessorResponse oprocResponse = oproc.parse(args);\r\n \r\n      // Omit irrelevant code\r\n \r\n      // Call the executor which will execute the appropriate command based on the parsed options\r\n      oprocResponse.getServerOptionsExecutor().execute();\r\n    } catch (LogInitializationException e) {\r\n      LOG.error(\"Error initializing log: \" + e.getMessage(), e);\r\n      System.exit(-1);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe above code first creates the `ServerOptionsProcessor` object and parses the parameters. The `parse` method parses the parameters and returns the `oprocResponse` object (type is `ServerOptionsProcessorResponse`). Then the object obtained by calling the `getServerOptionsExecutor` method of `oprocResponse` is actually `StartOptionExecutor`. Finally, the execute method of `StartOptionExecutor` is called. The implementation of StartOptionExecutor is as follows:\r\n```\r\n  static class StartOptionExecutor implements ServerOptionsExecutor {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void execute() {\r\n      try {\r\n        startHiveServer2();\r\n      } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n        LOG.fatal(\"Error starting HiveServer2\", t);\r\n        System.exit(-1);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIt can be seen that the `execute` method of `StartOptionExecutor` actually calls the `startHiveServer2` method, and the code related to HA in the `startHiveServer2` method is as follows:\r\n```\r\n        if (hiveConf.getBoolVar(ConfVars.HIVE_SERVER2_SUPPORT_DYNAMIC_SERVICE_DISCOVERY)) {\r\n          server.addServerInstanceToZooKeeper(hiveConf);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nYou can see that the `addServerInstanceToZooKeeper` method of `HiveServer2` is called. The role of the `addServerInstanceToZooKeeper` is to create a persistent parent node as the HA namespace on the specified `ZooKeeper` cluster, and create a persistent node to save the `HiveServer2` instance information to the node.\r\n\r\nBut `HiveThriftServer2` can not call the `execute` method of `StartOptionExecutor` as Spark has its own logic. So I added some reflection code as to call the `addServerInstanceToZooKeeper` method of `HiveServer2`.\r\n\r\n**Notice**:This PR can support Hive version as follows:\r\n0.14.0 through 2.3.4\r\n3.1.0 through 3.1.1\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExists

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, DataFrameWriter.save() does a large amount of ad-hoc work (e.g., loading data source classes, validating options, and so on) before executing the command.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this code falls outside the scope of any SQL execution, which is unfortunate since it means it's untracked by Spark (e.g., in the Spark UI), and also means df.write ops cannot be manipulated by custom catalyst rules prior to execution.\r\n\r\nThese issues can be largely resolved by creating a command that represents df.write.save/saveAsTable(), which also is nice since it simplifies the code a bit.\r\n\r\ncc @gatorsmile @srinathshankar \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should still

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Standalone HA Background\r\n\r\nIn Spark Standalone HA mode, we'll have multiple masters running at the same time. But, there's only one master leader, which actively serving scheduling requests. Once this master leader crashes, other masters would compete for the leader and only one master is guaranteed to be elected as new master leader, which would reconstruct the state from the original master leader and continute to serve scheduling requests. \r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\n#2828 firstly introduces the bug of *duplicate Worker registration*, and #3447 fixed it. But there're still corner cases(see SPARK-23191 for details) where #3447 can not cover it:\r\n\r\n* CASE 1\r\n(1) Initially, Worker registered with Master A.\r\n(2) After a while, the connection channel between Master A and Worker becomes inactive(e.g. due to network drop), and Worker is notified about that by calling `onDisconnected` from NettyRpcEnv\r\n(3) When Worker invokes `onDisconnected`, then, it will attempt to reconnect to all masters(including Master A)\r\n(4) At the meanwhile, network between Worker and Master A recover,  Worker successfully register to Master A again\r\n(5) Master A response with `RegisterWorkerFailed(\"Duplicate worker ID\")`\r\n(6) Worker receives that msg, exit\r\n\r\n* CASE 2\r\n(1) Master A lost leadership(sends `RevokedLeadership` to itself). Master B takes over and recovery everything from master A(which would  register workers for the first time in Master B) and sends `MasterChanged` to Worker\r\n(2) Before Master A receives `RevokedLeadership`, it receives a late `HeartBeat` from Worker(which had been removed in Master A due to heartbeat timeout previously), so it sends `ReconnectWorker`  to worker\r\n(3) Worker receives `MasterChanged` before `ReconnectWorker` , changing masterRef to Master B\r\n(4) Subsequently, Worker receives `ReconnectWorker` from Master A, then it reconnects to all masters\r\n(5) Master B receives register request again from the Worker,  response with `RegisterWorkerFailed(\"Duplicate worker ID\")`\r\n(6) Worker receives that msg, exit\r\n\r\nIn CASE 1, it is difficult for the Worker to know Master A's state. Normally, Worker thinks Master A has already died and is impossible that Master A would response with Worker's re-connect request.\r\n \r\nIn CASE 2, we can see race condition between `RevokedLeadership` and `HeartBeat`. Actually, Master A has already been revoked leadership while processing `HeartBeat` msg. That's means the state between Master and Zookeeper could be out of sync for a while. \r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nIn this PR, instead of exiting Worker process when *duplicate Worker registration* happens, we suggest to log warn about it. This would be fine since Master actually perform no-op when it receives duplicate registration from a Worker. In turn, Worker could continue living with that Master normally without any side effect.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested Manually.\r\n\r\nI followed the steps as  Neeraj Gupta suggested in JIRA SPARK-23191 to reproduce the case 1.\r\n\r\nBefore this pr, Worker would be DEAD from UI.\r\nAfter this pr, Worker just warn the duplicate register behavior (as you can see the second last row in log snippet below), and still be ALIVE from UI.\r\n\r\n```\r\n19/05/09 20:58:32 ERROR Worker: Connection to master failed!

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe below example works with both Mysql and Hive, however not with spark.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmysql> select * from date_test where date_col >= '2000-1-1';\r\n+------------+\r\n| date_col   |\r\n+------------+\r\n| 2000-01-01 |\r\n+------------+\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that Spark casts both sides to String type during date and string comparison for partial date support. Please find more details in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8420.\r\n\r\nBased on some tests, the behavior of Date and String comparison in Hive and Mysql:\r\nHive: Cast to Date, partial date is not supported\r\nMysql: Cast to Date, certain \"partial date\" is supported by defining certain date string parse rules. Check out str_to_datetime in https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/5.5/sql-common/my_time.c\r\n\r\nAs below date patterns have been supported, the PR is to cast string to date when comparing string and date:\r\n```\r\n`yyyy`\r\n`yyyy-[m]m`\r\n`yyyy-[m]m-[d]d`\r\n`yyyy-[m]m-[d]d `\r\n`yyyy-[m]m-[d]d *`\r\n`yyyy-[m]m-[d]dT*\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUT has been

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs the current approach in OneForOneBlockFetcher, we reuse the OpenBlocks protocol to describe the fetch request for shuffle blocks, and it causes the extension work for shuffle fetching like #19788 and #24110 very awkward.\r\nIn this PR, we split the fetch request for shuffle blocks from OpenBlocks which named FetchShuffleBlocks. It's a loose bind with ShuffleBlockId and can easily extend by adding new fields in this protocol.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting and new added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAn  optimization for joins on a condition of `arrays_overlap`. I believe this worthwhile to integrate into Spark due to the recent release of several new array functions in Spark 2.4. This optimization will allow\r\nusers to make better use of the arrays overlap function. The technique proposed in the patch can also be trivially extended to joins with a condition involving `array_contains`.\r\n\r\nThe following code will produce a cartesian product in the physical plans.\r\n```scala\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\nval a = Seq((Seq(1, 2, 3), \"one\")).toDF(\"num\", \"name\")\r\nval b = Seq((Seq(1, 5), \"two\")).toDF(\"num\", \"name\")\r\nval j = a.join(b, arrays_overlap(b(\"num\"), a(\"num\")))\r\nj.explain(true)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\nJoin Inner, arrays_overlap(num#158, num#149)\r\n:- Project [_1#146 AS num#149, _2#147 AS name#150]\r\n:  +- LocalRelation [_1#146, _2#147]\r\n+- Project [_1#155 AS num#158, _2#156 AS name#159]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [_1#155,

by:\r\n1. exploding the arrays\r\n2. joining on the exploded columns\r\n3. dropping the exploded columns on the joined data\r\n4. removing duplicates from the result of 3)\r\n\r\nDoing so will bring a

tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch has only been tested via manual tests on a large dataset.\r\nI've used the technique implemented by this patch to perform similar joins with ~300 million records on either side of the join. If you agree that this is a worthwhile optimization, I'll happily contribute some unit tests to ensure the robustness of the optimization.","created_at":"2019-05-09T00:55:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T00:06:30Z","closed_at":"2019-12-31T00:06:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5671d5037d451d9ab122d2e8877ec66db7f3d2a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605297,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1Mjk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/OPTIMIZER","name":"OPTIMIZER","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14b1ddf2b73d2339b7618ece4f4a18020acbb4d8","head":{"label":"nvander1:feature/optimize_array_joins","ref":"feature/optimize_array_joins","sha":"14b1ddf2b73d2339b7618ece4f4a18020acbb4d8","user":{"login":"nvander1","id":11447895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ3ODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11447895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1","html_url":"https://github.com/nvander1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvander1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"78a403fab92c263937e96a1673cf5edce7a8185d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new API for catalog plugins that exposes functions to Spark. The API can list and load functions. This does not include create, delete, or alter operations.\r\n- [Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLBieHIlxZjmoUB0ERF-VozCRJ0xw2j3qKvUNWpWA2U/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nThere are 3 types of functions defined:\r\n* A `ScalarFunction` that produces a value for every call\r\n* An `AggregateFunction` that produces a value after updates for a group of rows\r\n\r\nFunctions loaded from the catalog by name as `UnboundFunction`. Once input arguments are determined `bind` is called on the unbound function to get a `BoundFunction` implementation that is one of the 3 types above. Binding can fail if the function doesn't support the input type. `BoundFunction` returns the result type produced by the function.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis includes a test that demonstrates the new API.","created_at":"2019-05-08T17:40:46Z","updated_at":"2022-02-05T19:46:40Z","closed_at":"2021-04-07T09:19:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2add274e0e512d238358107ff963e8839b93b55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bb8f2aa2181ff3270b91d6f15f05e4197f13df32","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-27658-add-function-catalog-api","ref":"SPARK-27658-add-function-catalog-api","sha":"bb8f2aa2181ff3270b91d6f15f05e4197f13df32","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

and hive behaves differently If 'EXTERNAL' keyword is been used in CREATE command, only then the table will be considered as external,\r\nelse it will be managed. this behavior is making below mentioned use-cases getting blocked.\r\n\r\nusecase 1: user will not able to set an external location for a managed table.\r\nusecase 2: compatibility issue with hive/impala which also cause problems in job migrations to spark.\r\nThe changes here i am proposing is when user creates table without 'External' keyword like below\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ext2 (name STRING) LOCATION 'D:/spark-2.4.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-warehouse/abc_orc13'\"\"\")\r\n\r\nspark shall create a managed table which can refer any location specified by user and able to delete the metadata/data of user on drop table command similar to hive and impala system .\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUT and also tested manually.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-08T15:36:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T16:28:27Z","closed_at":"2019-05-13T16:28:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21658aa0f3d3ca65cc3a5b3162e0dd7c2a751cf1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/091a4c5da55d93ca38a70d77e1a6856b6f13e234","head":{"label":"sujith71955:master_location","ref":"master_location","sha":"091a4c5da55d93ca38a70d77e1a6856b6f13e234","user":{"login":"sujith71955","id":12999161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12999161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955","html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79292929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTI5MjkyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sujith71955/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sujith71955","id":12999161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTk5MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12999161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955","html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujith71955/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sujith71955/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR during fetching a disk persisted RDD block the network was always used to get the requested block content even when both the source and fetcher executor was running on the same host.\r\n\r\nThe idea to access another executor local disk files by directly reading the disk comes from the external shuffle service where the local dirs are stored for each executor (block manager).\r\n\r\nTo make this possible the following changes are done:\r\n- `RegisterBlockManager` message is extended with the `localDirs` which is stored by the block manager master for each block manager as a new property of the `BlockManagerInfo`\r\n- `GetLocationsAndStatus` is extended with the requester host\r\n- `BlockLocationsAndStatus` (the reply for `GetLocationsAndStatus` message) is extended with the an option of local directories, which is filled with a local directories of a same host executor (if there is any, otherwise None is used). This is where the block content can be read from.\r\n\r\nShuffle blocks are out of scope of this PR: there will be a separate PR opened for that (for another Jira issue). \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith a new unit test in `BlockManagerSuite`. See the the test prefixed by \"SPARK-27622: avoid the network when block requested from same host\".","created_at":"2019-05-08T08:27:58Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T20:59:06Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T14:40:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7159a37cf961f13f567569bdb4d1f0fa0292e61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607284,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3Mjg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BLOCK%20MANAGER","name":"BLOCK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves `ConstantPropagation` rule, the new implementation:\r\n- Collects constants into a map directly, instead of a list that is then transformed into a map.\r\n- Supports substituting in conflicting equalities:\r\n  e.g. `a = 1 AND a = 2` => `a = 1 AND 1 = 2`\r\n  Before this PR this unsatisfiable filter was not reduced:\r\n  ```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  *(1) Project [value#219 AS a#222]\r\n  +- *(1) Filter ((isnotnull(value#219) AND (value#219 = 1)) AND (value#219 = 2))\r\n     +- *(1) LocalTableScan [value#219]\r\n  ```\r\n  But after this PR it is:\r\n  ```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  LocalTableScan <empty>, [a#222]\r\n  ```\r\n- Extends propagation from attribute => constant mapping to deterministic expression => constant mapping:\r\n  e.g. `abs(a) = 5 AND b = abs(a) + 3` => `abs(a) = 5 AND b = 8`\r\n- Allows substitution in other than `EqualTo` and `EqualNullSafe` expressions:\r\n  e.g. `a = 5 AND b < a + 3` => `a = 5 AND b < 8`\r\n- Allows propagation of constant non-nullable expressions in `Project` and other nodes (except for `Join`):\r\n  e.g. `SELECT a = 5 AND b = a + 3` => `SELECT a = 5 AND b = 8`\r\n  Before this PR only `Filter` was supported.\r\n- Allows deep constant propagation:\r\n  e.g. `... WHERE IF(..., a = 5 AND b = a + 3, ...)` => `... WHERE IF(..., a = 5 AND b = 8, ...)`\r\n  Before this PR only top level `And`/`Or`/`Not` nodes were supported.\r\n- During expression tree traversal tracks a boolean context that controls if constant propagation of a nullable expression can be safely applied. \r\n  - E.g. in the case of `... WHERE a = c AND f(a)` or `IF(a = c AND f(a), ..., ...)` where `a` is a nullable expression and `c` is a constant the `null` result of `a = c AND f(a)` means the same as if it resulted `false` therefore constant propagation can be safely applied (`a = c AND f(a)` => `a = c AND f(c)`).\r\n  - In the case of `SELECT a = c AND f(a)` the `null` result really means `null`. In this context constant propagation can't be applied safely.\r\n  - There is also a 3rd context due to an enclosing `Not` in which the context flips. E.g. constant propagation can't be applied on `WHERE NOT(a = c AND f(a))` but can be again on `WHERE NOT(IF(..., NOT(a = c AND f(a)), ...)`.\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove performance.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-08T07:02:25Z","updated_at":"2020-05-25T00:26:37Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T00:26:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae4691c683cf71abe89c9327a408a81e966c9097","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d994abcf76b6ee48e8d6dd635a894b931bf8725","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-27604-enhanced-constant-propagation","ref":"SPARK-27604-enhanced-constant-propagation","sha":"6d994abcf76b6ee48e8d6dd635a894b931bf8725","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

We need to join many times from different tables, but the statistics of some tables are incorrect. So this job need 43 min. It only need 3.7 min after `set spark.sql.statistics.persistentStatsAfterFallBack=true`. But the newly calculated statistics just for this SparkSession.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nadded the missing config for structured streaming when using file source.\r\n\r\nfrom the code we have \r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Maximum age of a file that can be found in this directory, before it is ignored. For the\r\n   * first batch all files will be considered valid. If `latestFirst` is set to `true` and\r\n   * `maxFilesPerTrigger` is set, then this parameter will be ignored, because old files that are\r\n   * valid, and should be processed, may be ignored. Please refer to SPARK-19813 for details.\r\n   *\r\n   * The max age is specified with respect to the timestamp of the latest file, and not the\r\n   * timestamp of the current system. That this means if the last file has timestamp 1000, and the\r\n   * current system time is 2000, and max age is 200, the system will purge files older than\r\n   * 800 (rather than 1800) from the internal state.\r\n   *\r\n   * Default to a week.\r\n   */\r\n  val maxFileAgeMs: Long =\r\n    Utils.timeStringAsMs(parameters.getOrElse(\"maxFileAge\", \"7d\"))\r\n```\r\nwhich is not documented. \r\n\r\nalso the file processing order was not mentioned but in the code we specifically select the file list based on file mtime: \r\n```scala\r\nprivate val fileSortOrder = if (sourceOptions.latestFirst) {\r\n      logWarning(\r\n        \"\"\"'latestFirst' is true.
