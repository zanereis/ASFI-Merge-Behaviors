This is causing problem when HDFS being very slow / parallel runner hitting CPU bounded on working on workunit persistency that Helix task is activated before WU is showing up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Once it is being resolved and added as part of `JobContext`, the `Source` will be added with this job properties so as passing-down to each workunits. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Unit tested in `LocalJobLauncher`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-925\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently, Gobblin containers `tail -F` a file to output logs.\r\nWhile this works, this means that the container will not stop execution if the java process is terminated. This becomes problematic when Kubernetes uses container status to restart pods.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a flag variable to the startup script so that containers can read console directly by running the gobblin executable in the foreground \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nscripts change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-843\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\ncurrently, the admin UI & rest server starts and clubbed within the master process ( standalone, or cluster master/worker process ).\r\n\r\nIf we can have ability to start the rest server and admin UI separately, it would help manage it better and decouple the deployment modes and admin/rest services.\r\n\r\nthe gobblin service command should facilitate starting stopping admin/rest services.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: adding more way to start admin server, no new code functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-921] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-921\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn pull mode, register will first try to check if the partition has already existed to reduce the call to add_partition. In push mode, register will try to call add_partition directly and relying on the exception to determine whether existed which mode should be used when most of the partition the HiveRegister try to register is not existed to reduce the call to HiveMetaStore.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest on cluster\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-918] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-918\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nADFPipelineExecutionTask is an example implementation of AbstractADFPipelineExecutionTask which can execute an Azure Data Factory pipeline. It has the following two abstract methods implementation:\r\n* It gets pipeline parameters from the configuration - azure.data-factory.pipeline.params\r\n* It gets the authenticate through Azure Active Directory based on the service principal's id and secret\r\nThe ADFPipelineExecutionTask first gets the token and caches it using CachedAADAuthenticator, then it calls the REST endpoint constructed via ADFPipelineExecutionUriBuilder with the payload constructed from a JSON string.\r\nThe ADFPipelineExecutionTask entends the HttpExecutionTask, which a general task class that can handle REST calls\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCachedAADAuthenticatorTest\r\nADFPipelineExecutionTaskTest\r\nADFPipelineExecutionUriBuilderTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-905\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently Gobblin Standalone crashes when adding a new `.job` file to `GOBBLIN_JOB_CONF_DIR`. Bug reproduction steps and output is outlined in the Jira ticket.\r\n\r\nBug was caused by `JobSpecResolver` being null when `PathAlterationListenerAdaptorForMonitor` is instantiated. Fix moved the assignment of `JobSpecResolver` to be before the instantiation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-904\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, we recreate a Helix cluster structure everytime a Gobblin-on-Yarn application is launched. This is an expensive operation and somewhat flaky, often requiring multiple attempts. We need the ability to overwrite an existing Helix cluster to provide deterministic restarts. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest deployment. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-898\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nwe came across this code snippet which registers jobListner for JobCompleteTimer and JobSucceededTimer event and looks like JobSucceededTimer event calls onJobFailure function instead of onJobSucced function.\r\n\r\nnotifyListeners(this.jobContext, jobListener, TimingEvent.LauncherTimings.JOB_SUCCEEDED, new JobListenerAction() {\r\n@Override\r\npublic void apply(JobListener jobListener, JobContext jobContext)\r\nthrows Exception\r\n\r\n{ jobListener.onJobFailure(jobContext); }\r\n});\r\nQinghe from our team found this, so reporting on behalf of him here\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: its a bugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-894\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThis change allows GaaS to combine datasets using a glob pattern. Classes changed:\r\n- Modify flow `MultiHopFlowCompiler` to set subpath config in the flow spec if combining is specified\r\n- Modify `FSDatasetDescriptor` to concatenate subpaths with base path and check each against a glob pattern\r\n- Modify `FSFlowTemplateCatalog` to not resolve config until later (this is unnecessary and causes issues with optional configs)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-881\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWith multi-dataset support in gaas, it is more convenient to have an extra field that can be used to filter when querying the job status (this would be dataset name in most cases).\r\n\r\nThis PR allows jobs to include `job.tag` field then when querying jobStatus, specifying tag in the query will return only job statuses with that tag.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

newer version like 2.7.6) and associated configs\r\n    2 - TTL  implementation\r\n      * Added configs to allow setting a TTL (documentTTL) and also specify the timeunits (documentTTLUnits) of these settings\r\n      * Added logic to specify the path to key to the field containing the source timestamp (documentTTLOriginField) and its units (documentTTLOriginUnits) to disambiguate between UNIX (sec) timestamps and other formats like timestamps in milliseconds.\r\n    3 - Added missing dnsSrv config\r\n    4 - Written proper documentation on gobblin-docs/writers/CouchbaseWriter.md\r\n    5 -

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-882#\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently the script `./gobblin-service.sh start` fails to start the service. My changes modify the configuration to have the service running and accepting API calls minimally directly off the script.\r\n\r\nAfter building the project, GaaS should be able to run directly with the script `./bin/gobblin-service.sh start`.\r\n\r\nIf the script complains about the templateCatalog path not existing, set it to wherever the templates are stored locally or create a folder in `/tmp/templateCatalog`\r\n\r\nThe JobStatusMonitor is disabled in the config for now to get the service running but will work on finding a way to have that running too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-12T22:02:34Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T23:58:52Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T20:21:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fff21bba4d197ba65d6b587b41f04a5879cd0fd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ade00a7c846097c5725bb8b891cc4d1d4170ed57","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:wlo/fix-gaas-config","ref":"wlo/fix-gaas-config","sha":"ade00a7c846097c5725bb8b891cc4d1d4170ed57","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-877\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nPreviously, we remove the schema.literal for partition.  Because Avro schemas should only be defined at the table level. Hive overrides table properties if the same property is defined on the partition. Defining them at the partition level may lead to partitions with inconsistent schemas. And because column metadata is calculated from schema.literal, so we remove the column metadata as well.\r\n\r\nThen we encounter a problem that presto cannot read data from orc file. Because ORC (and other Hive serdes) need metadata in the partitions so that coercion can be done between a partition schema and the table schema.\r\n\r\nSo we need to treat Avro and other formate separately to make sure hive registration works well so that user can read right data from Presto.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest on dataset written in orc format and I can read data from presto \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-865\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn SFDC(salesforce) connector, we have partitioning mechanisms to split a giant query to multiple sub queries. There are 3 mechanisms:\r\n\r\nsimple partition (equally split by time)\r\ndynamic pre-partition (generate histogram and split by row numbers)\r\nuser specified partition (set up time range in job file)\r\nHowever there are tables like Task and Contract are failing time to time to fetch full data.\r\n\r\nWe may want to utilize PK-chunking to partition the query.\r\n\r\nThe pk-chunking doc from SFDC - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/async_api_headers_enable_pk_chunking.htm\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- In Source, execute the giant query with PK-Chunking and partition to workUnits\r\n  - Create a state with all PK-chunking arguments \r\n  - Instantiate an extractor with the state\r\n  - Call extractor function to execute the giant query\r\n  - we would get a list of result IDs.\r\n  - generate a list of workUnit( one workUnit contains a slice of the result ID list)\r\n- In extractor, execute the workUnit to fetch resultset\r\n  - identify the workUnit whether it is for pk chunking\r\n  - if not, keep run as before (using the existing 3 partition)\r\n  - if yes, just fetch resultset files by the result id list.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-29T01:26:26Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T06:13:59Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T06:13:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c6ed3a9a49edfbefb1e04e65b85135b0763c699","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7d17db02b97096fd5518c2267a294f29272f9f73","head":{"label":"arekusuri:GOBBLIN-865-pk-chunking-partition","ref":"GOBBLIN-865-pk-chunking-partition","sha":"7d17db02b97096fd5518c2267a294f29272f9f73","user":{"login":"arekusuri","id":536496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjQ5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri","html_url":"https://github.com/arekusuri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205043227,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDUwNDMyMjc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"arekusuri/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arekusuri","id":536496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjQ5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri","html_url":"https://github.com/arekusuri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arekusuri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arekusuri/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-863\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen updating the hive table, lock the table and fetch the latest schema from schema registry and use the latest schema to update table to make sure the table always has the latest schema\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest streaming job to see hive registration work as expected. And fetching latest latest schema may cost 0.05~0.15 second. But this should not happen frequently, only happen when there if new partition or schema change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-860\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nProcess flow-level events for flow status instead of computing it based on job-level events. In more detail:\r\n- Modify FS and Mysql job retriever to return all job states (including the flow level one) instead of filtering that one out\r\n- Modify flow status resource to read flow state instead of computing from job states\r\n- Add `FLOW_RUNNING` event sent by `DagManager`\r\n- Modify job status monitor to accept these flow level events\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-851\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe had problems when table level schema and partition level schema diverges. Think about the case when user register two partitions : 2019/08/10, 2019/08/11, but schema changes in between(S1->S2). Now the table level has schema S2, but 2019/08/10 will have schema S1. \r\n\r\nQuery on the latest schema will cause the old partition failure.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   Unit tests in gobblin-hive-registration module.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-846\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis task enhances LogCopier service to perform continuous log aggregation for long-running Gobblin-on-Yarn applications. It periodically copies rolled container logs to a specified location on HDFS. The \"current\" log file is copied in the end as part of the service shutdown sequence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests in LogCopierTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-839\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIf a template throws RuntimeException during resolution when GaaS is started, the exception will be caught and the edge will just not be added to the graph. However if GaaS is already started then a template is changed to something that won't resolve, then every job will fail to start due to not handling the exception.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nReproduced issue locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Reconstruct the `zipTestStore.zip` by adding `testVersion` layer after `_CONFIG_STORE`. \r\n- Refactoring `ConfigStoreUtils` by adding `getListOfTopicNamesByFilteringTag ` where address code duplication problem. Adding unit tests for `ConfigStoreUtils` to make sure the behavior is the same before and after refactoring. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.
