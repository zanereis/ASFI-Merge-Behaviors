What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new field in QueryTerminatedEvent about \"error class\" if the information exists in the exception. Note that it doesn't retrieve the information from StreamingQueryException, because it is marked as it's own error class and we want to know the causing exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCustom streaming query listeners can get the \"categorized\" error as cause of the query termination, which can be used to determine trends of the errors, aggregation, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users having customer streaming query listener will have additional information in termination event.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupports struct type in `createDataFrame` from pandas DataFrame.\r\n\r\nWith Arrow optimization, it works without the fallback:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import Row\r\n>>>\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame(\r\n...     {\"a\": [Row(1, \"a\"), Row(2, \"b\")], \"b\": [{\"s\": 3, \"t\": \"x\"}, {\"s\": 4, \"t\": \"y\"}]}\r\n... )\r\n>>> schema = \"a struct<x int, y string>, b struct<s int, t string>\"\r\n>>>\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema)\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+------+------+\r\n|     a|     b|\r\n+------+------+\r\n|{1, a}|{3, x}|\r\n|{2, b}|{4, y}|\r\n+------+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nand Spark Connect also works.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn vanilla PySpark without Arrow optimization, `Row` object or `dict` can be handled as struct type if the schema is provided:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.types import *\r\n>>>\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame(\r\n...     {\"a\": [Row(1, \"a\"), Row(2, \"b\")], \"b\": [{\"s\": 3, \"t\": \"x\"}, {\"s\": 4, \"t\": \"y\"}]}\r\n... )\r\n>>> schema = \"a struct<x int, y string>, b struct<s int, t string>\"\r\n>>>\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema)\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n+------+------+\r\n|     a|     b|\r\n+------+------+\r\n|{1, a}|{3, x}|\r\n|{2, b}|{4, y}|\r\n+------+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas with Arrow, it uses a fallback to make it:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema).show()\r\n/.../pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py:329: UserWarning: createDataFrame attempted Arrow optimization because 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled' is set to true; however, failed by the reason below:\r\n  A field of type StructType expects a pandas.DataFrame, but got: <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\r\nAttempting non-optimization as 'spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.fallback.enabled' is set to true.\r\n  warn(msg)\r\n+------+------+\r\n|     a|     b|\r\n+------+------+\r\n|{1, a}|{3, x}|\r\n|{2, b}|{4, y}|\r\n+------+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nand Spark Connect fails:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(pdf, schema)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: A field of type StructType expects a pandas.DataFrame, but got: <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`Row` object or `dict` in pandas DataFrame works as struct type when `createDataFrame` if the schema is provided.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related test.","created_at":"2023-05-12T00:33:36Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T19:25:43Z","closed_at":"2023-05-16T02:06:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2872b7dbcaf4047242331e3c75d3832273b328c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e5ee211b8235d7215cdd8d4759e796a887a9f95","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-43473/rows","ref":"issues/SPARK-43473/rows","sha":"4e5ee211b8235d7215cdd8d4759e796a887a9f95","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"htt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix nested MapType behavior in Pandas UDF (and Arrow-optimized Python UDF).\r\n\r\nPreviously during Arrow-pandas conversion, only the outermost layer is converted to a dictionary; but now nested MapType will be converted to nested dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThat applies to Spark Connect as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCorrectness and consistency (with `createDataFrame` and `toPandas` when Arrow is enabled).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nNested MapType type support is corrected in Pandas UDF\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> schema = StructType([\r\n...      StructField(\"id\", StringType(), True),\r\n...      StructField(\"attributes\", MapType(StringType(), MapType(StringType(), StringType())), True)\r\n... ])\r\n>>> \r\n>>> data = [\r\n...    (\"1\", {\"personal\": {\"name\": \"John\", \"city\": \"New York\"}}),\r\n... ]\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)\r\n>>> @pandas_udf(StringType())\r\n... def f(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n...    return s.astype(str)\r\n... \r\n>>> df.select(f(df.attributes)).show(truncate=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results of `df.select(f(df.attributes)).show(truncate=False)` is corrected\r\n\r\n**FROM**\r\n```py\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+                        \r\n|f(attributes)                                         |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|{'personal': [('name', 'John'), ('city', 'New York')]}|\r\n+------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TO**\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.select(f(df.attributes)).show(truncate=False)\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n|f(attributes)                                     |\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n|{'personal': {'name': 'John', 'city': 'New York'}}|\r\n+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Another more obvious example:**\r\n```py\r\n>>> @pandas_udf(StringType())\r\n... def extract_name(s:pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n...     return s.apply(lambda x: x['personal']['name'])\r\n...\r\n>>> df.select(extract_name(df.attributes)).show(truncate=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`df.select(extract_name(df.attributes)).show(truncate=False)` is corrected\r\n\r\n**FROM**\r\n```py\r\norg.apache.spark.api.python.PythonException: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new spark connect relation type `CachedDataFrame`, which can represent a DataFrame that's been cached on the server side.\r\n\r\nOn the server side, each (userId, sessionId) has a map to cache DataFrame. DataFrame will be removed from cache when the corresponding session expires. (The caller can also evict the DataFrame from cache earlier, depending on the logic.)\r\n\r\nOn the client side, a new relation type and function is added. The new function can create a DataFrame reference given a key. The key is the id of a cached DataFrame, which is usually passed from server to the client. When transforming the DataFrame reference, the server finds the actual DataFrame from the cache and replace it.\r\n\r\nOne use case of this function will be streaming foreachBatch(). Server needs to call user function for every batch which takes a DataFrame as argument. With the new function, we can cache the DataFrame on the server. Pass the id back to client which can creates the DataFrame reference. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is needed to support streaming foreachBatch() in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the grammar rule of the `DATEADD`/`TIMESTAMPADD` and `DATEDIFF`/`TIMESTAMPDIFF`, and catch wrong type of the first argument `unit` when an user pass a string instead of an identifier like `YEAR`, ..., `MICROSECOND`. In that case, Spark raised an error of new error class `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE.DATETIME_UNIT`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the error message clear for the case when a literal string instead of an identifier is passed to the datetime `ADD`/`DIFF` functions:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select dateadd('MONTH', 1, date'2023-05-11');\r\n[WRONG_NUM_ARGS.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION] The `dateadd` requires 2 parameters but the actual number is 3. Please, refer to 'https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-functions.html' for a fix.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes the error class.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select dateadd('MONTH', 1, date'2023-05-11');\r\n\r\n[INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE.DATETIME_UNIT] The value of parameter(s) `unit` in `dateadd` is invalid: expects one of the units without quotes YEAR, QUARTER, MONTH, WEEK, DAY, DAYOFYEAR, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND, MILLISECOND, MICROSECOND, but got the string literal 'MONTH'.(line 1, pos 7)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nselect dateadd('MONTH', 1, date'2023-05-11')\r\n-------^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe deprecation message of `createOrReplace` indicates that we should change `createOrReplace` to `serverSideApply` instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@deprecated please use {@link ServerSideApplicable#serverSideApply()} or attempt a create and edit/patch operation.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change is not fully equivalent, but I believe it's reasonable.\r\n\r\n> With the caveat that the user may choose not to use forcing if they want to know when there are conflicting changes.\r\n> \r\n> Also unlike createOrReplace if the resourceVersion is set on the resource and a replace is attempted, it will be optimistically locked.\r\n\r\nSee more details at https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/pull/5073\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRemove usage of deprecated API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass

There is no way to judge whether the change has improved the speed for Timestamp type inference.\r\n\r\nSo we need a benchmark to measure whether our optimization of Timestamp type inference is useful, we have valid Timestamp value benchmark at now, but don't have invalid Timestamp value benchmark when use Timestamp type inference.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAdd new benchmark for Timestamp type inference when use invalid value, to make sure our speed up PR work normally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nbenchmarks already are test code.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR proposes to provide support for the registration of an Arrow-optimized Python UDF in both vanilla PySpark and Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, when users register an Arrow-optimized Python UDF, it will be registered as a pickled Python UDF and thus, executed without Arrow optimization. \r\n\r\nWe should support Arrow-optimized Python UDFs registration and execute them with Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. No API changes, but result differences are expected in some cases.\r\n\r\nPreviously, a registered Arrow-optimized Python UDF will be executed without Arrow optimization.\r\nNow, it will be executed with Arrow optimization, as shown below.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n>>> df = spark.range(2)\r\n>>> df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\n>>> @udf(useArrow=True)\r\n... def f(x):\r\n...     return str(x)\r\n... \r\n\r\n>>> spark.udf.register('str_f', f)\r\n<pyspark.sql.udf.UserDefinedFunction object at 0x7fa1980c16a0>\r\n\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"select str_f(id) from df\").explain()  # Executed with Arrow optimization\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(2) Project [pythonUDF0#32 AS f(id)#30]\r\n+- ArrowEvalPython [f(id#27L)#29], [pythonUDF0#32], 101\r\n   +- *(1) Range (0, 2, step=1, splits=16)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnabling or disabling Arrow optimization can produce result differences in some cases - we are working on minimizing the result differences though.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nSPARK-40307\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-11T00:23:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T22:52:48Z","closed_at":"2023-05-15T03:36:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"235074ef278faed2ad329b8d47d6b3eb97716189","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41125/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41125/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41125/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23e6cba9ffb7e56bdcc624eeb174086ae01c101d","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:registerArrowPythonUDF","ref":"registerArrowPythonUDF","sha":"23e6cba9ffb7e56bdcc624eeb174086ae01c101d","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267, #35357, #36889, #38209 and #39755.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

Recursively visits all subexpressions regardless of whether the current expression is a conditional expression.\r\n* For each common expression:\r\n  * Add a new boolean variable subExprInit to indicate whether it has  already been evaluated. \r\n  * Add a new code block in CodeGenSupport trait, and reset those subExprInit variables to false before the physical operators begin to evaluate the input row.\r\n  * Add a new wrapper subExpr function for each common subexpression.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void subExpr_n(${argList}) {\r\n if (!subExprInit_n) {\r\n   ${eval.code}\r\n   subExprInit_n = true;\r\n   subExprIsNull_n = ${eval.isNull};\r\n   subExprValue_n = ${eval.value};\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * When generating the input expression code,  if the input expression is a common expression, the expression code will be replaced with the corresponding subExpr function. When the subExpr function is called for the first time, subExprInit will be set to true, and the subsequent function calls will do nothing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSupport more subexpression elimination cases, improve performance.\r\n\r\nFor example, TPCDS q23b query,  we can reuse the result of projection `sum(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price)` in the if expressions:\r\n```\r\nif (isnull((cast(input[2, int, true] as decimal(10,0)) * input[3, decimal(7,2), true])))\r\n   input[0, decimal(28,2), true]\r\nelse \r\n   (input[0, decimal(28,2), true] + cast(knownnotnull((cast(input[2, int, true] as decimal(10,0)) * input[3, decimal(7,2), true])) as decimal(28,2)))\r\n```\r\nq4, q62, q67 are similar to the above.\r\n\r\n| Query    | Time with PR |

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport ANALYZE TABLE on v2 tables.\r\n\r\nThrough this PR, users can use the `ANALYZE TABLE` statement on Datasourcev2 to analyze the table. Since the API of Datasourcev2 does not support the `NOSCAN` and `PARTITION` features, currently using the Analyze table with `PARTITION`, `COLUMNS` and `NOSCAN` statements will report an error.\r\n\r\nThe statistics obtained through the analysis will be stored in the `SessionState` to be used by statements of the `DESC EXTENDED`. In the future, the data in the `SessionState` can be provided to `DataSourceV2Relation` to reduce repeated statistics.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ANALYZE TABLE` syntax for aligning Datasourcev1 and v2\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-10T02:14:25Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T17:35:47Z","closed_at":"2023-10-20T01:09:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74e9e59df4c66419762045d6be09caf63b39186f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a581e0013890990a0dd1b9a5d683e526b2d61c28","head":{"label":"Hisoka-X:Support_ANALYZE_TABLE_on_v2_tables","ref":"Support_ANALYZE_TABLE_on_v2_tables","sha":"a581e0013890990a0dd1b9a5d683e526b2d61c28","user":{"login":"Hisoka-X","id":32387433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32387433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X","html_url":"https://github.com/Hisoka-X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203537234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDM1MzcyMzQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"Hisoka-X/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Hisoka-X","id":32387433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3NDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32387433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X","html_url":"https://github.com/Hisoka-X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hisoka-X/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Hisoka-X/spark","description":"Apache

When deserializing protobuf values with fields of these types, the `from_protobuf` library currently transforms them to the spark type of:\r\n\r\nuint32 => `IntegerType`\r\nuint64 => `LongType`\r\n\r\n`IntegerType` and `LongType` are [signed](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html) integer types, so this can lead to confusing results. Namely, if a uint32 value in a stored proto is above 2^31 or a uint64 value is above 2^63, their representation in binary will contain a 1 in the highest bit, which when interpreted as a signed integer will come out as negative (I.e. overflow).\r\n\r\nI propose that we deserialize unsigned integer types into a type that can contain them correctly, e.g.\r\nuint32 => `LongType`\r\nuint64 => `Decimal(20, 0)`\r\n\r\n**Precedent**\r\nI believe that unsigned integer types in **parquet** are deserialized in a similar manner, i.e. put into a larger type so that the unsigned representation natively fits. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34817 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31921\r\n\r\n** Example to reproduce **\r\n\r\nConsider a protobuf message like:\r\n```\r\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\r\n\r\nmessage Test {\r\n  uint64 val = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerate a protobuf with a value above 2^63. I did this in python with a small script like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport test_pb2\r\n\r\ns = test_pb2.Test()\r\ns.val = 9223372036854775809 # 2**63 + 1\r\nserialized = s.SerializeToString()\r\nprint(serialized)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis generates the binary representation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nb'\\x08\\x81\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x80\\x01'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, deserialize this using `from_protobuf`. I did this in a notebook so its easier to see, but could reproduce in a scala test as well:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"597\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1002986/a6c58c19-b9d3-44d4-8c2a-605991d3d5de\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Backwards Compatibility / Default Behavior**\r\n**Should we maintain backwards compatibility and add an option that allows deserializing these types differently? OR should we change change the default behavior (with an option to go back to the old way)? Would love some thoughts here!**\r\n\r\nI think by default it makes more sense to deserialize them as the larger types so that it's semantically more correct. However, there may be existing users of this library that would be affected by this behavior change. Though, maybe we can justify the change since the function is tagged as `Experimental` (and spark 3.4.0 was only released very recently).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove unsigned integer deserialization behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, as written it would change the deserialization behavior of unsigned integer field types. However, please see the above section about whether we should or should not maintain backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit Testing\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-09T17:12:54Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T00:17:42Z","closed_at":"2023-09-18T00:17:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d660874033e9873e7ac28a81f8cbc5e9d0fe8bb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41108/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41108/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41108/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8f542a1d35c2bcd1e86637f513601a60bc81404d","head":{"label":"justaparth:parth/uint64-as-bigdecimal","ref":"parth/uint64-as-bigdecimal","sha":"8f542a1d35c2bcd1e86637f513601a60bc81404d","user":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610834975,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGiaHw","name":"spark","full_name":"justaparth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnsure old SparkUI in HistoryServer has been detached before loading new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe error described in SPARK-43403 happened quite often when user opened SparkUIs of in-progress Apps frequently.\r\n\r\nIt happened when `FsHistoryProvider#onUIDetached` run (in thread-a) right after a new SparkUI with the same appId and attemptId was loaded (in thread-b).\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we let loading of the new SparkUI wait until old SparkUI is detached.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test `Load new SparkUI during old one is detaching` in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn order to reduce the checkpoint duration and end to end latency, we propose Changelog Based Checkpointing for RocksDB State Store Provider. Below is the mechanism.\r\n1. Changelog checkpoint: Upon each put() delete() call to local rocksdb instance, log the operation to a changelog file. During the state change commit,  sync the compressed change log of the current batch to DFS as checkpointDir/{version}.delta.\r\n2. Version reconstruction: For version j, find latest snapshot i.zip such that i <= j, load snapshot i, and replay i+1.delta ~ j.delta. This is used in loading the initial state as well as creating the latest version snapshot. Note: If a query is shutdown without exception, there won’t be changelog replay during query restart because a maintenance task is executed before the state store instance is unloaded.\r\n3. Background snapshot: A maintenance thread in executors will launch maintenance tasks periodically. Inside the maintenance task, sync the latest RocksDB local snapshot to DFS as checkpointDir/{version}.zip. Snapshot enables faster failure recovery and allows old versions to be purged.\r\n4. Garbage collection: Inside the maintenance task, delete snapshot and delta files from DFS for versions that is out of retention range(default retained version number is 100)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have identified state checkpointing latency as one of the major performance bottlenecks for stateful streaming queries. Currently, RocksDB state store pauses the RocksDB instances to upload a snapshot to the cloud when committing a batch, which is heavy weight and has unpredictable performance.\r\nWith changelog based checkpointing, we allow the RocksDB instance to run uninterruptibly, which improves RocksDB operation performance. This also dramatically reduces the commit time and batch duration because we are uploading a smaller amount of data during state commit. With this change, stateful query with RocksDB state store will have lower and more predictable latency.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit test for changelog checkpointing utility.\r\nAdd unit test and integration test that check backward compatibility with existing checkpoint.\r\nEnable RocksDB state store unit test and stateful streaming query integration test to run with changelog checkpointing enabled.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-09T06:25:45Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T06:26:11Z","closed_at":"2023-06-01T05:34:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4fd27bb2335fa3aef4fedadc82c618e3531642f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds `SparkSession.Builder.getOrCreate()` to the scala client. `getOrCreate` is used in many existing examples so it is good to support it.\r\n\r\nSpark Connect is a bit different from the old API in that it allows you to connect to multiple servers in the same process. This means that we cannot entirely match the existing semantics (one session for all). I opted to cache a number of `SparkSessions`, and make `getOrCreate` return a cached session if they share the same client configuration.  I have also added a `create()` method for cases where you want a newly instantiated session.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove compatibility with the existing code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests for this.","created_at":"2023-05-09T02:15:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-23T09:05:33Z","closed_at":"2023-05-09T19:14:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c70429257536488781c6ee33ec5bd5da0618063","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f94de4c11c1665dc69a32ce6d4a75ac96293dd7c","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-43418","ref":"SPARK-43418","sha":"f94de4c11c1665dc69a32ce6d4a75ac96293dd7c","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses a test flakiness issue in Kafka connector RDD suites\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34089#pullrequestreview-872739182 (Spark 3.4.0) upgraded Spark to Kafka 3.1.0, which requires a different configuration key for configuring the broker listening port. That PR updated the `KafkaTestUtils.scala` used in SQL tests, but there's a near-duplicate of that code in a different `KafkaTestUtils.scala` used by RDD API suites which wasn't updated. As a result, the RDD suites began using Kafka's default port 9092 and this results in flakiness as multiple concurrent suites hit port conflicts when trying to bind to that default port.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by simply copying the updated configuration from the SQL copy of `KafkaTestUtils.scala`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix test flakiness due to port

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore this PR, IN subquery expressions are incorrectly marked as non-nullable, even when they are actually nullable. They correctly check the nullability of the left-hand-side, but the right-hand-side of a IN subquery, the ListQuery, is currently defined with nullability = false always. This is incorrect and can lead to incorrect query transformations.\r\n\r\nExample: `(non_nullable_col IN (select nullable_col)) <=> TRUE`. Here the IN expression returns NULL when the nullable_col is null, but our code marks it as non-nullable, and therefore SimplifyBinaryComparison transforms away the <=> TRUE, transforming the expression to `non_nullable_col IN (select nullable_col)`, which is an incorrect transformation because NULL values of nullable_col now cause the expression to yield NULL instead of FALSE.\r\n\r\nFix this by calculating nullability correctly from the ListQuery child output expressions.\r\n\r\nThis bug can potentially lead to wrong results, but in most cases this doesn't directly cause wrong results end-to-end, because IN subqueries are almost always transformed to semi/anti/existence joins in RewritePredicateSubquery, and this rewrite can also incorrectly discard NULLs, which is another bug. But we can observe it causing wrong behavior in unit tests at least.\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug that has existed at least since 2016, as long as the ListQuery class has existed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nMay change query results to fix correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-08T21:22:21Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T16:03:22Z","closed_at":"2023-05-16T01:41:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b2a4d53193757076e19d0e595c1b611e49864af2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/112d77ec2647bec2bcfbd7be88f8cf8d13bcbc25","head":{"label":"jchen5:listquery-nullable","ref":"listquery-nullable","sha":"112d77ec2647bec2bcfbd7be88f8cf8d13bcbc25","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollow up https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36562 , performance improvement when Timestamp type inference with legacy format.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation of CSV/JSON data source, the schema inference with legacy format relies on methods that will throw exceptions if the fields can't convert as some data types .\r\n\r\nThrowing and catching exceptions can be slow. We can improve it by creating methods that return optional results instead.\r\n\r\nThe optimization of DefaultTimestampFormatter has been implemented in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36562 , this PR adds the optimization of legacy format. The basic logic is to prevent the formatter from throwing exceptions, and then use catch to determine whether the parsing is successful.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPerformance improvement when Timestamp type inference with legacy format.\r\n\r\nWhen use JSON datasource, the speed up `67%`. CSV datasource speed also up, but not obvious.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip reusing sst file for same version of RocksDB state store to avoid id mismatch error\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn case of task retry on the same executor, its possible that the original task completed the phase of creating the SST files and uploading them to the object store. In this case, we also might have added an entry to the in-memory map for `versionToRocksDBFiles` for the given version. When the retry task creates the local checkpoint, its possible the file name and size is the same, but the metadata ID embedded within the file may be different. So, when we try to load this version on successful commit, the metadata zip file points to the old SST file which results in a RocksDB mismatch id error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMismatch in unique ID on table file 24220. Expected: {9692563551998415634,4655083329411385714} Actual: {9692563551998415639,10299185534092933087} in file

change avoids reusing files for the same version on the same host based on the map entries to reduce the chance of running into the error above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nScalar subquery can be pushed down as data filter at runtime, since we always execute subquery first. Ideally, we can rewrite `ScalarSubquery` to `Literal` before pushing down filter. The main issue before we do not support that is `ReuseSubquery` is ineffective, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22518. It is not a issue now.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 > (SELECT min(c2) FROM t2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove peformance if data filter have scalar subquery.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd the config `spark.files.fetchFailure.unRegisterOutputThreshold` to control the number of fetch failed failures needed for one specific executor to unregister map output on this executor and allow to disable unregister.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark will unregister map output on the executor when fetch failed from this executor. This might be too aggressive when fetch failed is temporary and recoverable, especially when re-computation is more expensive than retry failed fetch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollow up #36562 , performance improvement when Timestamp type inference with user-provided format.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation of CSV/JSON data source, the schema inference with user-provided format relies on methods that will throw exceptions if the fields can't convert as some data types . \r\n\r\nThrowing and catching exceptions can be slow. We can improve it by creating methods that return optional results instead.\r\n\r\nThe optimization of `DefaultTimestampFormatter` has been implemented in #36562 , this PR adds the optimization of user-provided format. The basic logic is to prevent the formatter from throwing exceptions, and then use catch to determine whether the parsing is successful.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance improvement when Timestamp type inference with user-provided format.\r\n\r\nWhen use JSON datasource, the speed up `88%`. CSV datasource speed also up, but not obvious.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd config `spark.decommission.maxRatio` to control max ratio of decommissioning executors of running ones\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDecommission too many executors at the same time with shuffle or rdd migration could severely hurt performance of shuffle fetch. Block manager decommissioner try to migrate shuffle or rdd as soon as possible, this will compete network and disk IO with shuffle fetch in the target executor. This only affects decommission triggered by driver.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, added new config `spark.decommission.maxRatio`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in `ExecutorMonitorSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-07T02:25:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T00:19:46Z","closed_at":"2024-01-24T00:19:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"441ce6aa297ae0f59831b91d66629bda34da9edc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34622eac796af7435a2807cd5c8fac119b632b49","head":{"label":"warrenzhu25:decom-ratio","ref":"decom-ratio","sha":"34622eac796af7435a2807cd5c8fac119b632b49","user":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217627454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc2Mjc0NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"warrenzhu25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen deserializing protobuf enum fields, the spark-protobuf library will deserialize them as string values based on the enum name in the proto. E.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage Person {\r\n  enum Job {\r\n    NOTHING = 0;\r\n    ENGINEER = 1;\r\n    DOCTOR = 2;\r\n  }\r\n  Job job = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd we have a message like\r\n\r\n```\r\nPerson(job=ENGINEER)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the deserialized value will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"job\": \"ENGINEER\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever it can be useful to deserialize the enum integer value rather than the name, namely:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"job\": 1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit adds that functionality to spark protobuf via an option, \"enums.as.ints\". In addition, it also allows serializing such fields back into protobuf via `to_protobuf`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples in other libraries:\r\n\r\n- protobuf-java-util JsonFormat: https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.protobuf/protobuf-java-util/3.10.0/com/google/protobuf/util/JsonFormat.Printer.html#printingEnumsAsInts--\r\n- golang/protobuf jsonpb marshaler https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb#Marshaler\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdds new functionality that exists in other libraries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds a new option to from_protobuf.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests confirming this behavior.","created_at":"2023-05-06T21:50:04Z","updated_at":"2023-05-16T15:26:48Z","closed_at":"2023-05-10T03:08:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"152fad04571ccfa7e561a005a2bd738305e42b8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da7c091af3d84bfc5f8f65dd7ee245d8939835b5","head":{"label":"justaparth:parth/enum-as-int","ref":"parth/enum-as-int","sha":"da7c091af3d84bfc5f8f65dd7ee245d8939835b5","user":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610834975,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGiaHw","name":"spark","full_name":"justaparth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark has a (long-standing) overflow bug in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\nConsider the following operations:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE foo (l LONG);\")\r\nspark.sql(s\"INSERT INTO foo VALUES (${Long.MaxValue});\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT sequence(0, l) FROM foo;\").collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of these operations will be:\r\n```\r\nArray[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([WrappedArray()])\r\n```\r\nan unintended consequence of overflow.\r\n\r\nThe sequence is applied to values `0` and `Long.MaxValue` with a step size of `1` which uses a length computation defined [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3451). In this calculation, with `start = 0`, `stop = Long.MaxValue`, and `step = 1`, the calculated `len` overflows to `Long.MinValue`. The computation, in binary looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n- 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n/ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\r\n+ 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following [check](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3454) passes as the negative `Long.MinValue` is still `<= MAX_ROUNDED_ARRAY_LENGTH`. The following cast to `toInt` uses this representation and [truncates the upper bits](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/16411188c7ba6cb19c46a2bd512b2485a4c03e2c/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/collectionOperations.scala#L3457) resulting in an empty length of `0`.\r\n\r\nOther overflows are similarly problematic.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by checking numeric operations in the length computation for overflow.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a correctness bug from overflow in the `sequence` expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests added in `CollectionExpressionsSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2023-05-06T03:49:30Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T22:53:50Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T06:27:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ecb32f1a4095c1800e3c9672034a7dd70b64b0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/83d56d42fa8ad84801555013258ced30d44727f4","head":{"label":"thepinetree:spark-sequence-overflow","ref":"spark-sequence-overflow","sha":"83d56d42fa8ad84801555013258ced30d44727f4","user":{"login":"thepinetree","id":25930859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTMwODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25930859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree","html_url":"https://github.com/thepinetree","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":636496938,"node_id":"R_kgDOJfAsKg","name":"spark","full_name":"thepinetree/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thepinetree","id":25930859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTMwODU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25930859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree","html_url":"https://github.com/thepinetree","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thepinetree/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thepinetree/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNot close idle connection when closeIdleConnection is disabled\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark will close idle connection when there're outstanding requests but no traffic for at least `requestTimeoutMs` even with closeIdleConnection is disabled. This will cause all shuffle output on this executor being unregistered when executor has spike IO with long fetch delay.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-06T00:23:32Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T00:17:34Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T00:17:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88dac4a924bfa358c49bc57f2d7040afef63d245","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41071/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41071/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41071/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dd8f8219627ec7a415d96c90e93c17142ffbe82d","head":{"label":"warrenzhu25:idle","ref":"idle","sha":"dd8f8219627ec7a415d96c90e93c17142ffbe82d","user":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217627454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc2Mjc0NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"warrenzhu25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a new method `useNullableQuerySchema` in `Table`, to allow the DataSource implementation to declare whether they need to reserve schema nullability on CTAS/RTAS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-28837 forcibly uses the nullable schema on CTAS/RTAS, which seems too aggressive:\r\n\r\n1. The existing matured RDBMSs have different behaviors for reserving schema nullability on CTAS/RTAS, as mentioned in #25536, PostgreSQL forcibly uses the nullable schema, but MySQL respects the query's output schema nullability.\r\n2. Some OLAP systems(e.g. ClickHouse) are perf-sensitive for nullable, and have strict restrictions on table schema, e.g. the primary keys are not allowed to be nullable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this PR adds a new DSv2 API, but the default implementation reserves backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUTs are updated.","created_at":"2023-05-05T21:54:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T09:10:21Z","closed_at":"2023-05-09T09:10:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9446d6dee86aedd4ebf24ce08653fb0230f64c0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41070/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41070/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41070/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/13e8b75fcca41928bb1ff8cee603f8841433e467","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-43390","ref":"SPARK-43390","sha":"13e8b75fcca41928bb1ff8cee603f8841433e467","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nGenerator is an expression that produces zero or more rows given a single input row. If UserDefinedGenerator and HiveUDTF were used, the output could be N times that of the child node, resulting in a statistical error.\r\n\r\nBecause of incorrect statistics, Spark may select an incorrect execution plan. For example, if `BroadcastHashJoinExec` is selected, the Job maybe fails to broadcast buildSide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `Generator`'s statistics should be ratio times greater than the child nodes. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Added a configuration to determine that the udtf output data is ratio times the input data\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to make `df.show` print a nice string for `MapType`.\r\n\r\nLet's say have an example like this:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT map(1,1.1, 2,2.2) AS col\").show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore, it print\r\n```log\r\n+--------------------+\r\n|col                 |\r\n+--------------------+\r\n|{1 -> 1.1, 2 -> 2.2}|\r\n+--------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it prints as follows, that's consistent with `spark-sql` CLI.\r\n```log\r\n+-------------+\r\n|col          |\r\n+-------------+\r\n|{1:1.1,2:2.2}|\r\n+-------------+\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake `df.show` print a nice string for `MapType`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, They will face better nice strings representation for MapType.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExist

What changes were proposed in this pull request? Remove css `!important` tag for asc/desc arrow icons in jquery.dataTables.1.10.25.min.css\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpgrading to DataTables 1.10.25 broke asc/desc arrow icons for sorting column. The sorting icon is not displayed when the column is clicked to sort by asc/desc. This is because the new DataTables 1.10.25's jquery.dataTables.1.10.25.min.css file added `!important` rule preventing the override set in webui-dataTables.css\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? No.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request? Remove css `!important` tag for asc/desc arrow icons in jquery.dataTables.1.10.25.min.css\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpgrading to DataTables 1.10.25 broke asc/desc arrow icons for sorting column. The sorting icon is not displayed when the column is clicked to sort by asc/desc. This is because the new DataTables 1.10.25's jquery.dataTables.1.10.25.min.css file added `!important` rule preventing the override set in webui-dataTables.css\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? No.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40678 adds a dialect parameter to makeGetter for applying dialect specific conversions when reading a Java Timestamp into TimestampNTZType.\r\n\r\nBut there exists duplicated conversion.\r\n`JdbcDialect` calls `DateTimeUtils.microsToLocalDateTime` first and return `LocalDateTime` to `makeGetter`.\r\nBut `makeGetter` calls `DateTimeUtils.localDateTimeToMicros` later.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't think it's necessary to maintain complete symmetry between `convertJavaTimestampToTimestampNTZ` and `convertTimestampNTZToJavaTimestamp`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify code to avoid duplicated conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n\r\nThe micro benchmark.\r\n\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_311-b11 on Mac OS X

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce `SQL_ARROW_BATCHED_UDF` EvalType for Arrow-optimized Python UDFs.\r\n\r\nAn EvalType is used to uniquely identify a UDF type in PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are about to improve nested non-atomic input/output support of an Arrow-optimized Python UDF.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, it shares the same EvalType with a pickled Python UDF, but the same implementation with a Pandas UDF.\r\n\r\nIntroducing an EvalType enables isolating the changes to Arrow-optimized Python UDFs.\r\n\r\nThe PR is also a pre-requisite for registering an Arrow-optimized Python UDF.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo user-facing behavior/result changes for Arrow-optimized Python UDFs.\r\n\r\nAn `evalType`, as an attribute mainly designed for internal use, is changed as shown below:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> udf(lambda x: str(x), useArrow=True).evalType == PythonEvalType.SQL_ARROW_BATCHED_UDF\r\nTrue\r\n\r\n# whereas\r\n\r\n>>> udf(lambda x: str(x), useArrow=False).evalType == PythonEvalType.SQL_BATCHED_UDF\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new unit test `test_eval_type` and existing
