fixes the Flink and Spark Postcommits failing after some gradle tasks were changed. This was due to not enabling Jenkins support for the changed gradle tasks for the Postcommits which run on Jenkins. In addition to fixing that, this change adjusts the way that Jenkins support is enabled. Instead of creating a whole new task to run integration tests with Jenkins, the tasks now check a project property.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a variety of small changes needed to enable cross-language tests to work on Dataflow. Here's a list of changes:\r\n\r\n1. Allow running pipelines with portable job submission (required for x-lang transforms).\r\n2. Allow submitting Dataflow jobs with multiple environments.\r\n3. Add SdkHarnessContainerImageOverrides flag to allow specifying overrides for multiple environments. This implementation works by calling the flag multiple times, once for each override.\r\n4. Update the ValidatesRunner script to use the above functionality (portable submission and overrides) as well as uploading a Java SDK container for cross-language in addition to a Go SDK container.\r\n5. Don't namespace environments in external transform expansion. This avoids bugs that occurred because an environment with an empty value was present in the final pipeline.\r\n6. Skip fake impulse generation in external transform expansion. Something must have changed on the expansion service end, because this is no longer necessary, and was causing problems because the fake impulse wasn't getting properly removed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

followup to #14113 to improve the schema equality checking.\r\n\r\nThe check in the previous PR has a high false positive rate for detecting whether a schema update job needs to be run because a schema update job is created even if the field ordering is different.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a schema equivalence check with more specificity. Now we can do a field-order insensitive comparison on the schema and only run a schema update job when the fields themselves are different.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

hints allow pipeline authors, transform authors,  and pipeline users express desired resource constraints in transform execution environments. Resource hints interpretation will be provided by Beam runners and runners can ignore hints that they don't understand. To ensure good users experience, Beam SDK can define common resource hints, their URNs, parsing and merging logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a capability to express resource hints in and adds two example resource hints: \r\n- min_ram - minimum amount of memory that should be available to the transform execution environment.\r\n- accelerator - desired requirements for hardware accelerators that a runner should provision in transform's execution environment. \r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\n- [Mailing list discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ra4f90560ac82bdbedfef36b3cd508da70ee7cf23383a0451d3875e45%40%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E) \r\n- [Design proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1phExeGD1gdDI9M8LK4ZG57UGa7dswpB8Aj6jxWj4uQk/edit#heading=h.bkhpa7ewpcy2) \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds the necessary infrastructure for generating API documentation for the Beam DataFrame API. Specifically, it adds `frame_base.with_docs_from`, which can be used to pull the docstring from a corresponding pandas method and modify it appropriately for the Beam DataFrame API. Specifically these modifications include:\r\n- Any existing docstring on the method is written to a custom \"Differences from pandas\" section, included after the parameters and return type, and just before the \"See also\" section.\r\n- The Examples section from pandas is included in the new docstring, but with a disclaimer that these are _pandas_ examples. We also add a header to make sure the sphinx doctest framework doesn't try to execute these examples. We already have an extensive framework for verifying our implementation against pandas' doctests.\r\n- References to \"version x.y\" are updates to state \"_pandas_ version x.y\" to avoid confusion with beam version.\r\n- Refernces to Series and DataFrame outside of the Examples section are replaced with DeferredSeries and DeferredDataFrame.\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes some modifications to `generate_pydoc.sh` to make it work with this new form of docstring:\r\n- Allow the \"Differences from pandas\" section\r\n- Make sure we include `inherited-members` for `apache_beam.dataframe.frames` (see [dev@ discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1718e082059f75a93e00634fe869fe0556212b82f23cbd0d8e73fd96%40%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E))\r\n- Allow intersphinx to add links to numpy and pandas documentation\r\n- Ignore WARNINGs related to `apache_beam.dataframe.frames`, unfortunately the pandas docstrings are not compatible with our \"nitpicky\" config and thus raise a lot of warnings: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/476c2b1a39e4190b8391973772e4ab826a13f153/sdks/python/scripts/generate_pydoc.sh#L218\r\n\r\nRemaining changes include:\r\n- Update some docstrings for better rendering in the html API docs\r\n- Add (skipped) DocstringTest to identify un-documented operations\r\n- Demonstrate the use of `@with_docs_from` on a few operations.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

Replaced all assert_called_with with assert_any_call in the\r\n   ProgressIndicatorTest.\r\n2. assert_called_with only asserts the most recent call. However, there\r\n   is an IPythonLogHandler we have customized to emit rich logging in\r\n   notebooks that also calls display to render HTML and JavaScript. The\r\n   emission of logs can happen any time during the test, causing the\r\n   flakiness. Instead of unregistering the log handler during tests that\r\n   could make the tests unnecessarily complicated, we could use\r\n   assert_any_call within the patched context for simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to [PostgreSQL JDBC documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/query.html#query-with-cursor), it is required to disable autocommit in order to allow cursor streaming.\r\n\r\nIn `JdbcIO:1548` we have `poolableConnectionFactory.setDefaultAutoCommit(false);`, however it is only applicable to poolable datasource. So any other usage will eventually lead to OOM since the JDBC driver silently falls back to full memoization of the request result.\r\n\r\nThe commit disables autocommit more

change set represents a rather large (and backward compatible) change to the way ElastichsearchIO.Write operates. Presently, the Write transform has 2 responsibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Convert input documents into Bulk API entities, serializing based on user settings (partial update, delete, upsert, etc) -> `DocToBulk`\r\n2. Batch the converted Bulk API entities together and interface with the target ES cluster  -> `BulkIO`\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to separate these 2 responsibilities into discrete PTransforms to allow for greater flexibility while also maintaining the convenience of the Write transform to perform both document conversion and IO serially. Examples of how the flexibility of separate transforms could be used:\r\n\r\n1. Unit testing. It becomes trivial for pipeline developers to ensure that output Bulk API entities for a given set of inputs will produce an expected result, without the need for an available Elasticsearch cluster. \r\n2. Flexible options for data backup. Serialized Bulk API entities can be forked and sent to both Elasticsearch and a data lake.\r\n3. Mirroring data to multiple clusters. Presently, mirroring data to multiple clusters would require duplicate computation.\r\n4. Better batching with input streams in one job. A job may produce multiple \"shapes\" of Bulk API entities based on multiple input types, and then \"fan-in\" all serialized Bulk entities into a single BulkIO transform to improve batching semantics.\r\n5. Decoupled jobs. Corollary to (4) above. Job(s) could be made to produce Bulk entities and then publish them to a message bus. A distinct job could consume from that message bus and solely be responsible for IO with the target cluster(s).\r\n6. Easier support for multiple BulkIO semantics.\r\n\r\nExpanding on point (6), this PR also introduces a new (optional) way to batch entities for bulk requests: Stateful Processing. Presently, Bulk request size is limited by the lesser of Runner bundle size and `maxBatchSize` user setting. In my experience, bundle sizes are often very small, and can be a small as 1 or 2. When that’s the case, it means Bulk requests contain only 1 or 2 documents, and it’s effectively the same as not using the Bulk API at all. `BulkIOStatefulFn` is made to be compatible with `GroupIntoBatches` which will use entity count and (optionally) elapsed time to create batches much closer to the `maxBatchSize` setting to improve throughput.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to [PostgreSQL JDBC documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/query.html#query-with-cursor), it is required to disable autocommit in order to allow cursor streaming.\r\n\r\nIn `JdbcIO:1548` we have `poolableConnectionFactory.setDefaultAutoCommit(false);`, however it is only applicable to poolable datasource. So any other usage will eventually lead to OOM since the JDBC driver silently falls back to full memoization of the request result.\r\n\r\nThe commit disables autocommit more systematically.\r\n\r\ncc

conversion.\r\n\r\nNumeric values in ZetaSQL are subject to constraints: they must fall within certain hardcoded limits, and the scale also cannot exceed 9.

PR disallows `sort_index` and `sort_values` in most cases. `sort_index(axis=columns)` is the only configuration that is still allowed, since it simply re-orders the columns by name, which we can do at construction time.\r\n\r\n- `sort_index(axis=rows)`, `sort_values(axis=rows)` are disallowed since they impose an ordering. In theory we can successfully perform these operations with `Singleton` partitioning, but this is sub-optimal, and we couldn't guarantee that the ordering wouldn't be lost after a repartition.\r\n- `sort_values(axis=columns)` is disallowed because it re-orders the columns based on the values in the _data_, which we cannot know until execution time.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
