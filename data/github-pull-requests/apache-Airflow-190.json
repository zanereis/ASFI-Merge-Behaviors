#8713. This takes a different approach from previous work (#12710); instead of deprecating anything, the configuration is now resolved in a two-step process:\r\n\r\n1. If an argument is explicitly passed in by the user, it is used (the current ebhaviour), and configuration on the Conenction object is ignored. A try block is added so the Connection is not needed if the user wants to explicitly pass in everything.\r\n2. If the user does not pass in configuration arguments explicitly, the configuration is populated by a Connection object (if available).\r\n\r\nOnly two options are pulled from the Connection: `master` (to the Connection’s `host` and `port`), and `yarn_queue` (the Connection’s extra value `queue`). Those are also used by `SparkSubmitOperator` and already documented.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\nThis is an attempt to close: #14813\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the original problem is that subprocess inherits the *FDs for stdout/stderr* but not the *sys.stdout/stderr file objects*. When the `StandardTaskRunner` call .`start` (which runs `airflow tasks run --raw ...` under the hood), it tries to \"redirect\" the sys.stdout file object to the custom [StreamLogWriter](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/d627dfa72b4395740f9a4948f549bf53a89b2285/airflow/cli/commands/task_command.py#L236) which writes everything into the task logger. However, when the process tries to start a new subprocess, the sys.stdout/stderr file objects are restored, and point to the original FDs. Here is a simple script that shows this behavior:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import redirect_stdout\r\nimport io\r\nimport subprocess\r\n\r\ns_io = io.StringIO()\r\nwith redirect_stdout(s_io):\r\n    print('this is captured')\r\n    subprocess.run(['echo', 'this is not'])\r\n\r\nprint('Captured by redirect: ', s_io.getvalue())\r\n\r\n# this is not\r\n# Captured by redirect:  this is captured\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: So why there are *sys.stdout/stderr file objects*? They are used to **buffer** outputs before flushing them together to the system. (because system calls are expensive)\r\n\r\nBefore the change in #6627, the `--raw` command is started as a subprocess with the stdout/stderr replaced with PIPE at the FDs level, so all stdout/stderr of subsequent subprocesses (i.e. the subprocess spawned by the python callable in the PythonOperator) will go into the PIPE.  A separate thread is also spawned to read from this stream and log into the task logs using `self.log.info`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/25caeda58b50eae6ef425a52e794504bc63855d1/airflow/task/task_runner/base_task_runner.py#L137-L153\r\n\r\nHowever, in the fork path, the FD is left unchanged, so all subsequent subprocess will still write to the original FDs (print to the console). This PR essentially tries to create new PIPEs that replace the original FDs, so we can read the logs from the PIPE similar to the `subprocess.Popen` path.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/25caeda58b50eae6ef425a52e794504bc63855d1/airflow/task/task_runner/standard_task_runner.py#L49\r\n\r\nPotentially, a better approach is to rewrite the `StreamLogWriter` to replace the FDs under the hood. But currently, I'm still wrapping my head around the whole FDs thing. Unless someone can point me a direction on how to rewrite the `StreamLogWriter` or suggest an alternative approach, I will leave it to another day and another PR...\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

fixes the argument ordering of bucket_name and object_name in GCSHook.download.\r\nAll other methods defined on GCSHook have bucket_name before object_name except download.\r\nGoogleCloudStorageHook.download in Airflow 1.0 also defined bucket_name first instead of object_name.\r\n\r\nUsing object_name, bucket_name causes an issue in BigQueryCreateExternalTableOperator and mlengine_operator_utils.create_evaluate_ops where the parameters to GCSHook.download in those operators are passed positionally.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, bucket_name is not an optional parameter in the underlying API and is not represented as such in other methods of GCSHook.\r\n\r\nFound this while debugging a workflow using BigQueryCreateExternalTableOperator with @FedericaLionetto and stumbling on this log line:\r\n```\r\ngoogle.api_core.exceptions.NotFound: 404 GET

since there is Dag Isolation provided as part of the airflow product , but dag users can generate aws_conn_id as seperate dag or some 3rd part system and pass back to original calling dag as part of XCOM variable , and should be able to over ride `aws_conn_id` param in AWS operators via Jinja template etc. But since `aws_conn_id` is not part of `template_fields` is all the AWS operators which makes dag users difficult to overide `aws_conn_id` param via XCOM variable using jinja template.\r\n\r\nfor example : as show in below code snippet , dag user can setup aws sts token into XCOM variable and fetch it using jinja template in `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator` operator\r\n\r\n```\r\ncluster_creator = EmrCreateJobFlowOperator(\r\n        task_id='create_job_flow', \r\n

building airflow package to within the container similarly\r\nas we do with provider packages. This has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n* common environment used to build airflow\r\n* protection against leaking SECRET_* variables in CI in case third\r\n  party packages are installed\r\n* specify --version-suffixes and renaming the packages according\r\n  to destination (SVN/PyPI) automatically\r\n* no need to have node installed in CI runner\r\n* no need to have node installed in DockerHub\r\n* no need to install PIP/Python3 in DockerHub runner (currently\r\n  Python2 is still default and it fails the build there)\r\n* always deleting egg-info and build before the build\r\n* cleaning up egg-info and build after the build\r\n\r\nAlso following the way providers are released, the documentation\r\nis updated to change publishing Airflow using previously voted\r\nand renamed packages - the very same packages that were committed\r\nto SVN. This way anyone will be able to manually verify that the\r\npackages in SVN are the same as those published in SVN and there\r\nis no need to rebuild the packages when releasing them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

up #15666\r\n\r\nThis converts the rest of `tests/www/test_views.py` into `tests/www/views/` and use pytest fixtures to manage them.\r\n\r\n(Run time numbers are different from #15666 since I’m working on another machine.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n(master) $ ./breeze tests -- tests/www/test_views.py tests/www/views/\r\n========== 246 passed, 2 skipped, 10 warnings in 170.95s (0:02:50) ==========\r\n\r\n(tests-www-refactor) $ ./breeze tests -- tests/www/views/\r\n========== 252 passed, 2 skipped, 10 warnings in 164.77s (0:02:44) ==========\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot much difference since the tests were already sharing resources well. But the refactoring is still very worthwhile IMOby virtue of breaking done the three convoluted monster classes in `test_views.py`.\r\n\r\nThe test count increased slightly because I split a few tests in `test_views.py` into smaller ones with `parametrize`. They were doing too much in one tests and did not correctly manage test setup very well.\r\n\r\nThere are still some possible performance boosts left. The `app` fixture in `tests/ww/views/` is currently initialised per-module because some tests modify `app.dag_bag`. But not all modules do, and those that don’t can share an `app` instance instead. But that would make the test setup more complicated (if we incorrectly re-use `app` when we shouldn’t the tests could become stateful and incorrect) so I opted to not do it.\r\n\r\nAfter this I will work on increasing test coverage of `airflow/www/views.py` as suggested in #15525.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

I don't expect that this will introduce any issues when using MySQL 5.x and/or a single scheduler, as `READ COMMITTED` is the default isolation level used by PostgreSQL. \r\n\r\nI haven't had a chance to actually test this implementation as we fixed the errors in our production Airflow environment by updating the isolation level on the database itself. If you'd like, I can set replicate the issue with a default MySQL DB and ensure that this fix works as expected. \r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

This is resolved by giving the\r\npod_template_file test an isolated chart directory it can modify.\r\n\r\n`helm dep update` also doesn't work when it is called in parallel, so\r\nthe fixture

does a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Split `test_views.py` (more than 3000 lines prior to this PR) into smaller files.\r\n2. Convert unittest.TestCase setup/teardown to pytest fixtures\r\n3. Refactor to reuse db and `flask.Flask` setup across tests if possible\r\n\r\nI’ve split out the “easy” parts and shed ~1000 lines off `test_views.py` (now at 2615 lines). This produces a ~13% speedup on my machine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(master) $ ./breeze tests -- tests/www/test_views.py\r\n...\r\n========== 246 passed, 2 skipped, 10 warnings in 350.23s (0:05:50) ==========\r\n\r\n(tests-www-refactor) $ ./breeze tests -- tests/www/test_views.py tests/www/views/\r\n...\r\n========== 246 passed, 2 skipped, 10 warnings in 307.40s (0:05:07) ==========\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot much in the grand scheme of things, but not insignificant either.\r\n\r\nMy ultimate goal is to eliminate `tests/www/test_view.py` *entirely*, and I’m going to continue the work on my fork.

change will enable us easily deploy airflow to kubernetes cluster and test it using different executors.\r\nExample usage:\r\n   ./breeze kind-cluster --executor CeleryExecutor deploy\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nWhen running the kubernetes tests, the task `task_with_volume` in this [example dag](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/example_dags/example_kubernetes_executor_config.py) fails for all other executors except KubernetesExecutor. Tested both CeleryExecutor and LocalExecutor.\r\n\r\nI think it's because the task is performing a volume mount? Maybe we should modify this example dag to work with all executors and have a CI job that runs some select executors in k8 cluster\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the
