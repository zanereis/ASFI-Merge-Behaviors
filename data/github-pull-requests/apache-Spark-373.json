Internally we should stop using `SQLContext` everywhere since that's supposed to be not the main user-facing API anymore.\n\nIn this patch I took care to not break any public APIs. The one place that's suspect is `o.a.s.ml.source.libsvm.DefaultSource`, but according to @mengxr it's not supposed to be public so it's OK to change the underlying `FileFormat` trait.\n\n**Reviewers**: This is a big patch that may be difficult to review but the changes are actually really straightforward. If you prefer I can break it up into a few smaller patches, but it will delay the progress of this issue a little.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo change in functionality intended.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T22:35:57Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T03:59:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T03:56:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3da4b46cf4a518ce2a905a48cb1c996ee1ced7ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e47fbf0de63e78dfdc6b16b1d844dacb2aa09f68","head":{"label":"andrewor14:spark-session-refactor","ref":"spark-session-refactor","sha":"e47fbf0de63e78dfdc6b16b1d844dacb2aa09f68","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

GeneralizedLinearRegressionTrainingSummary was created with model, not summaryModel.\n- Adds hasSummary method.\n- Renames findSummaryModelAndPredictionCol -> getSummaryModel and simplifies that

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR updates `QueryStatusCollector.reset` to create Waiter instead of calling `await(1 milliseconds)` to bypass an ScalaTest's issue that Waiter.await may block forever.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI created a local stress test to call codes in `test(\"event ordering\")` 100 times. It cannot pass without this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nChanged class name defined in R from \"DataFrame\" to \"SparkDataFrame\". A popular package, S4Vector already defines \"DataFrame\" - this change is to avoid conflict.\n\nAside from class name and API/roxygen2 references, SparkR APIs like `createDataFrame`, `as.DataFrame`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTheir PR is to validate the database/table names before storing these information in `ExternalCatalog`. \n\nThis PR is part of the efforts to reduce the dependencies on Hive meta-store for catching any illegal input. \n\nFor example, if users use `backstick` to quote the table/database names containing illegal characters, these names are allowed by Spark Parser, but Hive metastore does not allow them. We need to catch them in SessionCatalog and issue an appropriate error message. We are facing the same issues for creating data source tables.\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE `tab:1`  ...\n```\n\nThis PR enforces the name rules of Spark SQL for `table`/`database`/`view`: `only can contain alphanumeric and underscore characters.` Different from Hive, we allow the names with starting underscore characters. \n\nWhen the `ExternalCatalog` is Hive Metastore, we add an extra check by using `MetaStoreUtils.validateName` to verify its validity. \n\nIn the future PRs, we will continue the work on validation of function/column names. \n\n**Updated**: Running SQL on files directly could temporarily break the naming rules. For example,\n\n``` SQL\n  select id from `org.apache.spark.sql.parquet`.`path/to/parquet/files` as p\n```\n\nThis was resolved by an `Analyzer` rule: `ResolveDataSource`. Thus, it should not exist after finishing `Analyzer`. Thus, it is ok to keep enforcing the existing naming rule, if we do not validate the names in `databaseExists` and `tableExists`. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases for ensuring the coverage.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T20:16:24Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T04:19:11Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T04:19:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54a7fc4ef590e6d5c7c4a4e29d176546a06e7767","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:nameValidation","ref":"nameValidation","sha":"54a7fc4ef590e6d5c7c4a4e29d176546a06e7767","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

specified in [SPARK-14849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14849), the `address` in the `NettyRpcEnv` for the executor is not set when running in standalone mode. To compensate, the driver try to guess the IP address of the executor during registration. But in a NAT situation, the IP address visible in the connection is not the one that should be used.\nThis address is sent back to the executor, and used later to describe the location of blocks.\n\nThe change is too always set the address as the `host` value, and to remove the code on the driver side which is trying to guess the right IP address.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR introduces a new accumulator API  which is much simpler than before:\n1. the type hierarchy is simplified, now we only have an `Accumulator` class\n2. Combine `initialValue` and `zeroValue` concepts into just one concept: `zeroValue`\n3. there in only one `register` method, the accumulator registration and cleanup registration are combined.\n4. the `id`,`name` and `countFailedValues` are combined into an `AccumulatorMetadata`, and is provided during registration.\n\n`SQLMetric` is a good example to show the simplicity of this new API.\n\nWhat we break:\n1. no `setValue` anymore. In the new API, the intermedia type can be different from the result type, it's very hard to implement a general `setValue`\n2. accumulator can't be serialized before registered.\n\nProblems need to be addressed in follow-ups:\n1. with this new API, `AccumulatorInfo` doesn't make a lot of sense, the partial output is not partial updates, we need to expose the intermediate value.\n2. `ExceptionFailure` should not carry the accumulator updates. Why do users care about accumulator updates for failed cases? It looks like we only use this feature to update the internal metrics, how about we sending a heartbeat to update internal metrics after the failure event?\n3. the public event `SparkListenerTaskEnd` carries a `TaskMetrics`. Ideally this `TaskMetrics` don't need to carry external accumulators, as the only method of `TaskMetrics` that can access external accumulators is `private[spark]`. However, `SQLListener` use it to retrieve sql metrics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T14:55:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-07T03:02:14Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T07:28:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c32f0a49077ea933424bdf022da24027065c45b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/124568b3eeb7e0a657b2fbe4f54bb85543b7ffa3","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:acc","ref":"acc","sha":"124568b3eeb7e0a657b2fbe4f54bb85543b7ffa3","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe use `RowEncoder` in libsvm data source to serialize the label and features read from libsvm files. However, the schema passed in this encoder is not correct. As the result, we can't correctly select `features` column from the DataFrame. We should use full data schema instead of `requiredSchema` to serialize the data read in. Then do projection to select required columns later.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`LibSVMRelationSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T13:50:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:35Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T17:13:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4119385b341696ab3845eb1ea626dfd08034f6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5777ee5b6bd1016d652e55394a387fc728accba0","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-libsvm","ref":"fix-libsvm","sha":"5777ee5b6bd1016d652e55394a387fc728accba0","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe deprecated  `runs` of mllib.KMeans in Spark 1.6 (SPARK-11358). In 2.0, we will make it no effect (with warning messages). We did not remove `setRuns/getRuns` for better binary compatibility.\nThis PR change `runs` which are appeared at the public API. Usage inside of `KMeans.runAlgorithm()` will be resolved at #10806. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests.\n\ncc @jkbradley

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a follow-up to #12557, with the following changes:\n1. Fixes some of the style issues.\n2. Merges Signaling and SignalLogger into a new class called SignalUtils. It was pretty confusing to have Signaling and Signal in one file, and it was also confusing to have two classes named Signaling and one called the other.\n3. Made logging registration idempotent.\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch tests Python ML persistence integration. \n- Add persistency tests of CrossValidator(TrainValidationSplit(LogisticRegression)) and TrainValidationSplit(CrossValidator(LogisticRegression)).\n- Enhance `_compare_pipelines` with checking of CrossValidator, CrossValidatorModel, TrainValidationSplit, TrainValidationSplitModel, OneVsRest, OneVsRestModel.\n\n**Bugs found and fixed in this PR:**\n- OneVsRest, CrossValidator and TrainValidationSplit should have `_transfer_param_map_to_java` and `_transfer_param_map_from_java`, otherwise they can't be used as estimators in tuning.\n\n``` scala\nlr = LogisticRegression()\nlr.getThresholds()\n```\n\nproduces `keyNotFoundError` because thresholds neither be set nor in `_defaultParamMap`, which leads the previous JavaParams parameter equality check error.\n- `trainRatio` in `TrainValidationSplit` should have float type converter.\n- `OneVsRest` with `classifier` in `estimatorParamMaps` of tuning fail to persistence. I.e.\n\n``` scala\novr = OneVsRest()\nepms = [{ovr.classifier: xxxx}, {ovr.classifier: xxx}]\ncv = CrossValidator(estimator=ovr, estimatorParamMaps=epms, ...)\ncv.load()\n```\n\nfails because classifier cannot be serialized via JSON.\n\nThe last one is not trivial, so I left it unsolved in this PR. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe patch tests with Python unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T07:04:05Z","updated_at":"2016-05-01T23:26:12Z","closed_at":"2016-05-01T05:37:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7ad985db2581a1bb15f1106b51f927a72c19491","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cdab34a8a995eb124059208011d58621b7ba1eb8","head":{"label":"yinxusen:SPARK-14706","ref":"SPARK-14706","sha":"cdab34a8a995eb124059208011d58621b7ba1eb8","user":{"login":"yinxusen","id":2637239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzcyMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2637239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen","html_url":"https://github.com/yinxusen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17233732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMzczMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"yinxusen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yinxusen","id":2637239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzcyMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2637239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen","html_url":"https://github.com/yinxusen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yinxusen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis change modifies the implementation of DataFrameWriter.save such that it works with jdbc, and the call to jdbc merely delegates to save. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis was tested via unit tests in the JDBCWriteSuite, of which I added one new test to cover this scenario.\n## Additional details\n\n@rxin This seems to have been most recently touched by you and was also commented on in the JIRA. \n\nThis contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSparkPlan.prepare() could be called in different threads (BroadcastExchange will call it in a thread pool), it only make sure that doPrepare() will only be called once, the second call to prepare() may return earlier before all the children had finished prepare(). Then some operator may call doProduce() before prepareSubqueries(), `null` will be used as the result of subquery, which is wrong. This cause TPCDS Q23B returns wrong answer sometimes.\n\nThis PR added synchronization for prepare(), make sure all the children had finished prepare() before return. Also call prepare() in produce() (similar to execute()).\n\nAdded checking for ScalarSubquery to make sure that the subquery has finished before using the result.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested with Q23B, no wrong answer anymore.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T05:01:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T19:54:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T19:31:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03aabec0a26b5f34eb4c44bdff1df6657464fbfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e00d80cd937f6217797d443b034aa18a5094937d","head":{"label":"davies:fix_risk","ref":"fix_risk","sha":"e00d80cd937f6217797d443b034aa18a5094937d","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nObserved stackOverflowError in Kryo when executing TPC-DS Query27. Spark thrift server disables kryo reference tracking (if not specified in conf). When \"spark.kryo.referenceTracking\" is set to true explicitly in spark-defaults.conf, query executes successfully. The root cause is that the TaskMemoryManager inside MemoryConsumer and LongToUnsafeRowMap were not transient and thus were serialized and broadcast around from within LongHashedRelation, which could potentially cause circular reference inside Kryo. But the TaskMemoryManager is per task and should not be passed around at the first place. This fix makes it transient. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\ncore/test, hive/test, sql/test, catalyst/test, dev/lint-scala, org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveCompatibilitySuite, dev/scalastyle,\nmanual test of TBC-DS Query 27 with 1GB data but without the \"limit 100\" which would cause a NPE due to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n<copy form JIRA>\n\nCurrently if neither `spark.yarn.jars` nor `spark.yarn.archive` is set (by default), Spark on yarn code will upload all the jars in the folder separately into distributed cache, this is quite time consuming, and very verbose, instead of upload jars separately into distributed cache, here changes to zip all the jars first, and then put into distributed cache.\n\nThis will significantly improve the speed of starting time.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test and local integrated test is done.\n\nVerified with SparkPi both in spark cluster and client mode.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T03:09:05Z","updated_at":"2016-04-28T23:41:45Z","closed_at":"2016-04-28T23:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b738819481557ca5f1f53cc73db5197f86a16568","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62639a21f51c06851822765e4256ab0cc9a3d19e","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-14836","ref":"SPARK-14836","sha":"62639a21f51c06851822765e4256ab0cc9a3d19e","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

of [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11965] for branch-1.6.\nThere were no merge conflicts.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nStringIndexerModel.transform sets the output column metadata to use name inputCol.  It should not.  Fixing this causes a problem with the metadata produced by RFormula.\n\nFix in RFormula: I added the StringIndexer columns to prefixesToRewrite, and I modified VectorAttributeRewriter to find and replace all \"prefixes\" since attributes collect multiple prefixes from StringIndexer + Interaction.\n\nNote that \"prefixes\" is no longer accurate since internal strings may be replaced.\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore, spark.ml GaussianMixtureModel used the spark.mllib MultivariateGaussian in its public API.  This was added after 1.6, so we can modify this API without breaking APIs.\n\nThis PR copies MultivariateGaussian to mllib-local in spark.ml, with a few changes:\n- Renamed fields to match numpy, scipy: mu => mean, sigma => cov\n\nThis PR then uses the spark.ml MultivariateGaussian in the spark.ml GaussianMixtureModel, which involves:\n- Modifying the constructor\n- Adding a computeProbabilities method\n\nAlso:\n- Added EPSILON to mllib-local for use in MultivariateGaussian\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent StreamTest allows testing of a streaming Dataset generated explicitly wraps a source. This is different from the actual production code path where the source object is dynamically created through a DataSource object every time a query is started. So all the fault-tolerance testing in FileSourceSuite and FileSourceStressSuite is not really testing the actual code path as they are just reusing the FileStreamSource object. \n\nThis PR fixes StreamTest and the FileSource***Suite to test this correctly. Instead of maintaining a mapping of source --> expected offset in StreamTest (which requires reuse of source object), it now maintains a mapping of source index --> offset, so that it is independent of the source object.\n\nSummary of changes\n- StreamTest refactored to keep track of offset by source index instead of source\n- AddData, AddTextData and AddParquetData updated to find the FileStreamSource object from an active query, so that it can work with sources generated when query is started.\n- Refactored unit tests in FileSource***Suite to test using DataFrame/Dataset generated with public, rather than reusing the same FileStreamSource. This correctly tests fault tolerance.\n\nThe refactoring changed a lot of indents in FileSourceSuite, so its recommended to hide whitespace changes with this - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12592/files?w=1\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRefactored unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T01:06:13Z","updated_at":"2016-04-24T04:54:53Z","closed_at":"2016-04-24T04:54:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c052206931ff2dfe6c06a1d9cd2d8962ead74624","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/532a69ccd6938f3d3e4ddbd8ec44d8c2962afe80","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-14833","ref":"SPARK-14833","sha":"532a69ccd6938f3d3e4ddbd8ec44d8c2962afe80","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen creating a file stream using sqlContext.write.stream(), existing files are scanned twice for finding the schema \n- Once, when creating a DataSource + StreamingRelation in the DataFrameReader.stream()\n- Again, when creating streaming Source from the DataSource, in DataSource.createSource()\n\nInstead, the schema should be generated only once, at the time of creating the dataframe, and when the streaming source is created, it should just reuse that schema\n\nThe solution proposed in this PR is to add a lazy field in DataSource that caches the schema. Then streaming Source created by the DataSource can just reuse the schema. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRefactored unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T00:55:04Z","updated_at":"2016-04-23T00:19:30Z","closed_at":"2016-04-23T00:19:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50e16280be9f4c00be88968a3663e9b66ba759f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8efc38a6004d7c782f73673ece7c66100222cc3","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-14832","ref":"SPARK-14832","sha":"f8efc38a6004d7c782f73673ece7c66100222cc3","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd methods to get `Try` and `Option` types from a `Row`. The code is _not merge ready_. But I was not sure how I could get feedback without a PR. I've added two major methods to Row, `attempt`\nand `getOption`. The former returns a `Try` while the latter returns an `Option`.\n- `attempt` was added after a comment was made in PR #10247, where it was suggested I not return None when certain exceptions are thrown. But in my opinion, throwing exceptions from a function which returns an `Option` is not a good use case.\n- I am not in love with the name `attempt`. Would welcome suggestions. I wanted to use `try` but it's a keyword.\n- In `RowTest`, the tests testing for `ClassCastException` fail. I am not sure what I am doing wrong in the code here. Would appreciate feedback.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests have been added to `RowTest` to test the newly added methods.\n","created_at":"2016-04-21T23:47:39Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T20:03:18Z","closed_at":"2016-04-26T20:03:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"08413489ce4a76bffa77803510f4cb03bee02781","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12587/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12587/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12587/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce4cc720f503a4cdf6e59081bec3ccc8fb1dc818","head":{"label":"aa8y:master","ref":"master","sha":"ce4cc720f503a4cdf6e59081bec3ccc8fb1dc818","user":{"login":"aa8y","id":5642392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y","html_url":"https://github.com/aa8y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56792591,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Njc5MjU5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"aa8y/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aa8y","id":5642392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NDIzOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5642392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y","html_url":"https://github.com/aa8y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aa8y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aa8y/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch moves analyze table parsing into SparkSqlAstBuilder and removes HiveSqlAstBuilder.\n\nIn order to avoid extensive refactoring, I created a common trait for CatalogRelation and MetastoreRelation, and match on that. In the future we should probably just consolidate the two into a single thing so we don't need this common trait.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated unit

users to issue \"`SHOW CREATE TABLE`\" command natively in SparkSQL. \n-- For tables that are created by Hive, this command will display the DDL in hive syntax. If the syntax includes `CLUSTERED BY, SKEWED BY or STORED BY` clause, there will be a warning message saying that this DDL is not supported in SparkSQL native DDL yet. \n\n-- For tables that are created by datasource DDL, such as \"`CREATE TABLE...

It is proposed to display create table in the dataframe API format, such as `<DataFarme>.write.partitionBy(\"a\").bucketBy(\"c\").format(\"parquet\").saveAsTable(\"T1\")`\n## How was this patch

discussed in [SPARK-14489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14489), when using `ALSModel` to predict on a test set, the model returns `NaN` when the user/item is in the test set but not the training set, since the model has not computed factor(s) for that user and/or item. \n\nThis PR adds support to `RegressionEvaluator` to drop rows where the value of `predictionCol` is `NaN`. This should not be used in the general case (since a bad regression model may produce a lot of `NaN`s and one would not want to ignore those but rather fix the underlying issue), but allows ALS to be used in cross-validation settings even when this situation occurs (which may be quite common on larger, sparser datasets). Thus it is an `expertParam` and the default is `false`. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew unit tests in `RegressionEvaluatorSuite` and doc string tests in `evaluation.py`.\n\ncc @srowen @sethah

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes a bug in EliminateSerialization rule in Catalyst Optimizer. When there is a SerializeFromObject and DeserializeToObject pair with equal inputObjectType and outputObjectType, the pair will be eliminated and replaced by a Project operator. However, when the involved object type is Row, there will be a codegen compilation error, because UnsafeProjection does not support Row.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

SQL's POM hardcodes a dependency on `spark-sketch_2.11`, which causes Scala 2.10 builds to include the `_2.11` dependency. This is harmless since `spark-sketch` is a pure-Java module (see #12334 for a discussion of dropping the Scala version suffixes from these modules' artifactIds), but it's confusing to people looking at the published POMs.\n\nThis patch fixes this by using `${scala.binary.version}` to substitute the correct suffix, and also adds a set of Maven Enforcer rules to ensure that `_2.11` artifacts are not used in 2.10 builds (and vice-versa).\n\n/cc @ahirreddy, who spotted this issue.\n","created_at":"2016-04-21T06:40:21Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T19:27:27Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T16:59:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90020e6b63b0182af911c82fc2908e878789cbe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9dad944ddde583fc0c52f516f350deb844911c45","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:fix-sketch-scala-version","ref":"fix-sketch-scala-version","sha":"9dad944ddde583fc0c52f516f350deb844911c45","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCode generation for complex type, `CreateArray`, `CreateMap`, `CreateStruct`, `CreateNamedStruct`, exceeds JVM size limit for large elements.\n\nWe should split generated code into multiple `apply` functions if the complex types have large elements,  like `UnsafeProjection` or others for large expressions.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added some tests to check if the generated codes for the expressions exceed or not.\n","created_at":"2016-04-21T05:24:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T04:44:42Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T04:21:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25afdea1bec8db9aea1328f2b504abc7f26c7d3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6c037d0f477edbd0597fecce08aa23f96d925e6c","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-14793","ref":"issues/SPARK-14793","sha":"6c037d0f477edbd0597fecce08aa23f96d925e6c","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

signal is forwarded to the default handler resulting in the usual termination of the application.\n\nThis PR is a rewrite of -- and therefore closes #8216 -- as per @piaozhexiu's request\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nSignal handling is not easily testable therefore no unit tests were added. Nevertheless, the new functionality is implemented in a best-effort approach, soft-failing in case signals aren't available on a specific OS.\n","created_at":"2016-04-21T03:39:56Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T07:27:55Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T05:06:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"174b25d6d50d4fb6a18cebfecd7fb24f0223f9f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f9bf695344a5c4c54372eaa6bf54af0d2da1f74","head":{"label":"jodersky:SPARK-10001-sigint","ref":"SPARK-10001-sigint","sha":"4f9bf695344a5c4c54372eaa6bf54af0d2da1f74","user":{"login":"jodersky","id":1007012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky","html_url":"https://github.com/jodersky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8045814114d41dc17130ebc71f9e48d28ca959ca","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSbt compile and test should also run scalastyle. This makes it less likely you forget to run scalastyle and fail in jenkins. Scalastyle results are cached for efficiency.\n\nThis patch was originally written by @ahirreddy; I just fixed it up to work with scalastyle 0.8.0.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually with `build/sbt

`hive` subproject currently depends on `hive-cli` in order to perform a check to see whether a `SessionState` is an instance of `org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.CliSessionState` (see #9589). The introduction of this `hive-cli` dependency has caused problems for users whose Hive metastore JAR classpaths don't include the `hive-cli` classes (such as in #11495).\n\nThis patch removes this dependency on `hive-cli` and replaces the `isInstanceOf` check by reflection. I added a Maven Enforcer rule to ban `hive-cli` from the `hive` subproject in order to make sure that this dependency is not accidentally reintroduced.\n\n/cc @rxin @yhuai @adrian-wang

make all dependencies in the examples module provided, and explicitly\nlist a couple of ones that somehow are promoted to compile by maven.

HBase has had Spark bindings for\na while and is even including them in the HBase distribution in the next\nversion, making the examples obsolete. The same applies to Cassandra, which\nseems to have a proper Spark binding library already.\n\nI just tested the build, which passes, and ran SparkPi.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe path rewrite in TestHiveSparkSession is pretty hacky. I think we can remove those complexity and just do a string replacement when we read the query files in. This would remove the overloading of runNativeSql in TestHive, which will simplify the removal of Hive specific variable substitution.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a small test refactoring to simplify test infrastructure.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T22:45:11Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T00:58:17Z","closed_at":"2016-04-21T00:58:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9af932857d5135eade19e16d636404a862f916ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f0416906f2450741c771ac6145cce57a9cc6e99e","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14775","ref":"SPARK-14775","sha":"f0416906f2450741c771ac6145cce57a9cc6e99e","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, a column could be resolved wrongly if there are columns from both outer table and subquery have the same name, we should only resolve the attributes that can't be resolved within subquery. They may have same exprId than other attributes in subquery, so we should create alias for them.\n\nAlso, the column in IN subquery could have same exprId, we should create alias for them.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression tests. Manually tests TPCDS Q70 and Q95, work well after this patch.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T22:03:42Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T18:57:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T18:57:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb82b626c9cd41e9f1a0ec297be414e451dc501d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd8c75cfbc847c29ba313fce5f43903396714356","head":{"label":"davies:fix_subquery","ref":"fix_subquery","sha":"fd8c75cfbc847c29ba313fce5f43903396714356","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn order to fully merge the Hive parser and the SQL parser, we'd need to support variable substitution in Spark. The implementation of the substitute algorithm is mostly copied from Hive, but I simplified the overall structure quite a bit and added more comprehensive test coverage.\n\nNote that this pull request does not yet use this functionality anywhere.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded VariableSubstitutionSuite for unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**Background**\nYesterday, when I exposed a function to Python/R, only Python and R module are changed. At the first successful build, it took 25 minutes, but the next one took 125 minutes.\n- [25 minutes](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/56291/consoleFull)\n\n```\n[info] Found the following changed modules: pyspark-sql, sparkr\n```\n- [125 minutes](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/56298/)\n\n```\n[info] Found the following changed modules: pyspark-sql, sparkr, mllib, hive, sql, root\n```\n\n**Problem**\n`identify_changed_files_from_git_commits` function in `run-tests.py` simply runs `git diff` to the master. It means **Newly updated master code** also are considered as the changed files due to the PR.\n\n**How to fix**\nActually, the value of `patch_sha` is `HEAD`. Also, we are using Github merged commits (consisting of 2 commits), we can find the changed file like the following.\n\n```\n-    raw_output = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff', '--name-only', patch_sha, diff_target],\n+    raw_output = subprocess.check_output(['git', 'diff', '--name-only', 'HEAD~2'],\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T18:30:56Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T07:33:54Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T21:25:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a2dae07d9a6aec888480fd584ae260c42d95683","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/808ae6bb7695bb7ad77244373092c3660da89fcb","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-14765","ref":"SPARK-14765","sha":"808ae6bb7695bb7ad77244373092c3660da89fcb","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7bc948557bb6169cbeec335f8400af09375a62d3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13973\n\nFollowing discussion with @srowen the IPYTHON and IPYTHON_OPTS variables are removed. If they are set in the user's environment, pyspark will not execute and prints an error message. Failing noisily will force users to remove these options and learn the new configuration scheme, which is much more sustainable and less confusing.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing; set IPYTHON=1 and verified that the error message prints.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T13:46:14Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T09:16:56Z","closed_at":"2016-04-30T09:16:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e54f0c980a440c075b299730ec9208a0b49c2f0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/430dc7602761c8c3c27692a7eda0673cd3247593","head":{"label":"shearerpmm:master","ref":"master","sha":"430dc7602761c8c3c27692a7eda0673cd3247593","user":{"login":"shearerpmm","id":7192213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTIyMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7192213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm","html_url":"https://github.com/shearerpmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shearerpmm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6d5aeaae264579673bb75d32a8e4cd96aad9cf83","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

PR is a rebased version of PR #12153.)\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds preliminary locality support for `FileFormat` data sources by overriding `FileScanRDD.preferredLocations()`. The strategy can be divided into two parts:\n1.  Block location lookup\n   \n   Unlike `HadoopRDD` or `NewHadoopRDD`, `FileScanRDD` doesn't have access to the underlying `InputFormat` or `InputSplit`, and thus can't rely on `InputSplit.getLocations()` to gather locality information. Instead, this PR queries block locations using `FileSystem.getBlockLocations()` after listing all `FileStatus`es in `HDFSFileCatalog` and convert all `FileStatus`es into `LocatedFileStatus`es.\n   \n   Note that although S3/S3A/S3N file systems don't provide valid locality information, their `getLocatedStatus()` implementations don't actually issue remote calls either. So there's no need to special case these file systems.\n2.  Selecting preferred locations\n   \n   For each `FilePartition`, we pick up top 3 locations that containing the most data to be retrieved. This isn't necessarily the best algorithm out there. Further improvements may be brought up in follow-up PRs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by overriding default `FileSystem` implementation for `file:///` with a mocked one, which returns mocked block locations.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T13:29:10Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T06:25:50Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T04:50:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4911da58eb869c52bebaf9690f3a42793c1c127","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b36e97aafec3b11132426ffb550f2188c28f787","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14369-locality-rebased","ref":"spark-14369-locality-rebased","sha":"2b36e97aafec3b11132426ffb550f2188c28f787","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror
