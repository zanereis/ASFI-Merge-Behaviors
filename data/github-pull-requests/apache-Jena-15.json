shows two things:\r\n\r\n1. checking urn:uuid was broken (4.0.0 adds checking of UUIDs).\r\n1. IRI problems should be warnings (parsing does not stop).\r\n\r\nOnly IRI syntax that is broken to the point where `<>` can't be matched or impossible characters (e.g. space) are used should be a parse-stop error as it was in jena 3.17.0, especially for N-Triples.\r\n\r\nTo this end, add a test suite `TestIRIxRIOT` that has test cases for all the situations, checking the numbers of errors and warning produced for the new IRIx abstraction use in RIOT parsing.\r\n\r\nRelative IRIs are now a special case with their own exception `RelativeIRIException`. Some formats (N-Triples when not strict) accept them. Turtle always resolves them (and there is always a base) unless specific low-level setup is done when it can be a parse-stop error.\r\n\r\nBehaviour in normal use should be like 3.17.0 with only possible changes of ERROR to WARN in messages. Behaviour in detailed setup for Turtle now has test

This means that providing the same features of union default and filter is done in the same style and that timeout abort is handled the same way.\r\n\r\nOld classes used for BGP solving is deprecated,not removed.\r\n\r\nMuch of the code is not \"new\" so much as TDB code backported to work on `Nodes`.\r\n\r\nIncludes other work:\r\n\r\n* [JENA-2082](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-2082): Single test manifest runner.\r\n* [JENA-2090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-2090): Add Graph.stream\r\n* [JENA-2091](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-2091): Add methods Graph.add(s,p,o) and .delete(s,p,o)\r\n\r\nWhat is included is switching on quad+node execution. There is an `OpExecutorQuad` but it is not active.\r\n\r\nThe intention is switch to have TIM to use this quad execution.\r\n\r\nThen all the storage datasets (TIM, TDB1 TDB2) have the same feature set provided in the same style.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-15T11:43:14Z","updated_at":"2021-04-22T18:10:12Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T18:10:08Z","merged_at":"2021-04-22T18:10:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"e41904eea2315ed8f3cb121c4e5f0cad4ffd4fe6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/d2a1806a9a98f7c409c6f0567890158be8556147","head":{"label":"afs:jena2088-solver","ref":"jena2088-solver","sha":"d2a1806a9a98f7c409c6f0567890158be8556147","user":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53279870,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzI3OTg3MA==","name":"jena","full_name":"afs/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"afs","id":101362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs","html_url":"https://github.com/afs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/afs/jena","description":"Mirror

href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.1\">Guava 30.1</a>'s warning log message for running <code>guava-android</code> under a Java 7 VM. (Android VMs are unaffected.) If the warning <em>itself</em> causes you trouble, you can eliminate it by silencing the logger for <code>com.google.common.base.Preconditions</code> (which is used <em>only</em> for this warning). This warning prepares for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5269\">removing support for Java 7 in 2021</a>. Please report any problems. We have tried to make the warning as safe as possible, but anytime a common library logs, especially as aggressively as we do in this new release, there is the potential for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/41017717/28465\"><code>NullPointerException</code></a> or even <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/48009613/28465\">deadlock</a>. (To be clear, Guava will not log under Java 8 or Android, but it will under Java 7.)

is work inspired by parsing wikidata with Jena3, finding all the types of warnings and errors that arise then making the new code agree with Jena3, except where newer RFCs have changed the situation (e.g. percent encoding in DNS host names is now legal). The code also reflect jena's behaviour of warning about bad IRIs but not signalling a parse error - very large datasets have some less-than-perfect IRIs in them and aborting a load because of this is annoying.\r\n\r\nTests added to pin down expectations.\r\n\r\nThere is also a lot of clearing up and refactoring.\r\n\r\nPerformance checked: the Jena3 and Jena4 times to parse (BSBM data) are the

this is a big PR, most of the files changed are because all uses of binding in Jena have been converted to the new code. The old way (`BindingMap`) still works.\r\n\r\nWhile making these changes, the process was to change some files to new style, then run the tests suite so that if behaviour changed, it was simpler to track down whether it was the translation of the usage code or the binding sub-system implementation.\r\n\r\nThe old style is still there in `BindingFactory` as deprecated static methods to smooth migration. The original classes in case for code using the classes directly and not via the factory.\r\n\r\nThe key new class is `BindingBuilder`.\r\n\r\nThe main change in code is `BindingMap
