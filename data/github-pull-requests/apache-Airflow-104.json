endpoint `GET /config` always returns all config\r\nIt would be nice if we can expose a way to get a single section of the config\r\nusing rest API.\r\nThis PR add a query param `section` in the existing `GET /config` API\r\nif the section query param given by a user does not exist then the API throws an error\r\nif a section exists and return that section only\r\nand if the user call API without section param then return all config.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

has two methods, `get_key` and `get_wildcard_key`, which use an AWS `ServiceResource` to fetch object data from S3. Both methods are correctly documented as returning an instance of `S3.Object`, but their return types are annotated with `S3Transfer`. This is incorrect. The actual return type, `S3.Object`, is not a subtype of `S3Transfer`, and the two types have many different methods.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the `mypy-boto3-s3` package to set a correct return type of S3

airflow community,\r\nthis is my fifth PR and be happy to work DAG parsing runtime. We faced an issue with slow dag parsing if DAG has huge amount of dagruns and DB query is slow down the run time during DAG parsing. Then the DAG parsing was skipped due to long running query and this is not required if DAG is not scheduled. I think DAGs  which are not scheduled have biggest change to have huge number dagruns and this save runtime during this use case.\r\n\r\nThis PR will check is the DAG is not scheduled and then skips

standalone file processor as of #30278 introduced accidentally an artifficial delay between dag processing by adding heartbeat but missing to set \"only_if_necessary\" flag to True.\r\n\r\nIf your dag file processing has been fast (faster than the scheduler job_heartbeat_sec) this introduced unnecessary pause between the next dag file processor loop (up until the time passed), it also introduced inflation of the\r\ndag_processing_last_duration metrics (it would always show minimum job_heartbeat_sec)\r\n\r\nAdding \"only_if_necessary\" flag fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nFixes: #30593\r\nFixes:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/29531\r\nI propose a solution in which I check all previously mapped tasks for one task_id as one whole dependency for the current mapped task since we can have different amounts of mapped tasks, and if the current dag run has more mapped tasks and there is no such index in the previous dag run, it is difficult to understand that the previous dag run really doesn't have such an index or tasks haven't been expanded yet. Also, I think if tasks have the same map_index, it aren't guaranteed that they do the same work and it's better to wait until all mapped tasks in the past finish.","created_at":"2023-04-26T20:00:44Z","updated_at":"2023-06-17T00:11:48Z","closed_at":"2023-06-17T00:11:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aea45584ec69cdfb26b0aca8c8fb341a5c16cece","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

It is a delta value, not the absolute value, and that can lead to _very_ difficult interpretation of what this metric actually means.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the data this metric emits, it's sometimes negative (which doesn't seem to make a huge amount of sense since it's the \"count\" of dag processing processes spun off by `processor.py`). I don't claim this change to be the best rephrasing, but I thought it'd make sense to have a convo on this pull itself to figure out the best solution.","created_at":"2023-04-26T18:59:45Z","updated_at":"2023-05-08T10:56:09Z","closed_at":"2023-05-04T09:28:23Z","merged_at":"2023-05-04T09:28:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"963717047125e96f3e704eeb3a84110d283985c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3508325829,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK287RHM3F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:doc-only","name":"type:doc-only","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

was several problems with the current implementation:\r\n\r\n- it was only fetching 1 response from the logs, so if the job was producing a lot of logs, it'd lag further and further back in time (and possibly never catch up)\r\n- if the job was marked as failed, it was jumping from one stream to an other without warning, and started filtering on exceptions and errors, providing a very weird experience to someone who'd use those to debug\r\n- upon changing log streams, the continuation token was not reset, so that behavior was not working anyway (you cannot use a continuation token from a stream when reading from another)\r\n- upon checking the different log streams available (/output and /error), I realized that it was not clear cut at all. A stack trace could go in /output, and some INFO logs were in /error, so I think it has value to have both streams if one wants to understand what's happening.\r\n\r\nRegarding the fact that we now display both streams, I hesitated between interleaving messages from both, sorting by timestamp, or leaving them separated. I ended up choosing to have them separated to keep the experience consistent with what the user would see in cloudwatch, but I'd be happy to change that to chronological order if people think it's better.\r\n\r\nAlso: added it to the system test (for better visibility for users) + added utest\r\n\r\ncc @ferruzzi

that #30032 is merged, we can update the deferrable implementation for `RedshiftResumeClusterOperator` to use custom aiobotocore waiters , as well as the `async_conn` to simplify deferrable implmentation, and reduce code duplication.

Airflow checks whether there is some “blocking” trigger by creating a watchdog procedure. This watchdog procedure is very simple; it waits asynchronously 0.1 seconds and then checks if more than 0.2 sec elapsed. If so it logs and reports an Error, which is probably a bit harsh, and is likely to provide false positives.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that badly written triggerer will be reported with this procedure there could be a multitude of reasons for the procedure to yield the error, while nothing erroneous happens. Among other situations it is possible that a highly utilized environment with many triggers will not be able to fit within 0.2 sec time frame.\r\n\r\nThis idea is to measure the time spend in each trigger and message to the user only those that actually took too much time.","created_at":"2023-04-25T10:28:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-12T13:24:43Z","closed_at":"2023-06-12T13:24:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"764d149cd220624344ae9dba7b1ecc9987e1f7d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PRs that are just changing selected providers, there is no need to install and verify all providers, just those affected should be installed (and full verification should only be done when all providers are being built - so generally speaking, when Core PRs are run or when canary builds are run.\r\n\r\nThis PR distinguishes those two cases:\r\n\r\n* installing and verification when all providers are selected\r\n* installing only affected providers when only subset of them are affected\r\n\r\nAlso a bug was found where core file changes did not trigger provider docs build during implementation.

airflow community,\r\nthis is my third PR and be happy to work on the scheduler runtime again. We faced an issue with slow scheduler execution time by having millions of queued dag_runs for one DAG.\r\n\r\nI found out that the query next_dagruns_to_examine needs many seconds to be executed with huge amount of dag_runs. I was able to drop the execution time to some ms by using this Index. This was really a big jump in the performance of the scheduler. Can someone support me how to get this into the migration scripts? What are you thinking about this

context, I'm a pretty new developer, but I personally had a bit of a hard time parsing the [Quick Start](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html) instructions with them in one giant code block and instead thought they were actually some sort of configuration file. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85081861/232335344-a1828b47-9657-423f-8be5-ac38375e2bc9.png)\r\n\r\nThe four changes that I'm suggesting in this all relate to the instructions found in the code block, they are - \r\n\r\n1. Breaking the code block up by step\r\n\r\n2. Including a note about setting the AIRFLOW_HOME variable before installation. This is pretty small but I think was part of what contributed to me being confused that this is not a config file as I'm not too used to setting environment variables for an application I haven't installed before.\r\n\r\n3. On step two, making a note/more explicit how the URL and constraint file ties together. That language of \"Install Airflow using the constraints file\", once I understood what was happening made total sense, but having the text be a bit more verbose would have saved me some time. My understanding at this time, which could be wrong (in which case I think that text still needs to be updated) is that our URL being passed will determine what constraint file to use.\r\n\r\n4. Making a note that the PYTHON_VERSION is being extracted as well as setting it manually if the user is running python 3.11 on their machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
