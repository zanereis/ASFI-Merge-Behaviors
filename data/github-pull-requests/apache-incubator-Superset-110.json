SUMMARY\r\nCurrently simple filters aren't always translated to valid custom SQL:\r\n- strings aren't enclosed in quotes (quotes were only added in the case of set operators)\r\n- all set operator clauses were enclosed in quotes (should not be the case for numeric values)\r\n- single quotes aren't doubly quoted as per ANSI SQL (`it's a word` -> `col = 'it''s a word'`)\r\n- when only a subject or subject and operator are given, the custom filter is left empty\r\n\r\nSome test cases are added and code slightly refactored.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNew tests added and old tests updated accordingly. The variables in the tests are replaced with explicit values to make them easier to read.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nFixes an excessive z-index of the spinning loader indicator which was causing the loading indicator to appear over the header.\r\nThe z-index was increased in this PR  #10105 to avoid the spinner showing up under the filters. Testing shows the new z-index is high enough to prevent that issue from presenting itself again.\r\n\r\nCloses #12298 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![before-Sales-Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/103928810-a68b1900-511c-11eb-93b8-3e92774bf528.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![after-Sales-Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/103928830-abe86380-511c-11eb-8455-eb7de8100ec2.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nThe Antd Popover has a z-index at 1030. By adding the option `menuPortalTarget` as `document.body` to the Select, the dropdowns (both single-choice and multi-choice) show behind the Popover. One fix could have been to reduce the default z-index of the Antd Popover but we don't know what side effects this might cause. This PR instead raises the z-index of the outer div of the dropdowns to be the same as the Antd Popover. This should be a safer approach as dropdowns must usually appear over elements.\r\n\r\nCloses #12309 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Explore---cases_ts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/103912985-4c805880-5108-11eb-8906-29bdc9450293.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![Explore---FCC-2018-Survey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/103911218-0c1fdb00-5106-11eb-90fe-16432273d6d5.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes dashboard export when the dashboard has 1+ orphan charts.\r\n\r\nWhen a chart is added to an existing dashboard it's not added to the `position_json` attribute, and its position is implicit. When we export the dashboard we need to add the \"orphan\" charts to the dashboard's `position_json` so the relationship is preserved.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, this only works when `position_json` doesn't exist. But there might exist dashboards were `position_json` exists **and** the dashboard has orphan charts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTest locally.\r\n\r\n1. `npm link` both the core package and a plugin package.\r\n2. Start `npm dev-server`.\r\n4. Go to Chrome Dev Tools \"Sources\" panal, use `Cmd + p` to search for files.\r\n3.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe new examples, based on the import/export format, were loading data into the main database instead of the examples database. The code worked correctly when the two were identical, but at Preset we use 2 different databases and the data was loaded into the incorrect one.\r\n\r\nI fixed by explicitly calling `get_example_database()` in order to (1) check if the table already exists and, if not, (2) to create the table and load the data.\r\n\r\nNote that when the main and the example databases are the same we reuse the session connection, to make the import atomic. If they're different we warn the user (via logging) that the data import will happen outside the import transaction.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an issue described in a comment https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11968#issuecomment-747945240\r\nI wrapped table components in React.memo and removed unnecessary rerenders of copy to clipboard button.\r\nHowever, the biggest change is adding virtualization (react-window) for react-table, which improves the performance drastically for tables with many rows.\r\nHowever, due to how react-window works (which is wrapping row components in 2 divs) I had to stop using `<table>` and other table-related html tags in favour of divs, since the divs from `react-window` were breaking the table. Also, I needed to add a react-table plugin `useBlockLayout`, which requires the table cells to have fixed widths. The result is that we no longer benefit from cell widths being calculated by the browser, which is a huge bummer. I tried a few hacks to keep `<table>` tags (like wrapping divs generated by react-table in `<td>`), but all of them generated layout issues.\r\nI'd appreciate any suggestions on how I could improve this PR, especially when it comes to solving the issues with table layout!\r\nCC: @rusackas, @nytai, @ktmud, @villebro \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe changes are related

SUMMARY\r\nThe problem was that chart indicator did not match native filter indicator and this PR fixes that.\r\nBe aware that there is still filter component next to the charts. It is separated from the native filters, but has impact on the same charts. It also counts as \"Applied filter\".\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1388\" alt=\"indicator_1_before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47450693/103547414-aa146b00-4ea4-11eb-932c-1e5cee5f2ae1.png\">\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47450693/103547374-9cf77c00-4ea4-11eb-87d3-1c746e49b629.png)\r\n\r\nAfter: \r\n<img width=\"1388\" alt=\"indicator_1_after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47450693/103546888-f3b08600-4ea3-11eb-9a85-b52a89110fce.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1391\" alt=\"indicator_2_after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47450693/103546897-f6ab7680-4ea3-11eb-9980-78eb0451c479.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerify manually.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR pulls in a few fixes related to the `0.16` version of `superset-ui` and fixes a bug in the DeckGL viz plugins:\r\n\r\n- Bump to `@superset-ui/core` version `0.16.3` to bring in removal of the singular `queryData` property (see https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/874 by @simchaNielsen) and a fix to NVD3 and histogram chart control panels (https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/875).\r\n- Bump `@superset-ui/legacy-preset-chart-deckgl` to 0.4.0 to pull in changes required by `superset-ui` 0.16 version (see https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui-plugins-deckgl/pull/22).\r\n- Fix regression in DeckGL charts introduced by #11153 . See screenshots below.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nDeckGL charts weren't ordered by the main metric, causing data to often be ordered by either lon/lat.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/103510858-a960e200-4e6e-11eb-988f-b8ff82b4ce21.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter adding the original ordering prior to #11153 , DeckGL charts look normal again.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/103510909-bbdb1b80-4e6e-11eb-9adb-9ad3f4ba3ee1.png)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nApache changed policy on Github Actions because of [security risks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests). Now official apache repos can only run a list of allowed actions.\r\n\r\nCI has been blocked by this error:\r\n\r\n> styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.6.0 and apache-superset/cached-dependencies@b90713b are not allowed to be used in apache/incubator-superset. Actions in this workflow must be: created by GitHub, verified in the GitHub Marketplace, within a repository owned by apache or match the following: apache/*, dawidd6/action-download-artifact@*, gradle/wrapper-validation-action, gradle/wrapper-validation-action@*, peter-evans/create-pull-request@*, scacap/action-surefire-report@*, shivammathur/setup-php@*. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR unblocks CI by\r\n1. Remove `styfle/cancel-workflow-action`, which may soon become obsolete if #11944 gets merged\r\n1. Move all other external dependencies to be within current repo, including:\r\n    - [apache-superset/cached-dependencies](https://github.com/apache-superset/cached-dependencies) or ktmud/cached-dependencies\r\n    - [MorrisonCole/pr-lint-action](https://github.com/MorrisonCole/pr-lint-action)\r\n    - [unsplash/comment-on-pr](https://github.com/unsplash/comment-on-pr/tree/v1.2.0)\r\n    - [trilom/file-changes-action](https://github.com/trilom/file-changes-action/tree/v1.2.4)\r\n    \r\n    These actions were copied over via downloading them as ZIP files directly from GitHub.  All of these actions use the MIT license so I'd assume there is no licensing issue.\r\n1. Change `pull_request_target` trigger for the E2E action to `pull_request`. This is needed for unblocking the CI that runs on existing workflow configs. This will also prevent future Pwn requests and we don't plan to bring it back.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI should pass\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nHello, I am interested in contributing to Superset. Found issue #12149 and thought it would be a good way to learn the system.  If you would like me to create a separate issue for this, I can do that.\r\n\r\n#12149 wants to add an ErrorBoundary to specific components. I picked the ChartTable on the Welcome component, which I believe is the same as the **2nd item** under the **5. Home Page** mentioned in the issue. I replaced the root `React.Fragment (<>)` with an `ErrorBoundary`. I found the router logic and some other components using the `ErrorBoundary` this way.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nI wasn't sure how to proceed with testing or if it was desired. I didn't find any tests that tested the ErrorBoundary itself or any components that import it. The superset-ui repo has [some tests](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-core/test/chart/components/SuperChart.test.tsx#L49) I can take cues from. I'm more than happy to add tests, unless the ErrorBoundary is enough. Advice would be great!\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Progresses #12149 Fixes 5.2.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces an entirely new Icon system that uses a combination of the Antd Custom Icon and Emotion while consolidating the usage of icons.\r\n\r\n- Use existing Antd icons with the ability to enhance them\r\n- Use custom icons trough the Antd Custom Icon component and the ability to enhance them\r\n- Adds the ability to override any Antd existing icon with a custom one\r\n\r\nAs an example implementation, the following sections have been changed to use some of the icons under the new icon system:\r\n\r\n- Charts lists\r\n- Dashboards lists\r\n- Saved Queries lists\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nAdd support for defaultValue in Native Filters Config Modal per filter type.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Native Filters Config Modal\r\n- added `Select` to choose filter type (now supports only `Select` filter and `Range` filter)\r\n- added `SuperChart` that renders appropriate Native filter as default value selector\r\n- added `defaultValueQueries` to keep updated `queriesData` that will passed to `SuperChart`\r\n- added `defaultValueFormData` to keep updated form data that will passed `SuperChart`\r\n- dataset now managed by Ant forms\r\n\r\n2. Select Native filter \r\n- now works only with array default values \r\n\r\n3. Filter Bar\r\n- added `currentState` to `nativeFilters.filtersState` in redux to correct save and update `defaultValues` for resetAll case and others\r\n- `setExtraFormData` hook upgraded to pass `currentState`\r\n\r\nFlows:\r\n1. In Filters Config Modal\r\n- When change dataset -> reset column field -> reset default values\r\n- When change column field -> reset default values\r\n- When change filter type -> reset default values\r\n- When clicks allows multiple values -> reset default values\r\n\r\n2. In Filter Bar\r\n- When clicks `Reset all` should return to default values\r\n- When update some default value in Filters Config Modal, it should update also current value in Filter Bar\r\n\r\n###

No need check default values for `Range` filter (it should be fixed in other PR)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe current behavior for running CTAS (create table as select) in SQL Lab is to check for **each statement** if it's a `SELECT`, and if so prepend the query with `CREATE TABLE $table_name AS $query`. For example, if we have this query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT 1 AS col;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we run CTAS by passing the table name `my_table` we get this query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE my_table AS\r\nSELECT 1 AS col;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for a query with multiple statements we run CTAS **for each one**. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT 1 AS col;\r\nSELECT 2 AS col;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run with CTAS and `my_table` will produce these 2 queries:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE my_table AS\r\nSELECT 1 AS col;\r\nCREATE TABLE my_table AS\r\nSELECT 2 AS col;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first query runs successfully, but the second fails because the table already exists.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the CTAS behavior, making it more consistent with how multiple statements work in SQL Lab. It changes SQL Lab so that:\r\n\r\n1. A CTAS query can have multiple statements, as long as the last one is a `SELECT`. This allows user to pre-process the data before loading it into the table. A simple example in MySQL would be:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSET @value = 42;\r\nSELECT @value AS foo;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run in a CTAS, this will create a table with the column `foo` with a row with the value 42,  as expected.\r\n\r\nIn Hive, a common pattern is to write queries like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE staging_table ...;\r\nSELECT * FROM staging_table WHERE ...;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich should also work.\r\n\r\n2. A CVAS (create view as select) query, on the other hand, can have a single statement and it MUST be a `SELECT`. Before, there was no differentiation between CTAS and CVAS (other than the query generated).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSQL Lab height is currently broken, fixed at 500px because in `SqlLab/main.less` we set:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n  min-height: 500px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverriding the default value of:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* superset-frontend/stylesheets/less/index.less */\r\nbody {\r\n  min-height: 100vh;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want the minimum width to be `100vh`, so that SQL Lab takes the whole screen, but we also want it to be at least 500px tall so that the resize handle appears (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8716). So this PR sets it to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n  min-height: ~\"max(100vh, 500px)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Less doesn't like the use of `max` with different units, raising \"error evaluating function `max`: incompatible types\", so I had to [escape the expression](https://github.com/SomMeri/less4j/wiki/Less-Language-Escaping).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---
