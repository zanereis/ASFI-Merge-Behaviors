\r\n\r\nI went ahead and added getUniqueId to both DistributedMember and NetMember because the returned value should be the same as getId but without the membership port that was being changed in NetMember. If there is a better name for getUniqueId, please make suggestions!\r\n\r\nI also renamed MBeanJMXAdapter.getMemberNameOrId to MBeanJMXAdapter.getMemberNameOrUniqueId and added new tests to MBeanJMXAdapterTest for my changes.\r\n\r\nPR #3071 has failing tests caused by the MBean names changing in Loners because of getId mutating at runtime.

This moves the classes under `org.apache.geode.cache.configuration` classes into a public module: `geode-managament-api`. The intent is that this module will have no dependencies to `geode-core` but will allow consumers to perform administration tasks (creating regions, etc.).\r\n- `geode-core` will now depend on both `geode-management-api` as well as `geode-common` (transitively). Suggestions on how to improve these new dependencies are welcome.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Peter Tran <ptran@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

external APIs have been added. They are all marked with \"since Geode 1.9\".\r\nYou can now create a PdxInstance that will never deserialize to a domain class.\r\nInstead it will remain a PdxInstance. The apis call these \"stable\" pdx instances.\r\n\r\nThe JDBC connection now uses these stable pdx instances instead of json strings for keys that represent multiple columns.\r\n\r\nSome internal classes were directly accessing methods on PdxInstanceImpl. \r\nThose have been changed to use the InternalPdxInstance interface instead.\r\nOne method, used by the query system, was on PdxInstanceImpl but did not\r\nuse any of its state. So this method is now in the query system instead of PdxInstanceImpl.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @gesterzhou \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\nThis removes use of

The second commit\r\nfixes the problems in that commit.  If you've already reviewed the old\r\ncode you can probably just look at the second commit.\r\n\r\n- position tracking for MsgReader has been moved into NioSslEngine and\r\nNioPlainEngine because the Ssl engine sometimes needs to allocate a new\r\nbuffer and adjust the tracked read/process positions in the buffer\r\n\r\n- the same buffer expansion methods in Buffers was being used for\r\nread-side and write-side buffers but buffers being used for reads need\r\nto be handled differently than buffers being used for writing\r\n\r\nThere is commented-out debugging code that I'll remove when these\r\nchanges pass the Pull Request Stress Tests.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

commit f4b0643829b00d0ba9b0852fdd3a679812395545 introduced deadlock between concurrent updates with custom expiry which invoked getValue() from the region entry.\r\n\r\nIn this case the basicPut() was taking the regionEntry lock and calling customExpiry() which gets the regionEntry from the LRU list which could have been locked by another thread, calling getValue() on this regionEntry invokes lruUpdateCallback() which tries to acquire a lock, resulting in dead lock. \r\n\r\nThe issue was fixed by making sure lruUpdateCallback is deferred/called at the higher/caller level (before synchronizing region entry).\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps

removes old-I/O use in TCPConduit peer-to-peer communications. \r\nThis was used for SSL/TLS secure commuications but Java has had an \r\nSSLEngine implementation that allows you to implement secure \r\ncommunications on new-I/O SocketChannels or any other transport mechanism.\r\n\r\nA new NioSSLEngine class wraps the JDK's SSLEngine and provides the\r\nSSL handshake as well as encryption/decryption of messages. SocketCreator\r\nperforms the SSL handshake and returns a NioSslEngine that TCPConduit \r\nthen uses for messaging.\r\n\r\nThe SSL handshake needs to be done in Connection.java now because the \r\nByteBuffer used to do the handshake is also used for reading messages\r\nin Receivers. Because of this the Handshake pool in TCPConduit became \r\nobsolete and I deleted it.\r\n\r\nI've also done a lot of cleanup of compilation warnings in Connection.java\r\nand removed references to \"NIO\". The primary SSL/TLS changes in that class\r\nare in writeFully (renamed from nioWriteFully) and processBuffer (renamed\r\nfrom processNIOBuffer).\r\n\r\nWhile testing I noticed some places where we're creating non-daemon\r\nthreads that were keeping DUnit ChildVM processes from exiting.  I've\r\nchanged these places to use daemon threads.  Very few threads in Geode\r\nshould be non-daemon.\r\n\r\nPorting client/server to use NioSSLEngine will be done under a separate \r\nticket and a different version of NioEngine may be created to secure UDP\r\nmessaging.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nThis removes old-I/O use in TCPConduit peer-to-peer communications. \r\nThis was used for SSL/TLS secure commuications but Java has had an \r\nSSLEngine implementation that allows you to implement secure \r\ncommunications on new-I/O SocketChannels or any other transport  mechanism.\r\n\r\nA new NioSSLEngine class wraps the JDK's SSLEngine and provides the\r\nSSL handshake as well as encryption/decryption of messages. SocketCreator\r\nperforms the SSL handshake and returns a NioSslEngine that TCPConduit \r\nthen uses for messaging.\r\n\r\nThe SSL handshake needs to be done in Connection.java now because the \r\nByteBuffer used to do the handshake is also used for reading messages\r\nin  Receivers. Because of this the Handshake pool in TCPConduit became \r\nobsolete and I deleted it.\r\n\r\nI've also done a lot of cleanup of compilation warnings in  Connection.java\r\nand removed references to \"NIO\". The primary SSL/TLS changes in that class\r\nare in writeFully (renamed from nioWriteFully) and processBuffer (renamed\r\nfrom processNIOBuffer).\r\n\r\nWhile testing I noticed some places where we're creating non-daemon\r\nthreads that were keeping DUnit ChildVM processes from exiting.  I've\r\nchanged these places to use daemon threads.  Very few threads in Geode\r\nshould be non-daemon.\r\n\r\nPorting client/server to use NioSSLEngine will be done under a separate \r\nticket and a different version of NioEngine may be created to secure UDP\r\nmessaging.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

on the dev-list back in March was to remove VALIDATE_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECTS from default configuration of dunit, so I've gone ahead and removed it in this PR.\r\n\r\nAfter removing VALIDATE_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECTS, the only dunit tests that failed were the two subclasses of QueryCommandDUnitTestBase. Since that test actually includes a test to explicitly verify SERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_FILTER, I changed the test itself to enable VALIDATE_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECTS. That's the 2nd commit in this PR.\r\n\r\nMany tests still set SERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_FILTER which is harmless (they still pass), and I'd like to remove those as a follow-up to this PR (since it'll be a very large diff). As I remove it from each test, I'd like to take a closer look to see if any of those tests would be appropriate ones to add in a new test specific to enabling VALIDATE_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECTS like I've done in QueryCommandDUnitTestBase.","created_at":"2018-12-19T21:57:47Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T21:00:35Z","closed_at":"2018-12-22T00:00:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfaad901a387dcabe1fd3670f6d731901a68943c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/ddd4ce2eec64b5fd99e857a05b9ccd5d905636e3","head":{"label":"kirklund:GEODE-6202-dunit-remove-VALIDATE_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECTS","ref":"GEODE-6202-dunit-remove-VALIDATE_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECTS","sha":"ddd4ce2eec64b5fd99e857a05b9ccd5d905636e3","user":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58218609,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODIxODYwOQ==","name":"geode","full_name":"kirklund/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund/geode","description":"Mirror

to different handling in the GatewaySenderEventRemoteDispatcher\r\ndispatcher and ack reader threads, it was possible for event processing\r\nto stop when a GemFireSecurityException was encountered by the ack\r\nreader connection retry logic.\r\n\r\nThis commit attempts to share common recoverable cases between the ack\r\nreader and dispatcher, while maintaining the cases which are specific to\r\neach.  We also added a test which ensures that if a connection is denied\r\ndue to invalid credentials upon a restart of the receiver, that the\r\nsender can recover if it again provides valid credentials.

to different handling in the GatewaySenderEventRemoteDispatcher\r\ndispatcher and ack reader threads, it was possible for event processing\r\nto stop when a GemFireSecurityException was encountered by the ack\r\nreader connection retry logic.\r\n\r\nThis commit attempts to share common recoverable cases between the ack\r\nreader and dispatcher, while maintaining the cases which are specific to\r\neach.  We also added a test which ensures that if a connection is denied\r\ndue to invalid credentials upon a restart of the receiver, that the\r\nsender can recover if it again provides valid credentials.
