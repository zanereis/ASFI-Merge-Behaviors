(Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [ ] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@jasonkuster this is essentially an inlining of the configuration for batch. Notes:\r\n\r\n - I'd love to just provide `-D beamTestPipelineOptions=...` and have things automatically just add `--streaming=true` and `--streaming=false` but don't know that you can do that effectively in a POM.\r\n - Setting `parallel=all` and `threadCount=4` I did manage to get a 429, which surprised me. TBD why that happens; something is not blocking when it should and/or leaking jobs.\r\n\r\nCC @davorbonaci in case you have any vision for the right way for this config to get into the
