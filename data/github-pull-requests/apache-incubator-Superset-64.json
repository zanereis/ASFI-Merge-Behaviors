bump PyArrow (from 5.0.0 to 6.0.1)\r\nAlso bump Pandas to latest minor (from 1.3.4 to 1.4.3).\r\n\r\nPandas 1.4 added a wheel for Python 3.9, Apple Silicon\r\n\r\nPandas 1.4 introduced support for using pyarrow as an engine for reading CSVs, which brings performance improvements (see https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.4.0.html#multi-threaded-csv-reading-with-a-new-csv-engine-based-on-pyarrow for details).

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a method called `get_metrics` to the `Database` model and the base DB engine spec. It allows DB engine specs to return custom metrics for a given dataset, so that when a user adds a new dataset it can have more metrics than just `COUNT(*)` (the  current behavior).\r\n\r\nCurrently no DB engine spec implements `get_metrics`, but in the future it could be leveraged by DB engine specs that have a semantic layer (like https://cube.dev/).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

The old organization has <em>many</em> approved owners and thus a new repository could (in theory) be created at the old URL, circumventing Github's automatic redirect that is in place now and serving malicious code. I (<a href=\"https://github.com/qix\"><code>@​qix</code></a>-) also wouldn't have access to that repository, so while I don't think it would happen, it's still something to consider.</p>\n<p>Even in such a case, however, the officially released package on npm (<code>debug</code>) would <em>not</em> be affected. That package is still very much under control (even more than it used to be).</p>\n<h3>Q: What should I do if I encounter an issue related to the migration?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/debug-js/debug/issues?q=label%3Amigration+\">Search the issues first</a> to see if someone has already reported it, and <em>then</em> open a new issue if someone has not.</p>\n<h3>Q: Why was this done as a 'patch' release? Isn't this breaking?</h3>\n<p>No, it shouldn't be breaking. The package on npm shouldn't be affected (aside from this patch release) and any references to the old repository should automatically redirect.</p>\n<p>Thus, according to all of the &quot;APIs&quot; (loosely put) involved, nothing should have broken.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the access checks are happening 2ce in the explore flow, once during the object lookup and later doing an explicit check.  Existing implementation was spending  > 500 ms in our deployment on doing object by id lookup and that contributed to ~1 - 1.5 second slowdown of the explore endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution skips the filter on the chart / datasource lookup and let's explore to handle the access checks and return 403 if it was denied. Prior behavior was to return 404.\r\n\r\n#### Out of scope\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f0ca158989644b793719884b52d04f93c05de1ba/superset/views/utils.py#L104 function takes > 1 second in our deployment, it is part of the explore flow while bootsrapping user data https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/f0ca158989644b793719884b52d04f93c05de1ba/superset/views/utils.py#L72  I will have

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user opens Explore and then immediately navigates back, some unexpected URL replacements happen because of logic in Explore which asynchronously replaces URL search params when form_data_key request is completed. This PR fixes that behaviour by ensuring that current page is Explore before replacing the URL\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore (I navigated back with my touchpad right after opening Explore, remained in Explore anyways and then navigating back didn't take me back to the dashboard):\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/182869927-30a25e7d-b94c-494a-acde-5a09ab512e07.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/182869865-a0b65f47-d9a2-472d-b921-90056481789e.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open dashboard and then click \"Edit chart\"\r\n2. Navigate back immediately after Explore opens\r\n3. Verify that navigation worked as expected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFix a bug in BigQuery probably introduced with the upgrade to SQLAlchemy 1.4. When building a URL with `make_url`, the `query` attribute is now an `immutabledict`, which fails to be serialized to JSON. I fixed the `get_parameters_from_uri` method in the BigQuery DB engine spec by explicitly converting it into a dictionary.\r\n\r\nI also checked for other places where this could happen, but couldn't find any other place where we return the `query` attribute to be serialized to JSON.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests and confirmed that I was able to (1) add a BigQuery database (this was failing) and edit it later (also failing).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nSometimes when user entered Explore from Dashboard, Explore was scrolled down and user was stuck in that position. That's because Explore is sometimes mounted with initial scroll set to some value above 0. We are stuck in this position, because of `overflow: hidden` on body. It’s related to how react-router mounts components on navigation, but I haven’t been able to find an answer why this bug is so non-deterministic.\r\nWe fix it by programmatically scrolling to top when SPA route pathname changes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe bug shown in the video shows up only from time to time. After this fix, Explore should always open normally.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/182681101-02d03f7e-6fd3-4f7f-b7f6-270d16410580.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard\r\n2. Scroll down and open some chart in Explore.\r\n3. Go back to dashboard and repeat step 2.\r\n4. Repeat step 3 multiple times. Bug occurs very randomly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis creates the basic reducer hook for the Dataset Creation screen that is currently in process of being implemented. \r\n\r\nMore actions will be added, but this should be considered the skeleton of the reducer. \r\n\r\nMost important to note is the hierarchical nature of the selection actions, database selection should flush tables and schemas, schema selection should do tables, etc. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, when user changes datasource in Explore, we try to keep controls that use columns available in the new datasource, but we always discard adhoc columns/metrics/filters that use custom SQL. This PR changes that behaviour by always keeping the controls with custom sql, but with added warning icon. We can't reliably verify if controls with custom SQL are compatible with the new datasource, so we let the user decide (since it's quicker to remove a control than to create it from scratch). If user runs a successful query, the warning icons disappear.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/182167215-e3606801-5ec9-4b3e-b7f7-fec893fea6b0.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add some controls with custom sql\r\n2. Switch to a different datasource\r\n3. Verify that the controls with custom sql now have a warning icon with a tooltip\r\n4. If the next query is successful, the warning icons should disappear. Otherwise, they should still be displayed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a custom date field value converted in a string format, some aggregators truncated to the first four digits.\r\nThis is caused by the parseFloat function which converts to first

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a browser confirmation modal (similar to the one that we have in dashboard edit mode) when user makes a change in control panel and then tries to close Explore (either by closing the tab or moving to another page) without clicking Save button.\r\nThe modal that displays when user navigates out of SPA context (some external page or a Superset page that hasn't been migrated to SPA yet) or closes the tab, is not customizable.\r\nIn the case of navigating within SPA context, we can easily display a custom message in the modal thanks to react-router's `Prompt` component. However, displaying a custom modal instead of the default one rendered by `<Prompt />` requires more effort and will be handled in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nCC @kasiazjc \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/188621562-23b4e1cf-32e7-440a-9b03-ae90cdf398d4.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a chart and make some changes in control panel\r\n2. Try to go to another SPA page (like charts list)\r\n3. A modal should appear. Clicking Leave should discard your changes and go to next page. Clicking Cancel should close the modal.\r\n4. Make some changes in control panel and try to close browser tab or go to some external page.\r\n5. A default browser confirmation modal should appear (it's not customizable)\r\n6. Save your changes\r\n7. Now leaving the page should not trigger the confirmation modal\r\n\r\nKNOWN LIMITATION: if the previous page is a SPA route (for example you opened Explore from charts list), clicking browser back button will not trigger the confirmation modal. It's very bugged in react-router and I decided to disable it for now. We'll try to find a workaround in the future\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nSuperset can be configured to use an external store for database passwords. This is useful if you a running a custom secret distribution framework and do not wish to store secrets in Superset’s meta database.\r\nThis useful capability can be extended by providing  Superset’s meta database as a fallback in the case the administration doesn't want to use an external store for a particular database \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nSet `SQLALCHEMY_CUSTOM_PASSWORD_STORE`   to point to an external lookup function. and the user does not have to check where her password is saved. Current tests must continue to work\r\n\r\n ### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

Lab performance regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/11785—a mere two years ago—which impacts the populating the tables in the SQL Lab LHS.\r\n\r\nSpecially at Airbnb for the Presto database the following line \r\n\r\n```\r\ndataset_tables = {table.name: table for table in database.tables} \r\n```\r\n\r\nwould take over 5 seconds to execute given we have over 100,000 tables registered with said database in Superset. The fix is to bypass the SQLAlchemy ORM and fetch only the subset of relevant tables using the SQLAlchemy Query API. The resulting refactor reduced the statement execution time down to << 0.01 seconds.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn the current version of the master branch, the back-end only supports tagging for 'Charts', 'Dashboards' and 'Saved Queries'. However, this PR would add the back-end support for tagging 'Datasets' as well. This is just the first of at least 2 PR's, the second of which will introduce new API endpoints as well as add dataset tags to the front-end.\r\n\r\nThis PR also incorporates a few changes to files for refactoring purposes:\r\n\r\n1. The model for tags was moved from `superset/models/tags.py` to `superset/tags/models.py` (all of the import statements have been updated to point to the new location). This was done so that going forward, the model will be in the same location as the API and command code, which will be added later on.\r\n2. The SQLAlchemy event listeners for adding, updating, and removing tags have been removed from each model, and were instead placed into a singular location: `superset/tags/core.py`. The event listeners are now registered from within the `init_app_in_ctx` method in the `superset/initialization/__init__.py` file, and are placed behind a check for the `TAGGING_SYSTEM` feature flag. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If you are not starting from a 'fresh' database, be sure to run the following command: `superset sync_tags`. This will add tags to all of the existing datasets.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTo manually verify the changes, first connect to the local database, then run the following:\r\n\r\n**Before Code Changes:**\r\n1. `SELECT * FROM tag;` (you should not see a dataset entry)\r\n4. `SELECT * FROM tagged_object;` (you should not see any entry with the dataset tag/type)\r\n\r\n**After Code Changes:**\r\n1. `SELECT * FROM tag;` (you should now see a dataset entry)\r\n2. `SELECT * FROM tagged_object;` (you should now see some entries with the dataset tag/type)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [X] Required feature flags: TAGGING_SYSTEM\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nAdds drill to detail (drill-through) context menu for ECharts visualizations. The context menu is triggered when right-clicking an EChart series. Upon selecting a drill to detail option, an alert is displayed with the selected values.\r\n\r\nThe linking between the context menu and the actual feature will be handled in a future PR.\r\n\r\nThe context menu was added to all ECharts with the exception of the Tree Chart.\r\n\r\nThe feature is behind the `DRILL_TO_DETAIL` feature flag.\r\n\r\nThis first iteration focuses on providing a minimal set of interaction possibilities for the ECharts. More advanced interactions like clicking on legends, subheaders, etc will be handled in follow-up PRs. Drilling to detail using metrics is not supported as well.\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc @lauderbaugh @rusackas @codyml \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/181340086-a6a8376f-e962-440c-b5f4-8679bc731337.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1 - Make sure the feature does not introduce any regression when disabled. This is the default value for the feature flag.\r\n\r\n2 - Enable the `DRILL_TO_DETAIL` feature flag and check:\r\n- Check if there are no regressions when right-clicking the series for different charts\r\n- Check if the right-click works with different chart control values (dimensions, time grain, customizations, etc)\r\n- Check if the correct values are displayed in the context menu\r\n- Check if the correct values are displayed when selecting a context menu option\r\n- Check if other dashboard interactions are not affected by the new feature such as cross-filtering, drag-and-drop, tooltips, etc\r\n\r\nBelow is the import file for the dashboard shown in the video:\r\n[dashboard_export_20220727T144027.zip](https://github.com/apache/superset/files/9202425/dashboard_export_20220727T144027.zip)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Required feature flags: `DRILL_TO_DETAIL`\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-27T18:16:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:22:52Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T20:02:31Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T20:02:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"3df8335f8792c85d7e2f7fefa5dd60fb2c0befaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"stephenLYZ","id":11830681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODMwNjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11830681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/stephenLYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenLYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kgabryje","id":15073128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDczMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15073128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje","html_url":"https://github.com/kgabryje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329338104,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MzM4MTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XL","name":"size/XL","color":"5C3BBc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2981966197,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTgxOTY2MTk3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/need:qa-review","name":"need:qa-review","color":"fff3b1","default":false,"description":"Requires

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements SPA navigation in Datasets list. By default, clicking on dataset's name opens Explore, but user can override it with some external URL. Default react-router Link component can't handle external URLs, so I implemented a `GenericLink` component, which check if URL is external - if it does, use HTML anchor element, else use react-router Link.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/181757636-957f38fb-9640-4c9f-a21e-19dc2763cd8a.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open datasets list\r\n2. Click dataset's name, verify that Explore opens\r\n3. Go back to datasets list, click \"Edit\" -> tab \"Settings\" -> set some external URL in \"Default URL\" field (like \"https://google.com\" or whatever) -> Save\r\n4. Click dataset's name, verify that external URL opens\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nWe want to configure a different replicaCount for `supersetNode` and `supersetWorker` deployments, as they do not undergo the same load.\r\n\r\nThe `replicaCount` should be configurable on a per component level instead of globally for the whole chart.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTemplating can be verified manually with `helm template`\r\n- `helm lint`\r\n- `helm3 template superset-release .`\r\n- Check that the new values are now required\r\n```\r\n❯ helm template superset-release .  --set supersetWorker.replicaCount=null --set supersetNode.replicaCount=null\r\n\r\nError: values don't meet the specifications of the schema(s) in the following chart(s):\r\nsuperset:\r\n- supersetWorker: replicaCount is required\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nThe `having_druid` key still exists in some query table extras json blobs in the database. We removed the key from the chart schema in the native druid cleanup work https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20338 but need to run a migration in order to remove the key permanently from query objects in the database. This PR is a temporary fix to add the property back into the schema for an easier cherry prior to the db migration. We need to remove this property again and run the migration together next. \r\n\r\nThe error that we're seeing is on some reports that still have the old key`{\"message\":\"Request is incorrect: {'queries': {0: {'extras': {'having_druid': ['Unknown field.']}}}}\"}`\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nI added `having_druid` to an existing test and validated that it failed and then fixed the code and validated that it passed. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe main rendering in SqlLab is managed by the `queryEditors` state from redux(state machine).\r\nEach queryEditor state has been updated whenever an editor configuration has updated.\r\n\r\nSince most components observes entire queryEditor state not specific attributes, any queryEditor updates trigger multiple repainting even if no visual changes impacted.\r\n\r\nFor example, when a user types any single character in the ace(sql) editor, it triggers the update for `selectedText` value in the active queryEditor state. This single change will trigger the following components repainted (though this change won't impact the left and bottom panels at all)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1057\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-07-26_at_3_10_16_PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/181122038-84caef40-9f52-4bdd-83c6-1d473a7c011c.png\">\r\n\r\nThis unrelated repainting job causes the performance delay especially when table list is humongous.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1055\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-07-26_at_3_24_05_PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/181122746-8f5b4ae4-6d04-4c25-8289-bbde0e668bc3.png\">\r\n\r\nThe delay can be found in the following performance analysis due to the unnecessary repainting/redux post processes.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1786\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-07-25_at_4_08_35_PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/181123341-7d082ac9-302d-4a32-8219-bade95846908.png\">\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this performance issue by optimizing observers in each component to subscribe only related items.\r\nTo minimize the regression issue from existing persistence state, this commit keeps the existing `queryEditors` state but make it immutable during the tab is active and only updates when the tab is switched. It introduces `unsavedQueryEditor` state which stores all these active changes.\r\n\r\nWith this update, the page rendering performance improved 3.5x faster(from 4.5s to 1.3s) and verified all unnecessary tasks cleaned.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1816\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-25 at 4 18 45 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/181124253-e9d4e4d7-5ea6-4c60-b328-4786277e8583.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore (4.5s):\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/181118443-f8949bc1-1d07-4dcb-8a65-aec1ff024fee.mov\r\n\r\nAfter (1.3s):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1814\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-07-25_at_4_19_14_PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1392866/181118409-b876d22d-2402-4a1f-9634-4e99c1473ca3.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

Change CPU throttling to 6x slowdown\r\n6. type a string in the sql editor and then watch the refresh icon on the left panel (it will blink during repainting)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis work was done by [@cccs-nik](https://github.com/cccs-nik) on our own fork of superset. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there exists tagging for dashboards, charts, and saved queries in the backend. This PR introduces Tagging to the front-end and allows users to view and edit tags in the UI. Feedback is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nThe following are some features introduced:\r\n- Tags can be seen and are searchable in the list view for dashboards, charts and saved queries. Tags can be added via the \"edit properties\" modal for dashboards and charts, but there is currently no way to add tags to saved queries. \r\n- Clicking on a tag will take the user to a new page that displays all objects with that tag. \r\n- Tags are automatically applied to all objects that contain the type of an object and the owner of the object, but only \"custom\" type tags are displayed in the UI. \r\n\r\nThe future work for this will be to add tags for saved queries somewhere in the UI and to add tagging for datasets to both the frontend and the backend. \r\nNOTE: currently working on adding some integration tests for the tags api changes and they will shortly be added\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nSome examples for tagging dashboards\r\nDashboard List\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/181097087-3ebe4aec-8ee9-402b-a2d2-09dc40d6cf2f.png)\r\nDashboard Header\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/181097165-1933dc13-eef0-416d-bafe-c4c41a36e6fd.png)\r\nEdit Properties for Dashboard\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/181102156-40d4fff4-357b-4aa7-be22-55660dcaa8cd.png)\r\nTags View (endpoint: /superset/tags/?tags=[tag_name])\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/181097975-794c606d-e0e5-42f5-87d0-9e6b36719832.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Set feature flag TAGGING_SYSTEM to true in superset/config.py\r\n- navigate to the edit properties modal for either charts or dashboards to add tags\r\n- view tags from the lists or headers for dashboards or charts. \r\n- click on tags or navigate to the 'Tags' tab to search objects by tags.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

EMAIL_REPORTS_SUBJECT_PREFIX var.\r\n- Rearrange for clarity.\r\n- Copyedit, e.g., \"relative\" -> \"relevant\" and consistency of spacing and capitalization.\r\n- Note that dev image has browser and geckodriver but non-dev does not.\r\n- Remove some duplicative content not specific to Alerts and Reports\r\n  - A whole `docker-compose.yml` is not necessary when there's a newer one already in the repo\r\n  - No need to introduce Redis, Postgres components\r\n  - The pieces of this bottom deleted block that remained possibly relevant (description of Celery beat and worker, mention of docker swarm) were moved elsewhere\r\n\r\nI can edit to retain add'l info or reword, etc. - just let me know what to change or push changes directly to my branch.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe Standardized Form Data is an ephemeral state keeper for keeping `form_data` between different viz. it
