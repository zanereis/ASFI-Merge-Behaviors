Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe thread context saves some info about a working thread.\r\n1. thread_id:   Current thread id, Auto generated.\r\n2. type:           The type is a enum value indicating which type of task current thread is running.\r\n                        For example: QUERY, LOAD, COMPACTION, ...\r\n3. task id:       A unique id to identify this task. maybe query id, load job id, etc.\r\n\r\nUsing gcc11 compiles thread_local variable on lower versions of GLIBC will report an error, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/pull/7911\r\nThis is very difficult to solve, so kudu Class-scoped static thread local implementation was introduced. Solve the above problem by Thread-scopedthread local + Class-scoped thread local. See the comments for ThreadContextPtr for details.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #7196) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-28T13:39:37Z","updated_at":"2022-03-14T06:32:32Z","closed_at":"2022-03-10T01:05:40Z","merged_at":"2022-03-10T01:05:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"8eec4bf99d587b297278959c659245913fea8818","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe previous DataSourceFunction inherited from RichSourceFunction. As a result, no matter how much the parallelism of flink is set, the parallelism of DataSourceFunction is only 1.\r\nNow modify it to **RichParallelSourceFunction**.\r\n\r\nAnd when flink has multiple degrees of parallelism, assign the doris data to each parallelism.\r\nFor example, read dorisPartitions.size = 10, flink.parallelism = 4\r\nThe task is split as follows:\r\ntask0: dorisPartitions[0],[4],[8]\r\ntask1: dorisPartitions[1],[5],[9]\r\ntask2: dorisPartitions[2],[6]\r\ntask3: dorisPartitions[3],[7]\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [x] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-26T17:14:42Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T08:21:30Z","closed_at":"2021-12-15T08:21:29Z","merged_at":"2021-12-15T08:21:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"549e84940091e306b6be59665bcaa746e2197caa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`select bitmap_xor(bitmap_from_string('1'), bitmap_from_string('1,1'));`\r\n\r\n`https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap`\r\n```\r\nThe btree containers are direct ports from Abseil, and should behave exactly the same as the Abseil ones, modulo small differences (such as supporting std::string_view instead of absl::string_view, and being forward declarable).\r\n\r\nWhen btrees are mutated, values stored within can be moved in memory. This means that pointers or iterators to values stored in btree containers can be invalidated when that btree is modified. This is a significant difference with std::map and std::set, as the std containers do offer a guarantee of pointer stability. The same is true for the 'flat' hash maps and sets.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [X] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [X] I have created an issue on (Fix #7218) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-25T09:07:13Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T06:45:33Z","closed_at":"2021-11-25T14:52:51Z","merged_at":"2021-11-25T14:52:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"2445f108685588e8a354c7c41d9030750c070c21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Add thread local variable TheadContext, save task info, MemTracker, etc.;\r\n2. Implement a new memory statistics framework based on TCMalloc Hook and TheadContext, and it is expected that all memory consume/release of the BE process can be counted; (Introduction: https://shimo.im/docs/DT6JXDRkdTvdyV3G)\r\n3. Refactor MemTracker, streamline the code, and adapt to the new statistical framework;\r\n4. Add Task MemTracker Pool, manage all Query, Load, and Compaction tasks on BE, a Task ID is unique in the BE process, and judge whether it exceeds the Query memory limit based on the sum of the memory consumption of all fragments of a Task.\r\n(Unlike before, The query memory limit was previously used as a fragment instance level limit. Therefore, some previously successful large queries may fail, and the query memory limit configuration needs to be increased.)\r\n5. Add new Process MemTracker, ChunkAllocator MemTracker, and modify the memory statistics method of MemPool and BufferPool.\r\n\r\n[ impact of testing on performance ]\r\nThe current default untracked_mem_limit_mbytes = 1M, the test found no impact on performance\r\nConfig `untracked_mem_limit_mbytes` impact on performance:\r\nmaster, jmeter thread=50, Avg1: 23120, Avg2: 22505, Avg3: 23459\r\nuntracked_mem_limit_mbytes=4M, jmeter thread=50, Avg1: 23024, Avg2: 23391 22681\r\nuntracked_mem_limit_mbytes=2M, jmeter thread=50, Avg1: 23426, Avg2: 22674 23658\r\nuntracked_mem_limit_mbytes=64K, jmeter thread=50, Avg1: 24121, Avg2: 24042 23762 22939 23294\r\nuntracked_mem_limit_mbytes=4K, jmeter thread=50, Avg1: 24942, Avg2: 24983 23305 22611 23506\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #7196) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen predicates contains invalid date should be throw exception, MYSQL database is like this.\r\n\r\ncases are as follows:\r\ncreate table t3 (tc1 datetime,tc2

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe broker scan node has two tuple descriptors:\r\nOne is dest tuple and the other is src tuple.\r\nThe src tuple is used to read the lines of the original file,\r\n\r\nand the dest tuple is used to save the converted lines.\r\nThe preceding filter is executed on the src tuple, so src tuple descriptor should be used\r\nto initialize the filter expression\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #7192 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-23T06:41:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T14:04:06Z","closed_at":"2021-11-30T14:04:06Z","merged_at":"2021-11-30T14:04:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c4aeab06f3c84f387c523758a8145c7a6ecf970","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWe found that many commit messages submitted at present have ambiguous information. Clear commit messages can help developers submit pull requests more readable, committers merge easilerly and Release Manager easy to release. Therefore, we have sorted out a version of the commit format specification. We hope that subsequent contributors can sort out the commit messages according to the specification when submitting Pull Request.\r\n\r\n我们发现当前提交的很多Commit Message存在信息模糊的情况，清晰的Commit Message可以帮助开发者提交的Pull Request更加易读，便于Committer合入，也便于Release Manager进行发版。因此我们整理了一版Commit格式规范，希望后续Contributor在提交PR时可以按照规范整理Commit Message。\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWe found that many commit messages submitted at present have ambiguous information. Clear commit messages can help developers submit pull requests more readable, committers merge easilerly and Release Manager easy to release. Therefore, we have sorted out a version of the commit format specification. We hope that subsequent contributors can sort out the commit messages according to the specification when submitting Pull Request.\r\n\r\n我们发现当前提交的很多Commit Message存在信息模糊的情况，清晰的Commit Message可以帮助开发者提交的Pull Request更加易读，便于Committer合入，也便于Release Manager进行发版。因此我们整理了一版Commit格式规范，希望后续Contributor在提交PR时可以按照规范整理Commit Message。\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWe found that many commit messages submitted at present have ambiguous information. Clear commit messages can help developers submit pull requests more readable, committers merge easilerly and Release Manager easy to release. Therefore, we have sorted out a version of the commit format specification. We hope that subsequent contributors can sort out the commit messages according to the specification when submitting Pull Request.\r\n\r\n我们发现当前提交的很多Commit Message存在信息模糊的情况，清晰的Commit Message可以帮助开发者提交的Pull Request更加易读，便于Committer合入，也便于Release Manager进行发版。因此我们整理了一版Commit格式规范，希望后续Contributor在提交PR时可以按照规范整理Commit Message。\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIf the calculation of the lateral view function is completed,\r\nthe result will be directly returned to the upper layer.\r\nIt will cause a lot of memory copy and network transmission.\r\nThe reason is that the original column that generally participates\r\nin the lateral view is very likely to be a very long value.\r\nIf Doris still retain this column after calculating the lateral view,\r\nit need to perform a memory copy.\r\nHowever, in many cases, the upper plan node does not need the original columns of the lateral view,\r\nso it is necessary to perform column pruning after the calculation of the lateral view,\r\nso as to avoid useless memory copy and network transmission.\r\nFor example, the following query can prune the original column v1\r\n```select k1, e1 from table lateral view explode_split(v1, \",\") tmp as e1;```\r\n\r\nThe `outputSlotIds` in TableFunctionNode is used to store the columns that should be retained after pruning.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an

删除无用的成员变量\r\n2. 添加const修饰，作为只读函数\r\n3. 删除空的析构函数，编译器会自动生成，参考3/5/0法则：[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three)\r\n4. 建议子类虚函数添加override关键字（而不用virtual关键字），override会让编译器帮助检查，提高安全性，这也是C++11引入override原因\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org
