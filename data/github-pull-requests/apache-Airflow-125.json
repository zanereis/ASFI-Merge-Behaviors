integration tests fail with not being able to allocate ports in Public GitHub runners. It seems to be more problematic in Postgres/MySQL/MsSQL jobs where resource requirements are far bigger than in SQLite jobs. And in most PRs success in SQLite means that the tests will also pass on other backends.\r\n\r\nWe still have the safety net of \"Canary\" builds where complete set of tests is run so this should be safe to skip integration tests where public runners are infolved on non-sqlite backends.\r\n\r\nThis should significantly decrease number of false-negatives that non-commiters get in their PRs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The \"I'm determined to fix SLAs\" PR\r\n\r\n(Look familiar? This was originally opened as #25489, but at some point during a rebase, the PR got closed, and I couldn't persuade github that I really did have some commits in the branch...)\r\n\r\nOK, so #25147 made a start in this direction. Summing up the, er, summary from _that_ MR, the problem was that SLA callbacks could keep occuring, and prevent the dag processor manager from ever processing more than 2 or 3 dags in the queue before the SLA callbacks re-upped and went to the front of the queue.\r\n\r\nUnder the new behaviour, the SLA callbacks went to the _back_ of the queue. This guaranteed that the queue would be processed at least once. However, it turns out that dags on disk would only be re-added to the queue _once the queue was empty_. But with SLA callbacks arriving All. The. Time. the queue would never drain, and we'd never re-read dags from disk. So if you updated the dag file, you'd have to bounce the scheduler to pick up the change, and then it would process all non-SLA-generating DAGs exactly once. And then you'd need to bounce again.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #15596 (I hope!)\r\n\r\n# I've almost certainly missed some steps.\r\n\r\nBefore I go into a bit more detail about the change, I'd like to acknowledge that as a (very) small time contributor to the project, I'm not familiar with all the done things when making more radical changes. In particular, I assume there's more doc changes needed than just a newsfragment. I've added a config flag, some metrics, _and_ the behaviour of the queue processing has subtly changed (for the better I hope!)\r\n\r\nI'd very much appreciate someone(s) leaving a comment :point_down: telling me what else I need to do in terms of docs etc.\r\n\r\n# TL;DR\r\n\r\nI mean, I see your point. Skip to the bottom for the summary.\r\n\r\n# Pay attention, here comes the science bit\r\n\r\nOk, so to briefly recap the queue behaviour prior to this change:\r\n1. The scheduler spins up.\r\n2. The worker loop starts.\r\n3. It scans the disk to create a list of all known files. _It does not add these files to the queue_.\r\n4. If the queue is empty (on start up it will be) then all known files are added to the queue.\r\n5. It then spins up dag processors (via multiprocessing or in-line, depending on set up) to consume the first N entries in the queue (where N is a function of config settings, and includes a count of any files currently being processed from a previous pass of the loop)\r\n6. It then goes back to step 2.\r\n\r\n- Note that Step 3 is re-run periodically based on a time interval set in config (`dag_dir_list_interval`). It does not require that the queue be empty. Any changes to the set of files on disk e.g. dags being deleted will cause the manager to remove dags from the queue.\r\n- After a few iterations of the loop, the contents of the queue are processed, and step 4 kicks in, and the dag files present on disk are re-added to the queue again.\r\n    - The default config is to do this no more than once every 30 seconds (`min_file_process_interval`), so if your dag files only take 10 seconds to process, there will be 20 seconds of idle time, but if your dag files take a minute to process, then the manager will be permanently busy, because as soon as the queue drains, it'll be well past time to reload the queue from disk.\r\n    - This only works if the queue _actually empties_ - as foreshadowed above, if the queue never empties (because SLAs) then step 4 will never kick in, and we'll never reload the queue. Step 3 will ensure that within a short interval any deleted dags are removed from the queue (should they happen to be one of the ones generating SLAs) but updated and newly added dag files will not be picked up.\r\n    - To be clear, this is the problem I alluded to in my comments at the end of the previous MR after it got merged.\r\n\r\nLocally, I tested a hacky fix whereby on receipt of a SLA callback I still add the callback, but I simply _didn't add the dag to the queue_ (it's a one-line change - extremely simple!). This works, but means that SLA callbacks are only processed when the queue drains, and is reprocessed (because then all dags are added to the queue, guaranteeing that we will process any outstanding SLA callbacks). However, If someone has specified a large wait time between loading dags from disk, this will affect how timely the SLA alerts are, which is fine for me, because I don't do that, but I wasn't getting a \"this will be fine for everyone\" vibe from the change (I did say it was hacky!).\r\n\r\nAlso, there's another catch. While the problem is much more prevalent with SLAs, these are not the only callbacks. I could envisage a situation where someone configures a dag with a very small interval (e.g. a dag run every 10 seconds). While I think this is a much more theoretical problem that might not ever exist in the wild - this isn't really the use case Airflow is intended for - the upshot would be that a dag generating lots of dag callbacks would be spamming the queue. And those callbacks still go to the _front_ of the queue, i.e. you're back to the situation I tried to solve in the previous MR!\r\n\r\n# I don't think that word means what you think it means\r\n\r\nI decided that fundamentally, part of the the problem was that the queue should be FIFO. And it wasn't. But if I made it FIFO, then the higher priority DAG callbacks would have to wait their turn behind the dag files loaded from disk, and I'm pretty sure stopping that would eliminate some of the speed-ups Airflow 2 was trumpeted as solving. Airflow 1 used to have on average a 15 second gap (= 30/2) between one task completing and the downstream tasks being scheduled, because once the task completed, you had to wait for the manager to drain the queue, add the files to the queue from disk, and then process the dag. (And that's assuming you could even process all your dags in &lt;30 seconds...). In Airflow 2, because of the dag callbacks, the gap between downstream tasks being scheduled is usually sub-second.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to be the guy who accidentally breaks _that_ particular speed up. :scream: \r\n\r\nSo I did two things:\r\n\r\n## Thing 1: Tackling the FIFO issue aka gazumping callbacks.\r\n1. I split the existing queue into two: a priority queue, and a standard queue. the priority queue is drained before the standard queue.\r\n2. You can probably guess what goes where, but: the dag callbacks go into the priority queue, while the SLAs callbacks and dags found on disk are added to the standard queue.\r\n3. **Both queues are FIFO.** This means that rapidly updating dags can't gazump other slightly-less-rapidly updating dags, because they go to the back. Of course, most of the time, there's only one dag with callbacks in the priority queue, and there's no material change in behaviour. \r\n4. Hypothetically, the priority queue could be permanently busy. If this happens, it'll be like it was with the SLAs; the standard queue would never get a look-in, and we'd stop processing new/updated dags.\r\n5. So **I also added a new config param**, This is called `max_file_process_interval` and it's the dual to the existing `min_file_process_interval`. It guarantees that if you do happen to have a permanently busy priority queue, eventually we'll take a breather, and process the files on disk anyway.\r\n6. By default, this flag is set to 120 seconds. Setting it to zero disables it, i.e. you can have a permanently busy priority queue.\r\n7. I am acutely aware / wary of the fact that this separation-of-the-queues-plus-config-param is purely solving a problem that is (for me at least) purely a theoretically-possible issue. I've never seen it, but I don't think it's premature optimisation to tackle it in this change.\r\n\r\n## Thing 2: Handling the fact that SLAs stop the standard queue from ever being empty.\r\n1. As noted ... somewhere ... above, a hacky fix was to simply stop adding dags to the queue on SLA callback. But this wasn't perfect for people who don't happen to use airflow the way I do.\r\n2. So, the first half of Thing 2 was to make the standard queue FIFO. This is effectively upholding the change from the previous MR; SLA callbacks simply get treated the same as dags loaded from disk, and have to wait their turn.\r\n3. The next bit was to then add a `set` which tracked which dag files in the queue were still outstanding from the last refresh from disk. Once the queue was refreshed from disk, we'd work through every file eventually (because FIFO), and at that point the set would be empty, even if the queue wasn't (because SLAs).\r\n4. Once the set was empty, we'd refresh the queue with dags found on disk.\r\n5. Some of those dags from disk _might already be in the queue due to SLAs_ but we don't care; this is a good thing as it means loading dags from disk doesn't push existing SLAs to the back of the line. \r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nThis doesn't materially change _how_ SLAs work; they are generated and consumed the same as before. It just means that we reliably consume the alerts once generated without breaking the rest of the system. In my experience at least, adding SLAs would simply cause the system to stop processing dag updates (as per #15596).\r\n\r\nIn particular, I don't address issues with SLA timestamps (as raised by #22532), nor do I deal with other problems (e.g. now SLAs fire reliably, I have noticed that they fire during catch-up, and that the same alert can fire multiple times).\r\n\r\nThis is not because I think the current approach is perfect (like everyone else on the internet, I Have Thoughts on how it could be improved, given infinite time) but rather it is a sad-but-true fact that I don't have the time to take on a big project. So I am going to continue with my current approach of tinkering round the edges; and if the remaining issues are minor enough to live with, I'm just going to live with them (at least for now).\r\n\r\n# Summary: I'm from the UK; politely waiting in line is what we do best.\r\n\r\n- Separation of manager's `_file_path_queue` to `_std_file_path_queue` (for SLAs and dags loaded from disk) and `priority_file_path_queue` (for DAG call backs)\r\n- New `max_file_process_interval` config to ensure files are read from disk every so often, even if the priority queue is always busy\r\n- Dags from disk will be added to std queue even if the std queue is still busy with SLAs.\r\n- Some extra stats/metrics to track queue depths / progress\r\n- Tests updated to reflect changes\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-27T10:33:29Z","updated_at":"2022-12-18T00:11:45Z","closed_at":"2022-12-18T00:11:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f44374f45cb46da0938d03499f7d532dd3d6bf3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

the mount permissions of the volume to the pod.\r\n\r\n**The reason for adding**\r\nThe development teams in my organization use the ability to write to the dags directory at the time the dags are initialized. When switching from custom charts, dugs with this code are no longer initialized in Airflow. Rewriting the code of dags without using the ability to manipulate files in a directory is a rather laborious task. Therefore, it was decided to add this flag. I think that it will be right to provide a choice of how to mount a volume with dags.","created_at":"2022-10-27T03:43:31Z","updated_at":"2022-12-18T00:11:47Z","closed_at":"2022-12-18T00:11:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6db240260a1f80d19d1c29f56c7cc2306257c807","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

were some issues with transient state changes with the `RedshiftResumeClusterOperator` and the `RedshiftPauseClusterOperator`, which resulted in errors being thrown, and causing system tests to fail. This PR solves the issue by allowing multiple attempts to pause or resume the cluster if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nThis PR also contains a minor fix on the `get_cluster_snapshot_status` function, which is to remove a redundant parameter `cluster_identifier`, which was originally being passed to the `describe_cluster_snapshots` function. The function only accepts one of the two parameters currently provided: either the `snapshot_identifier` or the `cluster_identifier`. Passing both to the function raises an `InvalidParameterCombination` exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

images uses different parameter than ci.yml for building the images (all-python* instead of python*). This is to account for the fact that we only have one build-image.yml workflow for all airflow versions (in main) and we need to account for the fact that different versions of airflow will have support for different Python versions. This was not happening for a while, but it will soon start being needed for Python 3.11 that will be supported in 2.5 but not supported in 3.11.\r\n\r\nBy mistake #27215 added displaying of upgraded dependencies with wrong parameter name in build-images.yml copied from ci.yml that caused a problem for PRs that were changing dependencies but did not trigger full build.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/issues/1386\r\n- [x] Databricks Provider:\r\n  https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-python/issues/59\r\n- [x] Papermill Provider: https://github.com/nteract/papermill/issues/700 (it does not seem blocking the papermil provider from being released. We will release it wiht the hope the functionality we use and test works.\r\n- [x] Azure Provider: https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-python/issues/334\r\n  and https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/27066\r\n- [x] Apache Beam Provider: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23848\r\n- [x] Snowflake Provider: https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/1349/files\r\n- [x] JDBC Provider: https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype/pull/1087\r\n- [x] Hive Provider: https://github.com/cloudera/python-sasl/issues/30 (mitigated by excluding the provider from 3.11)\r\n- [x] Plyvel: dependency: https://github.com/wbolster/plyvel/issues/148\r\n\r\nWe might decide to release Airflow in 3.11 with those providers\r\ndisabled in case they are lagging behind eventually, but for the\r\nmoment we want to work with all the projects in concert to be\r\nable to release all providers (Google Provider requires quite\r\na lot of work and likely Google Team stepping up and community helping\r\nwith migration to latest Goofle cloud libraries)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This is a very big limitation considering that this functionality is not critical and many existing pipelines require an older version.  On the other hand, this restriction is not checked if the user installs beam in a separate virtual environment. On the other hand, this restriction is not checked if the user installs beam in a separate virtual environment. Then Apache Beam starts, but unsupported options are passed.\r\n\r\nTo solve these two problems, I moved the Apache Beam version check to runtime and use the old version restrictions in `providers.yaml`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I will unblock the work on Snowpark integration which requires `cloudpickle` 2.0.0 while Apache Beam 2.39.0 requires `cloudpickle` 2.1.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nCC:

PR improves the ways important information is printed in CI.\r\n\r\nCurrently some of the errors and important information is printed inside the folded console output when they are run. This is nice to have the folded content in case of success but in case of error we want to surface errors directly in the CI output so that the user does not have to find and unfold the information. Sometimes (for example in printing which dependencies got upgraded) we also want to surface some important part of the output even if there is a success.\r\n\r\nThis is a foundational change that makes it possible and easy, we are going to add more of those as we find them.\r\n\r\nThis change improves surfacing of the information in three cases:\r\n\r\n1) Test failures\r\n\r\nWhen there is an error in tests, we should now see the (only the part containing error and traceback) see the failure details outside of the folded content - the folded content will still contain all the details of the test run, but you would not have to unfold it in order to see the actual error.\r\n\r\n2) Errors when testing provider installation\r\n\r\nWhen there are errors when installing providers, the errors were initially inside of the folded \"run\" command and the run command did not even have indication that there was an error (just exit code information was printed). This change ends CI group when errors are detected (in CI) which makes the errors show up outside of the group.\r\n\r\n3) Showing changed constraints\r\n\r\nShowing changed constraints when upgrading to newer dependencies is always interesting - regardless from being it error or success. With this change, we are showing just the constraints printed in the main logs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

PR is designed to restructure the overcrowded and confusing sidebar of the Astronomer Documentation. This is intended to allow for further scalability of the airflow docs, and to increase user-friendliness to new users. \r\n\r\nThe current docs have 28 top-level pages and two sub-sections of substance: \"How-to Guides\" and \"Concepts.\"  Here I've attempted to clean up the sidebar and make the structure more clear by both splitting \"Concepts\" into three new top-level pages (\"Core Concepts,\" \"Authoring and Scheduling\" and \"Administration and Deployment\") and folding many of the current top-level pages into these categories. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the docs as they currently are is visually here: The left column is representative of the top-level sidebar, with the concepts subsection broken out to the right. How-to guides is another large section, but because it didn't undergo any substantial change I've hidden the sub-pages for ease of understanding.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"770\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-24

RotatingFileHandler is used when you enable it via `CONFIG_PROCESSOR_MANAGER_LOGGER=True` and it exhibits similar behaviour as the FileHandler had when it comes to caching the file on the Kernel level. While it is harmless (the cache will be freed when needed), it is also misleading for those who are trying to understand memory usage by Airlfow.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add a custom non-caching RotatingFileHandler similarly as in #18054.\r\n\r\nNote that it will require to manually modify local settings if the settings were created before this change.\r\n\r\nFixes: #27065\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI would like to run system tests for Snowflake on CI to make sure there is no regression, but unfortunately running these tests on Github Action was never successful.\r\nI took a look and ran into a few problems:\r\n* Missing `schedule=\"@once\"` which means that the DAG were run every day in the range from `start_date` to `current_date`. I think `catchup = False` should fix that, but it doesn't. DAG Runes were still being created, which in effect meant that the DAGs never completed the expected time - <60 seconds.\r\n* I moved all the other operators to other files because I would like to focus only on `SnowflakeOperator` first. But as a next step, I would also like to fix the tests for `s3_to_snowflake` and `snowflake_to_slack`, but this is an extra effort.\r\n* I created a missing SQL file that was used by system tests. Unfortunately, this file cannot contain the license header, because Snowflake interprets the license header as a new SQL query, and we can only send one SQL query per request.  This is something that might be worth fixing, but for now, I'd like to run system tests without making any changes to the operator.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the

At the same time those options have 'expose_value' set to False which make them not passed down that @click.command decorated functions as function arguments (and the same change is applied to `answer` option that has already been saved in static variable\r\n\r\nThe --help output was reviewed and standardized across multiple commands.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
