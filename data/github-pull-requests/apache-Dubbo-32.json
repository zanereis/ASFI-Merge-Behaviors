Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThere exists bug when config ReferenceBean by the way of static @Bean method or @Bean method in @Component java config. You can run the following two tests in this pr:\r\n- dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/boot/conditional5/JavaConfigReferenceBeanConditionalTest5.java\r\n- dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/boot/conditional7/JavaConfigReferenceBeanConditionalTest7.java\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n  The original author use beanFactory#getType() as the ReferenceConfig's  interface name, which may cause early instantiation but get null objectType in the case of static @Bean method or @Bean method in @Component java config bean to build ReferenceBean.\r\nHere I modify the above logic and just get the return generic type as interface name from the @Bean method at the registry time. And all the config ReferenceBean case with @Bean method is supported, the original usage is also compatible. When the ReferenceBean is configured in the same method name, I just get common ancestor of return generic type here like the spring internals do.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/boot/conditional5/JavaConfigReferenceBeanConditionalTest5.java\r\n- dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/boot/conditional5/JavaConfigReferenceBeanConditionalTest6.java\r\n- dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/boot/conditional7/JavaConfigReferenceBeanConditionalTest7.java\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

i\r\n\r\nncorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-31T05:52:19Z","updated_at":"2022-10-08T08:04:05Z","closed_at":"2022-09-08T02:08:33Z","merged_at":"2022-09-08T02:08:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"72326f42ba2add37b5f22541ad40fc3644dbe156","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/57","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/57","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/57/labels","id":8311142,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AftFm","number":57,"title":"3.0.12","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-08-16T09:06:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:07Z","due_on":"2022-09-18T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T02:35:07Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0e41bcdff7d12fa8cee102ccc88ebdffbf7b0228","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feature/local_refer_support_mergeable","ref":"feature/local_refer_support_mergeable","sha":"0e41bcdff7d12fa8cee102ccc88ebdffbf7b0228","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/9640\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-30T06:15:40Z","updated_at":"2022-02-06T04:36:01Z","closed_at":"2022-02-06T04:36:00Z","merged_at":"2022-02-06T04:36:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"1bf7396fb74b7a920b0ff75089c6498f3fddd14f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/48","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/48","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/48/labels","id":7475174,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Acg_m","number":48,"title":"3.0.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-10T07:41:35Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T02:51:43Z","due_on":"2022-01-31T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T02:51:43Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9644/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9644/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9644/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/36ee9716381f51299c2b343281dcdaa457cdc0db","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/callback_group","ref":"fix/callback_group","sha":"36ee9716381f51299c2b343281dcdaa457cdc0db","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-27T12:22:47Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T02:24:52Z","closed_at":"2022-01-28T02:24:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e263304f97d794e47a79ff54a475a77562deb8af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/071e41f34b58501cd7d1704303abda36e509f3e9","head":{"label":"smartboot:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"071e41f34b58501cd7d1704303abda36e509f3e9","user":{"login":"smartboot","id":20201189,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwMjAxMTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20201189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot","html_url":"https://github.com/smartboot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smartboot/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"dfe4fcaea107ac292e6f2e967807a0756f59c7e3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe DubboDeployApplicationListener currently processes all applicationContext event from current ApplicationContext and all its child applicationContext. It will cause duplicate deployment and ApplicationDeployListener will receive multi duplicate vents. The most bad is that, when the application uses hot load of  child spring context, and destroys the child spring context at runtime,  the dubbo infrastructure will be destroyed once receives the child spring context's ContextClosedEvent. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\ndubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/context/DubboConfigApplicationListener.java\r\ndubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/spring/context/DubboDeployApplicationListener.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nsee the case code in https://github.com/jessin20161124/dubbo_demo.\r\n\r\n1.   java -Dspring.profiles.active=provider -Dserver.port=9999 -jar target/dubbo_demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n2. curl http://localhost:9999/practice/testGetSubApp\r\n3. curl http://localhost:9999/practice/testDestroySubApp\r\n4. watch the application log, the dubbo application runs normally.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-27T08:48:41Z","updated_at":"2022-01-29T07:06:46Z","closed_at":"2022-01-29T07:06:46Z","merged_at":"2022-01-29T07:06:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"467d83202e164702022884cc166fcb763701d6f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/48","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/48","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/48/labels","id":7475174,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Acg_m","number":48,"title":"3.0.6","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-12-10T07:41:35Z","updated_at":"2022-03-07T02:51:43Z","due_on":"2022-01-31T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-03-07T02:51:43Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a2dabb5dd573d6b50c3b8534d4ddd34602ffa87a","head":{"label":"jessin20161124:fix-duplicateDeployListen","ref":"fix-duplicateDeployListen","sha":"a2dabb5dd573d6b50c3b8534d4ddd34602ffa87a","user":{"login":"jessin20161124","id":23723332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzIzMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23723332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124","html_url":"https://github.com/jessin20161124","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445976723,"node_id":"R_kgDOGpUQkw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jessin20161124/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jessin20161124","id":23723332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzIzMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23723332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124","html_url":"https://github.com/jessin20161124","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessin20161124/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jessin20161124/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-25T07:45:26Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T09:40:37Z","closed_at":"2022-02-06T04:32:56Z","merged_at":"2022-02-06T04:32:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"4774c98497fd839620c049922afff52ebee00fce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ce74470e5d6d46a7772885982b13a8ff0c5692e2","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/release_resource","ref":"fix/release_resource","sha":"ce74470e5d6d46a7772885982b13a8ff0c5692e2","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-24T03:35:06Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T13:47:09Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T13:47:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b785c817f94479a471df1a8741b87ffb8cca7ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5cca296fcbc4e42f1e3731fa9ad583fbd8c0236b","head":{"label":"juzi214032:refactor/PojoUtils/depracated","ref":"refactor/PojoUtils/depracated","sha":"5cca296fcbc4e42f1e3731fa9ad583fbd8c0236b","user":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":441908464,"node_id":"R_kgDOGlb88A","name":"dubbo","full_name":"juzi214032/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-22T14:20:05Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T14:04:29Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T14:04:29Z","merged_at":"2022-03-15T14:04:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"7cf49db41dc2cd411e4defe2909177f1b84fa653","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/49","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/49","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/49/labels","id":7563794,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Ac2oS","number":49,"title":"2.7.16","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":33,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-01-12T03:31:22Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T09:03:24Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-07-16T08:42:06Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1b22d0cad7f7fc02ae811cfc2e805e5bc3616da2","head":{"label":"codeimport:fix-forking-npe","ref":"fix-forking-npe","sha":"1b22d0cad7f7fc02ae811cfc2e805e5bc3616da2","user":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197110349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcxMTAzNDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"codeimport/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/user

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #9582 \r\nWhen the cluster uses the forking mode and the provider side all times out ,consumer side will npe\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\norg.apache.dubbo.rpc.cluster.support.ForkingClusterInvoker\r\norg.apache.dubbo.rpc.cluster.support.ForkingClusterInvokerTest\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the cluster uses the forking mode and the provider side all times out, the poll method used in forkingClusterInvoker will time out earlier than the provider side, so it will get null from the queue and throw NPE in the subsequent process. The poll method here should not set the timeout time, but wait for the provider to timeout. When the provider times out, the poll method will correctly obtain an RpcException\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-22T14:03:08Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T14:03:33Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T14:03:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f4f4c19af82485faf17ff64c2b336f4ef69ad09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec78ca1c90a489e1b1be2528e13a10a6848ed1c3","head":{"label":"codeimport:fix-forkingclusterinvoker-npe","ref":"fix-forkingclusterinvoker-npe","sha":"ec78ca1c90a489e1b1be2528e13a10a6848ed1c3","user":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197110349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcxMTAzNDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"codeimport/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nthe setting in application such as \"dubbo.application.qosEnable\" is useless, you must set \"dubbo.application.qos-enable\" to enable QoS, But they are supposed to be be equivalent\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\ni may not be able to express the bug and my action ​explictly in English, so i would like to use Chinese then.\r\n现状：\r\n目前只有这一个属性（qosEnable qos-enable）不一致，因为目前只有这个属性是kebab-case的默认property\r\n如果日后新加默认kebab-case的属性，也会导致用户配置失效\r\n\r\n本pr：\r\n兼容kebab-case与camelCase配置；\r\n保证用户配置不会被默认配置覆盖；\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n原因：\r\n错误发生流程：\r\nprecondition： dubbo通过反射进行环境变量值绑定，而在绑定过程中做匹配的都是kebab-case的值\r\n\r\n0. 假设我在property文件中设置了dubbo.application.qosEnable = true（待会我们会看到这个设置如何无效化的）\r\n1. dubbo实现了一个spring的EnvironmentPostProcessor接口，实现类是DubboDefaultPropertiesEnvironmentPostProcessor。这个类会设置一些默认配置，包括dubbo.application.qos-enable=false，这个kebab-case的.qos-enable是罪魁祸首。\r\n2. spring环境初始化过程中，会调很多个不同优先级的EnvironmentPostProcessor，DubboDefaultPropertiesEnvironmentPostProcessor在的执行优先级被设置为最低，于是它会在spring加载完其余所有环境变量后执行（此时，我们的environmentMap中，已经有用户配置<dubbo.application.qosEnable , true>），在设置完默认值后，它会执行addOrReplace方法，这是合理的，只有没有用户配置才应该加默认配置。但是问题来了：”dubbo.application.qosEnable“ != \"dubbo.application.qos-enable\" 即使我们设置了qosEnable，默认值还是加成功了！\r\n3. 在最后的绑定值前，ConfigurationUtils.getSubProperties会把environmentMap中qosEnable这种小驼峰格式的值（<dubbo.application.qosEnable , true>）转化为kebab-case（<dubbo.application.qos-nable , true>），再插回到environmentMap里。\r\n4. 插入方法是putIfAbsent，但是我们的默认值<dubbo.application.qos-enable, false>已经在map里了！插入失败！我们后面使用的其实是默认值 false\r\n\r\n修改方法：\r\n在默认配置添加完后进行额外处理，将所有kebab-case的默认配置转为camelCase，比如qos相关的默认配置将转化为qosEnable 。\r\n\r\n正确性：\r\n如果用户采用kebab-case的配置，则默认配置将被静默（就和现在用户配置被静默的原理一样，不过只是默认配置不生效）\r\n如果用户采用camelCase的配置，则DubboDefaultPropertiesEnvironmentPostProcessor时，默认配置不会成功添加，因为已经有用户默认配置\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. #9597 \r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-20T04:57:53Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T06:36:33Z","closed_at":"2022-01-20T04:58:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7f4454d12afa7aba16799a1a49a04363aa37f3cf","head":{"label":"warmonipa:bugfix/parameters-parse","ref":"bugfix/parameters-parse","sha":"7f4454d12afa7aba16799a1a49a04363aa37f3cf","user":{"login":"warmonipa","id":1324712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa","html_url":"https://github.com/warmonipa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357747653,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc3NDc2NTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"warmonipa/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warmonipa","id":1324712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa","html_url":"https://github.com/warmonipa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warmonipa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warmonipa/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-15T13:24:10Z","updated_at":"2024-08-17T08:32:52Z","closed_at":"2022-02-06T04:24:20Z","merged_at":"2022-02-06T04:24:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9798036c8b6b4bdd998378437968408a5ae8f63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/09f2f37c45997345b2e3f10825aa74a9de9bf256","head":{"label":"juzi214032:refactor/ForkingClusterInvoker","ref":"refactor/ForkingClusterInvoker","sha":"09f2f37c45997345b2e3f10825aa74a9de9bf256","user":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":441908464,"node_id":"R_kgDOGlb88A","name":"dubbo","full_name":"juzi214032/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-15T13:05:01Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T01:08:41Z","closed_at":"2022-02-17T01:08:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a355f1e3a29a73c0664614608fc7fbe0dad4524","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5ac0fb84ce3b3b8d8538c0abcc3661559ffc6fc3","head":{"label":"tanoak10:fix_bigDecimal_convert","ref":"fix_bigDecimal_convert","sha":"5ac0fb84ce3b3b8d8538c0abcc3661559ffc6fc3","user":{"login":"tanoak10","id":37281126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjgxMTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37281126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10","html_url":"https://github.com/tanoak10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanoak10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8240ea26cb00a52dd000d99e3997fe554134b9c3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPasses the unit tests of `InternalThreadLocalTest`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-11T08:30:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T09:43:52Z","closed_at":"2022-01-11T09:43:52Z","merged_at":"2022-01-11T09:43:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"1da62dbf048fd31a75de5c437d8e41d601db6642","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/88604d77dd694c2569ffe53bb4cc639a50fa1b3d","head":{"label":"guohao:fix-pb-cve","ref":"fix-pb-cve","sha":"88604d77dd694c2569ffe53bb4cc639a50fa1b3d","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

[x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-11T07:40:56Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T07:50:57Z","closed_at":"2022-01-11T07:50:57Z","merged_at":"2022-01-11T07:50:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8e2d8f7032860120ed599eb68a524b3b1535cc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f65316ac76634e2819ac8f2f793948ade9bc5344","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0111_support_remove","ref":"0111_support_remove","sha":"f65316ac76634e2819ac8f2f793948ade9bc5344","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

if the parameter is empty\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nJava EE has been renamed from javax to jakarta, Related jar packages no longer use the package name starting with javax, including the jsr-303 api. To support Hibernate Validator 7.x, a new JValidatorNew file has been added for compatibility with version 7.x\r\n\r\nclose #9544\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Add JValidatorNew, use new api.\r\n- ValidationFilter masks implementation class exceptions\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nI can't write new unit tests because Hibernate Validator 7.x and 6.x can't exist under the classpath at the same time and there would be a class conflict. But I have tested 7.x separately in my development environment and it works fine, so I hope someone else can test it again to make sure it works!\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-09T07:13:58Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T07:17:27Z","closed_at":"2022-01-09T07:17:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8658cbb1e170e2fb88a1b7ad8729cc5add2c6b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/79b845d3f11c010d3fa463e27a4fb5d2a41c155e","head":{"label":"codeimport:fix-multi-registry-weight","ref":"fix-multi-registry-weight","sha":"79b845d3f11c010d3fa463e27a4fb5d2a41c155e","user":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197110349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcxMTAzNDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"codeimport/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-09T02:55:52Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T06:45:22Z","closed_at":"2022-01-09T06:45:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbd9c3a387b267be3bbea1bdbadb8d53bc9fb015","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c2941538d72c35f96b1434eb015b85c8ab0983e3","head":{"label":"codeimport:fix/multi-registry-loadbalance","ref":"fix/multi-registry-loadbalance","sha":"c2941538d72c35f96b1434eb015b85c8ab0983e3","user":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197110349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcxMTAzNDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"codeimport/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codeimport","id":28983726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTgzNzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28983726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport","html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeimport/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codeimport/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-30T13:33:35Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T08:51:55Z","closed_at":"2022-01-23T08:51:55Z","merged_at":"2022-01-23T08:51:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"7eab64dcac1df5c8b06ba48f973c1bb73dc9912e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c63683a8cda146889fcfd427ba7251062a3e93b9","head":{"label":"juzi214032:refactor/extension-loader/extension-annotation","ref":"refactor/extension-loader/extension-annotation","sha":"c63683a8cda146889fcfd427ba7251062a3e93b9","user":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":441908464,"node_id":"R_kgDOGlb88A","name":"dubbo","full_name":"juzi214032/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe wrong metadata report address was used, causing the demo project to fail to start.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nChange the metadata report address to the correct local IP address.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-29T11:29:02Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T13:52:29Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T13:52:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef36c413a01f0338d201eba172ae80e474575c1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7ada38737a4202b3b09e7728d9d6d5973abaa054","head":{"label":"BurningCN:optimize_container","ref":"optimize_container","sha":"7ada38737a4202b3b09e7728d9d6d5973abaa054","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-28T13:09:22Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T03:43:00Z","closed_at":"2021-12-29T03:43:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa238c4e990bae5c2104c383f2d1fab2ba6db90e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ffe2d063d9791cb17bef4ac5c6c1e5296a94b428","head":{"label":"BurningCN:optimize_containers","ref":"optimize_containers","sha":"ffe2d063d9791cb17bef4ac5c6c1e5296a94b428","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6443\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-28T07:43:36Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T08:48:37Z","closed_at":"2022-01-23T08:48:37Z","merged_at":"2022-01-23T08:48:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1cd33bee80df038221b787a8f4590fe2d16e9fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/44f6d91b733440ecc7a89915ca48feffc8888b27","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:3.0_feature/lazy_connect_client_reconnect","ref":"3.0_feature/lazy_connect_client_reconnect","sha":"44f6d91b733440ecc7a89915ca48feffc8888b27","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix  https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/9466\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. Add timeout check before send response at server side\r\n2. Add channel active check before write to wire\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-27T07:39:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-25T10:16:48Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T03:16:55Z","merged_at":"2022-01-17T03:16:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f4dc265c089b80dd31fe06e1ecd9c9902e75dd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7a10669f11deea8ffa52c48b542a072087d99800","head":{"label":"guohao:fix-9466","ref":"fix-9466","sha":"7a10669f11deea8ffa52c48b542a072087d99800","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\nThe truth value returned by this method is equivalent to: getAnnotation(annotationClass) != null\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-26T15:11:11Z","updated_at":"2021-12-26T16:26:29Z","closed_at":"2021-12-26T16:26:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"834bc8ca316cadfb97c82abfa25ba4f2587616f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3fd0e37c7acf1a9f7cc48fecb75b54b1d7c09e63","head":{"label":"juzi214032:refactor/extension-loader/annotation-present","ref":"refactor/extension-loader/annotation-present","sha":"3fd0e37c7acf1a9f7cc48fecb75b54b1d7c09e63","user":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":441908464,"node_id":"R_kgDOGlb88A","name":"dubbo","full_name":"juzi214032/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juzi214032","id":38206169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA2MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38206169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032","html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juzi214032/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juzi214032/dubbo","description":"Apache

the current implementation, org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.dubbo.DecodeableRpcInvocation#decode(org.apache.dubbo.remoting.Channel, java.io.InputStream) will catch exceptions in readObject, and then only print WARN-level log, If the log level of the provider is ERROR, the error cannot be seen. A common problem is that a NullPointerException be throw when the provider executes business logic. Finally, the consumer gets a NullPointerException, which makes the problem difficult to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the argument class has only one constructor with parameters, and the constructor parameter is a non-primitive type, Hession will initialize the parameter to be null. If the parameter is used in the constructor to execute business logic, it will trigger related exceptions, such as IllegalArgumentException, but in the current implementation, parameter decoding exceptions will be caught. The provider actually gets an null parameter when execute business logic. In most scenarios, a NullPointerException will be thrown to the consumer.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAllow the consumer to get the original argument decode exception to facilitate troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRemove the exception catch and log printing logic when calling readObject, and throw it directly to the outer decode method so that the exception is set into the request instance, and finally sent to the consumer.\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-24T06:49:25Z","updated_at":"2021-12-24T06:50:39Z","closed_at":"2021-12-24T06:50:39Z","merged_at":"2021-12-24T06:50:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e8f5544df23289c12c8ecea3d2accef3f2fd99a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/aaeefacc4e11309d83b49d5355b3b7d8fd97d1dc","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1224_cl","ref":"1224_cl","sha":"aaeefacc4e11309d83b49d5355b3b7d8fd97d1dc","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-23T05:50:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T06:47:58Z","closed_at":"2021-12-23T06:47:58Z","merged_at":"2021-12-23T06:47:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"897cd0f62e2e7531a4c1cbc0da9bf282aed5f4e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/9474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/9474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d748273a1445d161879406c60044ea5b8785a4b1","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1223_remove_json","ref":"1223_remove_json","sha":"d748273a1445d161879406c60044ea5b8785a4b1","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache
