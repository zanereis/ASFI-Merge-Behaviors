What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a better error message when a JVM UDF cannot be deserialized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn some cases a UDF cannot be deserialized. The happens when a lambda references itself (typically through the capturing class). Java cannot deserialize such an object graph because SerializedLambda's are serialization proxies which need the full graph to be deserialized before they can be transformed into the actual lambda. This is not possible if there is such a cycle. This PR adds a more readable and understandable error when this happens, the original java one is a `ClassCastException` which does not explain or give any hints of what is actually going on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It will throw an error on the client when a UDF is not deserializable. The error is better and more actionable then what we got before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-31T18:28:29Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T18:54:24Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T18:54:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cd629e91cffabda57d49ccc70f4c64312cd2e9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0170c0026d4bbd1fd6694e438f9aa6a90d83273f","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-29497","ref":"SPARK-29497","sha":"0170c0026d4bbd1fd6694e438f9aa6a90d83273f","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse jobTags in SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart to get the corresponding SQL Execution for Spark Connect request rather than SparkListenerJobStart.props.getProperty(SQLExecution.EXECUTION_ID_KEY), which won't work when the SQL Execution does not trigger a job.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change handles cases where a SQL Execution doesn't trigger a job and we can't retrieve the SQL Execution ID from SparkListenerJobStart\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate unit test + local manual testing\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-31T16:57:10Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T07:15:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T07:15:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4581dd5ebb6c279c29718f56712191c7e33acf97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplement server support and scala client for reattachable execution with two new RPCs:\r\n* ReattachExecute\r\n* ReleaseExecute\r\n\r\nWith reattachable execution, if the response stream of ExecutePlan RPC gets broken, it can be reattached to with ReattachExecute RPC. The server now holds a bit of a backtrack buffer, in case the client coming back with reattach after error did not receive the latest sent responses, and have to backtrack. The client can sends ReleaseExecute responses to let the server know what has already been consumed and can be freed.\r\n\r\n#### Server: ExecuteResponseObserver\r\n\r\nIf ExecuteHolder is reattachable, ExecuteResponseSender is modified to not throw away responses that were returned to ExecuteGrpcResponseSender immediately, but keep a buffer of `spark.connect.execute.reattachable.observerRetryBufferSize` (default 1 MB) responses behind the last returned response. This facilitates returning consumer being able to backtrack in case the last returned response did not successfully arrive at the client.\r\n\r\n#### Server: ExecuteGrpcResponseSender\r\n\r\nIf ExecuteHolder is reattachable, ExecuteGrpcResponseSender is modified to gracefully end the RPC response stream after a given time (`spark.connect.execute.reattachable.senderMaxStreamDuration`, default 5 minutes) or size of responses (`spark.connect.execute.reattachable.senderMaxStreamSize`, default 1 GB). After that the response is completed, and client needs to come back with a ReattachExecute RPC to continue. Clients know whether it's the real end of the results, because ExecuteThreadRunner now puts a marker ResultComplete message at the real end of the stream.\r\n\r\nCutting the stream manually in a graceful way like that can help prevent errors related to long open streams. It also helps with long held idle stream that may get broken because of idleness. The client is able to handle these errors, but this also provides a cleaner way to minimize the number of network errors.\r\n\r\nExecuteGrpcResponseSender also implements flow control of responses sent to the GRPC stream. Normally, grpcResponseObserver.onNext would never block. This doesn't however mean that it would send all responses immediately. The responses could be queued if the client does not keep up receiving and processing them. This queue can grow ubounded, and we don't know what was actually sent, so we don't know how much of a buffer ExecuteResponseObserver really needs to keep. Flow control utilizes functions of ServerCallStreamObserver, which provides means to check if the stream is actually ready to send data, and callbacks to notify when it becomes ready. ExecuteGrpcResponseSender will wait with grpcResponseObserver.onNext until it becomes ready.\r\n\r\nThis also helps with clients that would abandon their result stream. Now we will block from sending the responses, and time out the RPC after senderMaxStreamDuration, instead of pushing the responses to a GRPC outbound queue that is outside our control. The TODO server mechanism would then remove the execution with no RPC attached. Note: in such a situation, responses will still pile up in ExecuteResponseObserver; there is unfortunately no flow control of the Spark task results being pushed to it.\r\n\r\n#### Client: ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator\r\n\r\nClient wraps the whole implementation inside ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator. It's a wrapper that starts with an ExecutePlan result iterator, but if this iterator either finishes without a ResultComplete message, or an intermittent network error occurs, it can acquire a new iterator to continue where it left off: by tracking the last received response, it can request a new iterator from ReattachExecute that starts after that.\r\n\r\nThe client sends ReleaseExecute RPCs asynchronously to release the responses it already consumed (potentially faster than the ExecuteResponseObserver would release from its backtrack buffer). The client doesn't need to check their result or block on them. If something fails, the executions will get cleaned by the TODO cleanup mechanism in the server.\r\n\r\n#### TODO as followup\r\n\r\n* What remains TODO for a followup PR is server mechanism for dealing with executions that have been abandoned - the client did not come back with ReatachExecute, and didn't free the execution with ReleaseExecute. This will be done by an operation manager that monitors all active executions, and interrupts and removes ones that were not released, but don't have any client RPC attached to them for a while.\r\n* Python client implementation is a followup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRobust handling of long running queries in face of intermittent network glitches.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe re-attachable execution mechanism is not exposed in any public API. Several internal configs have been added:\r\n\r\nConnect server configs:\r\n* `spark.connect.execute.reattachable.senderMaxStreamDuration`\r\n* `spark.connect.execute.reattachable.senderMaxStreamSize`\r\n* `spark.connect.execute.reattachable.observerRetryBufferSize`\r\n\r\nConnect scala client configuration element: `useReattachableExecute`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting E2E suite utilize re-attachable execution. The tests have been configure to exercise reattaching by using an extremely low senderMaxStreamDuration and senderMaxStreamSize.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-30T18:25:06Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T07:57:48Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T03:42:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b585c194c0ab813f69b2cfcdb734eeeb43eea9ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b26d6759f552c6a9b0d66001d8a9bb558b7c299","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-44421","ref":"SPARK-44421","sha":"7b26d6759f552c6a9b0d66001d8a9bb558b7c299","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41839 , to fix an unintentional change. That PR added an optimization to return an empty iterator directly if the input iterator is empty. However, checking `inputIterator.hasNext` may trigger query execution, which is different than before. It should be completely lazy and wait for the root operator's iterator to trigger the execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix unintentional change\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdds support for a user to define, register and use Java UDFs. The following APIs are included in this PR:\r\n\r\n- `def udf(f: UDF4[_, _, _, _, _], returnType: DataType): UserDefinedFunction` for [0-10] arguments.\r\n- `def register(name: String, f: UDF4[_, _, _, _, _], returnType: DataType): Unit` for [0-22] arguments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo reach parity with classic Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. A user can now define, register and use Java UDFs. Refer to the following examples (demonstrated in scala for simplicity)\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.api.java._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.LongType\r\n\r\nspark.udf.register(\"javaUdf\", new UDF1[Long, Long] {\r\n  override def call(num: Long): Long = num * num * num + 250L\r\n}, LongType)\r\nspark.sql(\"select javaUdf(id) from range(5)\").as[Long].collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n```scala\r\nArray[Long] = Array(250L, 251L, 258L, 277L, 314L)\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nE2E tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new Spark UI page to display session and execution information for Spark Connect. This builds of the work in SPARK-43923 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41443) that adds the relevant SparkListenerEvents and mirrors the ThriftServerPage in the Spark UI for JDBC/ODBC.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 11 29 22 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/65624911/934b7c69-3b44-460b-8fbb-36a9eb3f0798\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1716\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-27 at 11 29 15 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/65624911/33dbe6ab-44bf-49a5-ad4c-5ba4a476a1f0\">\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis gives users a way to access session and execution information for Spark Connect via the UI and provides the frontend interface for the related SparkListenerEvents.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? Yes, it will add a new tab/page in the Spark UI\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\nCloses #41964 from jasonli-db/spark-connect-ui.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Jason Li

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome queries contains multiple scalar subquery(aggregation without group by clause) and connected with join. The general form of joined aggregates that can be merged as follows:\r\n```\r\n<aggregation function> ::=\r\n  SUM | AVG | MAX | ...\r\n\r\n<aggregation subquery> ::=\r\n  SELECT\r\n    <aggregation function>(...)[ , <aggregation function>(...)[ , ...]]\r\n  FROM [tab | query]\r\n\r\n<joined aggregation > ::=\r\n  SELECT *\r\n  FROM (\r\n    <aggregation subquery> [INNER | CROSS | LEFT | RIGHT | FULL OUTER] JOIN\r\n    <aggregation subquery> [INNER | CROSS | LEFT | RIGHT | FULL OUTER] JOIN\r\n      ...\r\n    <aggregation subquery> [INNER | CROSS | LEFT | RIGHT | FULL OUTER] JOIN\r\n    <aggregation subquery>\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n  \r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM (SELECT\r\n  avg(power) avg_power,\r\n  count(power) count_power,\r\n  count(DISTINCT power) count_distinct_power\r\nFROM data\r\nWHERE country = \"USA\"\r\n  AND (id BETWEEN 1 AND 3\r\n  OR city = \"Berkeley\"\r\n  OR name = \"Xiao\")) B1,\r\n  (SELECT\r\n    avg(power) avg_power,\r\n    count(power) count_power,\r\n    count(DISTINCT power) count_distinct_power\r\n  FROM data\r\n  WHERE country = \"China\"\r\n    AND (id BETWEEN 4 AND 5\r\n    OR city = \"Hangzhou\"\r\n    OR name = \"Wenchen\")) B2\r\n```\r\nWe can optimize this SQL to the form shown below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  avg(power) avg_power FILTER (country = \"USA\" AND (id BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR city = \"Berkeley\" OR name = \"Xiao\")),\r\n  count(power) count_power FILTER (country = \"USA\" AND (id BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR city = \"Berkeley\" OR name = \"Xiao\")),\r\n  count(DISTINCT power) FILTER (country = \"USA\" AND (id BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR city = \"Berkeley\" OR name = \"Xiao\")),\r\n  avg(power) FILTER (country = \"China\" AND (id BETWEEN 4 AND 5 OR city = \"Hangzhou\" OR name = \"Wenchen\")),\r\n  count(power) FILTER (country = \"China\" AND (id BETWEEN 4 AND 5 OR city = \"Hangzhou\" OR name = \"Wenchen\")),\r\n  count(DISTINCT power) FILTER (country = \"China\" AND (id BETWEEN 4 AND 5 OR city = \"Hangzhou\" OR name = \"Wenchen\"))\r\nFROM data\r\nWHERE\r\n(country = \"USA\"\r\n  AND (id BETWEEN 1 AND 3\r\n  OR city = \"Berkeley\"\r\n  OR name = \"Xiao\")) OR\r\n(country = \"China\"\r\n    AND (id BETWEEN 4 AND 5\r\n    OR city = \"Hangzhou\"\r\n    OR name = \"Wenchen\"))\r\n```\r\nIf we can merge the filters and aggregates, we can scan data source only once and eliminate the join so as avoid shuffle.\r\n\r\nThis PR also supports eliminate nested Join, please refer to: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds/q28.sql\r\n\r\nObviously, this change will improve the performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR also reuse some functions come from `MergeScalarSubqueries`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also add some `TreePattern` for easy to check the cost of predicate.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the performance for the case show above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. new test cases\r\n2. new micro benchmark.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark CombineJoinedAggregates:                     Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd jobTags to SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part [SPARK-43952](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43952), users can define job tags via SparkContext.addJobTag. These tags are then used to trigger cancelation via SparkContext.cancelJobsByTag. Furthermore, these tags can be used to logically group multiple jobs together.\r\n\r\nListener of job events can retrieve job tags via  SparkListenerJobStart.props.getProperty(SparkContext.SPARK_JOB_TAGS)\r\n\r\nListener of SQL events can link SparkListenerJobStart & SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart via SparkListenerJobStart.props.getProperty(SQLExecution.EXECUTION_ID_KEY).\r\n\r\nHowever, some SQL executions do not trigger jobs (i.e. commands). As such listeners of SQL executions cannot resolve job tags of all executions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n```\r\ntestOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix double encryption issue for migrated shuffle blocks\r\n\r\nShuffle blocks upon migration are sent without decryption when io.encryption is enabled. The code on the receiving side ends up using serializer.wrapStream on the OutputStream to the file which results in the already encrypted bytes being encrypted again when the bytes are written out.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of serializerManager.wrapStream on the receiving side and also adds tests that validate that this works as expected. I have also validated that the added tests will fail if the fix is not in place.\r\n\r\nJira ticket with more details: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44588\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMigrated shuffle blocks will be double encrypted when `spark.io.encryption = true` without this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to test shuffle block migration with spark.io.encryption enabled and also fixes a test helper method to properly construct the SerializerManager with the encryption key.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-28T19:33:35Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T08:51:20Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T21:33:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8ac4cc5a7a0d7ec4a5b454a53ac8e2279cdc77b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/434dbc85a7e815fd98ce86676293bdbd3483a476","head":{"label":"henrymai:fix_shuffle_migration_double_encryption","ref":"fix_shuffle_migration_double_encryption","sha":"434dbc85a7e815fd98ce86676293bdbd3483a476","user":{"login":"henrymai","id":136857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai","html_url":"https://github.com/henrymai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":647863473,"node_id":"R_kgDOJp2csQ","name":"spark","full_name":"henrymai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"henrymai","id":136857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai","html_url":"https://github.com/henrymai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/henrymai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/henrymai/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded `client_type` information to the `AddArtifactsRequest` and `ArtifactStatusesRequest` by having `ArtifactManager` take in the `SparkConnectClient.Configuration` param instead of just `userContext` (the configuration provides both the `userContext` and the `userAgent` (i.e the client type))\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe client_type information is missing for the `AddArtifactsRequest` and `ArtifactStatusesRequest` compared to the other requests (e.g `analyze`, `execute` etc).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the condition to raise the following warning in MLLib's RankingMetrics ndcgAk function: \"# of ground truth set and # of relevance value set should be equal, check input data\"\r\n\r\nThe logic for raising warnings is faulty at the moment: it raises a warning if the `rel` input is empty and `lab.size` and `rel.size` are not equal.\r\n\r\nThe logic should be to raise a warning if `rel` input is **not empty** and `lab.size` and `rel.size` are not equal.\r\n\r\nThis warning was added in the following PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36843\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith the current logic, RankingMetrics will:\r\n- raise incorrect warning when a user is using it in the \"binary\" mode (i.e. no relevance values in the input)\r\n- not raise warning (that could be necessary) when the user is using it in the \"non-binary\" model (i.e. with relevance values in the input)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo change made to the test suite for RankingMetrics:

WriteFileCommand call hasNext() to check if the input is empty.\r\n2. SMJ call findNextJoinRows() to find all matched rows.\r\n2.1 SMJ tries to get the first row in the left child.\r\n2.1.1 Sort 1 will sort all the input rows in the Offheap memory.\r\n2.1.2 Window 1 will read one group data and the first row in next group (named X), return the first row in the first group.\r\n2.2 SMJ tries to get the first row in the right child.\r\n2.2.1 Sort 2 and Window 2 are empty, do nothing.\r\n2.3  Inner SMJ will finish, since there will definitely be no join rows, call earlyCleanupResources() to free offHeap memory.\r\n3. WriteFileCommand call hasNext() again to write the input data to the files.\r\n4. SMJ call findNextJoinRows() to find all matched rows.\r\n4.1 SMJ tries to get the first row in the left child.\r\n4.2 Window 1 tries to add row X into the group buffer, which will accesse unallocated memory, the JVM may or may not crash.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, if SMJ has already been cleaned up, skip iterator on it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBugfix for SMJ.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest in our production environment.\r\nFor unsafe API, when read the unallocated memory, the program may get the old value, or get a unexpected value, or cause the JVM crash.\r\nI don't think the UIT will be stable.\r\n\r\nThe JVM crash stack\r\n```\r\nStack: [0x00007f8a03800000,0x00007f8a04000000],

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds spark.sql.execution.interruptOnCancel that defaults to true to allow interrupting task threads in SQL layer \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, we support interrupting task threads for users by 1) APIs of the spark core module, 2) a thrift config for the SQL module.  Other Spark SQL Apps are limited to using this functionality. Specifically,  the built-in spark-sql-shell lacks a user-controlled knob for interrupting task threads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\ntested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves the error message format for `assertDataFrameEqual` by creating a new custom diff log function, `_context_diff_ `to print all Rows for `actual` and `expected` and highlight their different rows in color.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is needed to clarify the error message for unequal DataFrames. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR affects the error message display for users. See the new error message output examples below.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_utils.py` and `python/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/test_utils.py`.\r\n\r\nExample error messages:\r\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-31 at 7 41 55 PM\"

However, we may just need to shuffle the other side according to the partition transforms defined in KeyGroupedPartitioning. This is especially useful when the other side is relatively small.\r\n1. Add new config `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.shuffle.enabled` to control this feature enable or not.\r\n2. Add `KeyGroupedPartitioner` use to partition when we know the tranform value of another side (KeyGroupedPartitioning at now). Spark already know the partition value with partition id of KeyGroupedPartitioning side in `EnsureRequirements`. Then save it in `KeyGroupedPartitioner` use to shuffle another partition, to make sure the same key data will shuffle into same partition. \r\n3. only `identity` transform will work now. Because have another problem for now, same transform between DS V2 connector implement and catalog function will report different value, before solve this problem, we should only support `identity`. eg: in test package, `YearFunction` https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/functions/transformFunctions.scala#L47 and https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/InMemoryBaseTable.scala#L143\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves error messages when the output of an arrow-optimized Python UDTF cannot be casted to the specified return schema of the UDTF.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make Python UDTFs more user-friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, before this PR, when the output of a UDTF fails to cast to the desired schema, Spark will throw this confusing error message:\r\n```python\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"x: int\")\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def eval(self):\r\n        yield [1, 2],\r\n\r\nTestUDTF().collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 1044, in pyarrow.lib.Array.from_pandas\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 316, in pyarrow.lib.array\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 83, in pyarrow.lib._ndarray_to_array\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 100, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert [1, 2] with type list: tried to convert to int32\r\n```\r\nNow, after this PR, the error message will look like this:\r\n`pyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [UDTF_ARROW_TYPE_CAST_ERROR] Cannot convert the output value of the column 'x' with type 'object' to the specified return type of the column: 'int32'. Please check if the data types match and try again.\r\n`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR decouples the Spark Connect Scala Client from Catalyst, it now used SQL API module instead.\r\n\r\nThere were quite a few changes we still needed to make:\r\n- For testing we needed a bunch of utilities. I have moved these to common-utils.\r\n- I have moved bits and pieces of IntervalUtils to SparkIntervalUtils.\r\n- A lot of small fixes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis reduces the client's dependency tree from ~300 MB of deps to ~30MB. This makes it easier to use the client when you are developing connect applications. On top of this the reduced dependency graph also means folks will be less affected by the clients' classpath.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It changes the classpath exposed by the Spark Connect Scala Client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2023-07-27T03:58:17Z","updated_at":"2023-07-29T01:31:08Z","closed_at":"2023-07-29T01:31:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8eb5ce1dc8195305146b4ec8e6601457700db7e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanges dtype for datetime properties to be inline with pandas 2.0.0.  Please see for more information https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html\r\n\r\nEnabled corresponding tests that were skipped during the update.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be fully compliant with pandas 2.0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Previously dtype for the updated properties (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, dayofweek, dayofyear, quarter, daysinmonth) was int64, and after this change the dtype will be in32.\r\n\r\nPrior to the change\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n\r\nseries = ps.Series(pd.date_range(\"2012-1-1 12:45:31\", periods=3,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade arrow from 12.0.1 to 13.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Arrow 12.0.1 VS 13.0.0\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow/compare/apache-arrow-12.0.1...apache-arrow-13.0.0\r\n\r\n2. Arrow 13.0.0 is the first version to support Java 21.\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/36370\r\n\r\nWhen arrow version 12.0.1 running on Java21, the following error occurred:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: sun.misc.Unsafe or java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.<init>(long, int) not available\r\n       org.apache.arrow.memory.util.MemoryUtil.directBuffer(MemoryUtil.java:167)\r\n       org.apache.arrow.memory.ArrowBuf.getDirectBuffer(ArrowBuf.java:228)\r\n       org.apache.arrow.memory.ArrowBuf.nioBuffer(ArrowBuf.java:223)\r\n       org.apache.arrow.vector.ipc.ReadChannel.readFully(ReadChannel.java:87)\r\n       org.apache.arrow.vector.ipc.message.MessageSerializer.readMessageBody(MessageSerializer.java:727)\r\n       org.apache.arrow.vector.ipc.message.MessageChannelReader.readNext(MessageChannelReader.java:67)\r\n       org.apache.arrow.vector.ipc.ArrowStreamReader.loadNextBatch(ArrowStreamReader.java:145)\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, we can try to enable netty related testing in Java21.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-27T03:21:42Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T07:21:18Z","closed_at":"2023-08-24T07:20:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"baf5ef3c4fbed92663846287f65111e71fabf660","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9defab4c5be33d0a49cc7c753d5dcfaa8c5c4c58","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-44563","ref":"SPARK-44563","sha":"9defab4c5be33d0a49cc7c753d5dcfaa8c5c4c58","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `OptimizeOneRowRelationSubquery` in batch of `Subquery`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo further optimize the query. Currently, `OptimizeOneRowRelationSubquery` cannot optimize the subquery if an optimizable filter exists. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE temporary VIEW v1\r\nAS\r\nSELECT id, 'foo' AS kind FROM (SELECT 1 AS id) t;\r\n\r\nCREATE temporary VIEW v2\r\nAS\r\nSELECT * FROM v1 WHERE kind = (SELECT kind FROM v1 WHERE kind = 'foo');\r\n\r\nEXPLAIN EXTENDED SELECT * FROM v1 JOIN v2 ON v1.id = v2.id;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nJoin Inner\r\n:- Project [1 AS id#18, foo AS kind#19]\r\n:  +- OneRowRelation\r\n+- Project [1 AS id#21, foo AS kind#22]\r\n   +- Filter (foo = scalar-subquery#20 [])\r\n      :  +- Project [foo AS kind#30]\r\n      :     +- OneRowRelation\r\n      +- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nJoin Inner\r\n:- Project [1 AS id#253, foo AS kind#254]\r\n:  +- OneRowRelation\r\n+- Project [1 AS id#256, foo AS kind#257]\r\n   +- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2023-07-27T02:48:49Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T08:53:18Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T08:52:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dab9bd9128e61db7dc69769a686c77874d6eb693","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/10329afdfc88c12eb18630d31175ae253496fbd8","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-44562","ref":"SPARK-44562","sha":"10329afdfc88c12eb18630d31175ae253496fbd8","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467759455,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-FxXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wangyum/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds analysis and planning for PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clause after TABLE arguments for TVF calls.\r\n\r\n* This PR appends `RepartitionByExpressions` and `Sort` logical operators as needed for this purpose.\r\n* This PR also adds `WITH SINGLE PARTITION` syntax to `TABLE` arguments. This indicates that exactly one instance of the UDTF should process all rows in the input relation, and is mutually exclusive with the `PARTITION BY` clause. Then we append `Repartition` instead of `RepartitionBy` to implement this.\r\n* In addition to up dated parsing unit tests, this PR adds end-to-end testing in the Scala `PythonUDTFSuite`. Note that full query execution is not implemented yet, that will come in the next PR since further execution support is needed to detect when partition boundaries end by inspecting the values of keys in consecutive rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will provide a way for the TVF caller to indicate desired semantics for dividing up the rows of the input table into partitions for consumption by the underlying algorithm.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test coverage and also end-to-end tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR reinstates `Row.jsonValue`, `Row.prettyJson` & `Row.json`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Row.jsonValue` and other json rendering is used in a couple of hard to remove places and there are also a couple of users using it. In order to support this we needed to move quite a few date time related classes.  We were going to move them anyway because they are also needed to decouple direct arrow encoding from catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`null IN (empty list)` incorrectly evaluates to null, when it should evaluate to false. (The reason it should be false is because a IN (b1, b2) is defined as a = b1 OR a = b2, and an empty IN list is treated as an empty OR which is false. This is specified by ANSI SQL.)\r\n\r\nMany places in Spark execution (In, InSet, InSubquery) and optimization (OptimizeIn, NullPropagation) implemented this wrong behavior. This is a longstanding correctness issue which has existed since null support for IN expressions was first added to Spark.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes Spark execution (In, InSet, InSubquery). See previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42007 for optimization fixes.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is under a flag, which will be available to revert to the legacy behavior if needed. This flag is set to disable the new behavior until all of the fix PRs are complete.\r\n\r\nSee [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k8AY8oyT-GI04SnP7eXttPDnDj-Ek-c3luF2zL6DPNU/edit) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix wrong SQL semantics\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNot yet, but will fix wrong SQL semantics when

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for pandas-on-Spark DataFrame for the testing util, `assertDataFrameEqual`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change allows users to call the same PySpark API, `assertDataFrameEqual`, for both Spark and pandas-on-Spark DataFrames. It also exposes a new user-facing API, `assertPandasOnSparkEqual`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR affects the user-facing util `assertDataFrameEqual` and exposes a new user-facing API, `assertPandasOnSparkEqual`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_utils.py` and `python/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/test_utils.py` and existing pandas util tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-25T21:20:54Z","updated_at":"2023-07-28T14:57:56Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T05:42:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a84c3da4c3153134fa29a666cc35a0e1402427c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

One method used for configuring python's arrow runner has been moved to ArrowPythonRunner .\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nArrowUtils is used by connect's direct Arrow encoding (and a lot of other things in sql). We want to remove the connect scala client's catalyst dependency. We need to move ArrowUtil in order to do so.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting
