What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR continues the discussion and implementation in [PR-2978](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2978) which had to be closed earlier.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents the total loss of configuration information that happens when zeppelin attempts to write out modified configuration information into an already full file-system. The approach taken here is to first write the modified information to a temporary file (in the same directory), and then to rename the successfully written file to its eventual name.\r\n\r\nThe rename operation is not attempted if there is an error while writing the temporary file, thus leaving the pre-existing configuration file untouched.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3467\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCI Pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrent implementation of autocomplete allows only completion in `schema.table.column` scenario. Such scenario exclude tables for default schema.\r\nThe PR fixes the scenario with tables in default schema and alias processing.\r\nAlso I want to add feature to complete columns for used tables in statement from blank cursor.\r\n\r\nThe autocomplete was tested for Greenplum 4.3 (PostgreSQL), Oracle 11g, MySQL (Hive Metastore) and Hive.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3379\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Manually\r\n* Tests pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the interpolation of ZeppelinContext objects into the paragraph text of BigQuery cells. It also introduces a new interpreter-level configuration parameter named zeppelin.bigquery.interpolation. This new parameter is false by default, and must be set to true to enable object interpolation. The default value of false guarantees backward compatibility for users who are not aware of the new feature.\r\n\r\nThe implementation takes the same approach that was followed in PR [2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898) and [2903](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2903).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3438\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nTwo new unit test classes have been added: [BigQueryInterpolationDefaultTest.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...sanjaydasgupta:zeppelin-3438-z-variables-for-bigquery?expand=1#diff-d3e3900a3a067da0f1c9863b026c13c7), and [BigQueryInterpolationEnabledTest.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...sanjaydasgupta:zeppelin-3438-z-variables-for-bigquery?expand=1#diff-a590dc5b78e2eae05ab5c7bda8dcc028).\r\n\r\nAlso, the code in this PR merely causes the BigQuery interpreter to \"opt-in\" to the implementation already existing in the Interpreter base class - described in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898). The unit tests necessary are already present in PR-2898\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

### What is this PR for?\r\nCurrent merge_zeppelin_pr.py shebang has user env dependent.\r\nWhich means python version would be different from each user's environment.\r\n\r\nHowever this script is unavailable with python 3.\r\nTherefore I think it needs to be fixed with available python version.\r\n\r\n ### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug]\r\n\r\n ### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3429\r\n\r\n ### How should this be tested?\r\nRun merge_zeppelin_pr.py on the system using default python version 3.\r\n\r\n ### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-25T08:23:01Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T22:15:43Z","closed_at":"2018-04-25T22:15:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74dfdd51186e809495efb73c81a358cd011c87a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/3c30ba62f05834562df6f9db6520c3d6b42d7da1","head":{"label":"jwagun:ZEPPELIN-3429","ref":"ZEPPELIN-3429","sha":"3c30ba62f05834562df6f9db6520c3d6b42d7da1","user":{"login":"jwagun","id":1886137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODYxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1886137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119796458,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3OTY0NTg=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"jwagun/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagun","id":1886137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODYxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1886137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagun/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR introduces a new configuration property to convert username to lower case. This is useful when the users (from external sources like AD/LDAP) are coming in with mixed-case names and Hadoop services (like Hive) can't authorize them correctly because Hadoop services recognize users only in lower case (like Linux). \r\n\r\nAdding a new config option \"zeppelin.username.force.lowercase\" to handle such scenarios.\r\n\r\nBehavior without this PR:\r\nAccess is denied to CaMel case user while running a Hive paragraph\r\n\r\nBehavior with this PR:\r\nUser is allowed to run query when proposed configuration set to true.\r\nBy default, keeping zeppelin.username.force.lowercase=false to retain the current behavior.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Unit test\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3312\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Travis CI should pass\r\n* Manual steps to test:\r\n1. Configure Zeppelin with Active Directory authentication\r\n2. Login to Zeppelin as a CaMel case user\r\n3. Try to run a simple JDBC note with a Hive query (like a select * query). This would fail with \"user [CaMel] does not have proper privileges to [USE] operation\" error message.\r\n4. Now set zeppelin.username.force.lowercase=true in custom zeppelin-site.xml configuration.\r\n5. Once again, login as CaMel case user. This time the same Hive query would run as expected. Because the username is now passed in lower case.\r\n6. Also notice that after successful login, the login username (in the top-right corner) will be in lower case too.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n* Login as CaMel case user:\r\n<img width=\"596\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-12 at 3 33 01 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15668387/38672744-faf00f8e-3e03-11e8-86b2-cc5981d380d2.png\">\r\n* Notice the converted username post login:\r\n<img width=\"806\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-12 at 3 33 43 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15668387/38672777-108c7b66-3e04-11e8-8c97-467b4b73fe3d.png\">\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen I run all of the tests zeppelin-zengine in IntelliJ, the tests in ShellScriptLauncherTest and SparkInterpreterLaunchTest fail, but if I run these tests by themselves, they pass.\r\nThere is a problem with the tests in ShellScripterLauncherTest and SparkInterpreterLaunchTest, which is that if some of the ConfVars are set (such as ZEPPELIN_HOME) in other tests, then these tests will fail, because they expect that these variables are not set. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, I have added a setUp() method that clears all of the ConfVars to both ShellScripterLauncherTest and
