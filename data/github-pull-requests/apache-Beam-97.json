add a meaningful description for your change here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15951 was the original trigger. During my tests the issue that I have encountered was that the graph and the behaviour during the actual execution differed from the one I would have expected strictly based on the `KafkaIO` configurations in the code. It happened due to multiple reasons, but this PR only aims to address one - for the rest see https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16773 and https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16888\r\n\r\nSo the current issue is that not every configration/property available at at the `KafkaIO.Read` works both with the legacy and the SDF implementation. On it's own this wouldn't be a problem, but unfortunately not every property was checked for this so you could configure it thinking it will work, but it won't and to make things ever worse without providing you any notice/warning about it. Also in certain scenarios the internal `PTransform` overrides replaced a working solution with another one that could result in lost functionality, because the new one might not support a feature - and to make this even worse this codepath could completely avoid any check in that regard.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

functionality for running jars to the Go integration test framework, and uses this functionality to implement handling of K:V flags for providing expansion service jars and addresses to the test framework. This means that tests can simply get the address of an expansion service with the appropriate label, and this feature will handle running a jar if necessary, or just using the passed in endpoint otherwise.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, we don't have a well defined automated system for staying on top of pull request reviews - we rely on contributors being able to find the correct OWNERS file and committers manually triaging/calling attention to old pull requests. This is the start of an effort to improve our automation around this. [Design doc for the full effort here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FhRPRD6VXkYlLAPhNfZB7y2Yese2FCWBzjx67d3TjBo/edit#)\r\n\r\nI have the code to handle new prs and pr updates in a repo here - https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo - this is a subset of the [full set of changes](https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/1) split up to try to keep reviews manageable. This Pr introduces most of the shared files used by the automations for things like interacting with GitHub, storing/interacting with our durable state on a dedicated branch and configuration, and some constants used by the automations.\r\n\r\nInitially, I am filtering all bot activity prs with the Go label. This is to minimize the blast radius of the automation in case it doesn't work perfectly out the gate or we find it unhelpful. Eventually, I plan on expanding to the rest of the repo.\r\n\r\nYou can see see the completed portions of the bot in action in [this pr](https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/3) and [this pr](https://github.com/damccorm/beam-pr-bot-demo/pull/4) (they show different use cases and exercise almost all of the behavior of the bot).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nSee the [Contributor Guide](https://beam.apache.org/contribute) for more tips on [how to make review process

prepares ClientConfiguration for Json serialization to be used in PipelineOptions (as preparation for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13956).\r\n\r\nRemoving`SerializableAwsCredentialsProvider` and handling by explicit serialization/deserialisation in ClientConfiguration makes this a bit easier.\r\n\r\nAdditionally cleanup the AwsModule for Json serialization as it grows quickly:\r\n- Use Annotations where possible instead of writing custom Serializers / Deserializers\r\n- Move Annotations to internal classes where possible rather than having Mixin (and move respective tests accordingly)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15951 was the original trigger: basically the `DataflowRunner` replaced my SDF-based `withStopReadTime` configured `KafkaIO.Read` with a legacy read that completely lacked support for that configuration.\r\n\r\nIMO there was two way to fix this. Either make the replacement \"smart\" to avoid doing it/fail-fast if it would mean a lost functionality, or completely get rid of the responsible `PTransformOverride`. So I started digging why is it needed, and why is it there. I might be missing something, but hear me out.\r\n\r\n**2021-04-13**\r\nSo `KafkaIO.Read.KAFKA_READ_OVERRIDE` was introduced to multiple runners in https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/f2cc92663ad8ae685183e076cdb652d8fc3ba4e0 - the reasons aren't completely clear for me, and looking at the current code I'm even more baffled, but lets keep going.\r\n\r\n**2021-05-19**\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/commit/99b1a926decaf372e763ea409e1d42703dda59c8 removed the `KafkaIO.Read.KAFKA_READ_OVERRIDE` from various Spark runners and instead added experiments to \"*Populate experiments directly to have Kafka use legacy read.*\". This seems logical to me, although - yet again - I have no idea why `DataflowRunner` wasn't touched.\r\n\r\n**2021-05-20**\r\nWe arrived at https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/c097d8424678813901ac46f2fe674cfe71e67430 which again did some changes in the previously already modified runners. Instead of having the code responsible for the replacement in every runner, it was moved to `KafkaIO`. Yet again `DataflowRunner` was still excluded, but it had a reason now: \"*Only Dataflow runner requires sdf read at this moment. For other non-portable runners, if it doesn't specify use_sdf_read, it will use legacy read regarding to performance concern.*\"\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nSo assuming the comment from the last commit - which is still there verbatim even today - is accurate what this tells me at this point is, that with `DataflowRunner` it's not only **supported**, but actually **preferred/required** to have SDF read.\r\n\r\nAlso the comment introduced in the first commit for the `KafkaIO.Read.KAFKA_READ_OVERRIDE` is also still there and unchanged, saying: \"*A `PTransformOverride` for runners to swap `ReadFromKafkaViaSDF` to legacy Kafka read if runners doesn't have a good support on executing unbounded Splittable DoFn.*\" What this tells me that it should be used for runners **not supporting** SDF read.\r\n\r\nBased on these two statements I would say it's safe to say `DataflowRunner` should **NOT** have it **AT ALL**. This PR intends to solve this problem. If you know a scenario when it's actually required I'm okay with modifying the replacement to replace it only in special scenarios, but right now I couldn't find any that would require something like that.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ability to mix and match runners and SDKs is accomplished through two portability layers:\r\n1. The Runner API provides an SDK-and-runner-independent definition of a Beam pipeline\r\n2. The Fn API allows a runner to invoke SDK-specific user-defined functions\r\n\r\nApache Beam pipelines support executing stateful DoFns[1]. To support this execution the Runner API defines multiple user state specifications:\r\n* ReadModifyWriteStateSpec\r\n* BagStateSpec\r\n* OrderedListStateSpec\r\n* CombiningStateSpec\r\n* MapStateSpec\r\n* SetStateSpec\r\n\r\nThe Fn API[2] defines APIs[3] to get, append and clear user state currently supporting a BagUserState and MultimapUserState protocol.\r\n\r\nSince there is no clear mapping between the Runner API and Fn API state specifications, there is no way for a runner to know that it supports a given API necessary to support the execution of the pipeline. The Runner will also have to manage additional runtime metadata associated with which protocol was used for a type of state so that it can successfully manage the state’s lifetime once it can be garbage collected.\r\n\r\nPlease see the doc[4] for further details and a proposal on how to address this shortcoming.\r\n\r\n1: https://beam.apache.org/blog/stateful-processing/\r\n2: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/3ad05523f4cdf5122fc319276fcb461f768af39d/model/fn-execution/src/main/proto/beam_fn_api.proto#L742\r\n3: https://s.apache.org/beam-fn-state-api-and-bundle-processing\r\n4: http://doc/1ELKTuRTV3C5jt_YoBBwPdsPa5eoXCCOSKQ3GPzZrK7Q\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

precision is used by Spanner to track change streams, for which we are adding support here. Previously we only supported microsecond precision.\r\n\r\nImplements a timestamp restriction tracker based on the offsetrange tracker to claim timestamps. This was necessary, because the precision can not be represented through a long (with the OffsetRangeTracker).\r\n\r\nOn top of new TimestampRangeTracker, we built two decorator restriction trackers for each of our SDFs, which behave slightly differently.\r\n\r\nThe DetectNewPartitionsTracker allows for claiming timestamps equal to or greater than the current restriction timestamp.\r\n\r\nThe ReadChangeStreamPartitionTracker does the same as the above, but it disallows for splitting when the initial (fake) partition is being queried. We do not want to split at that case, because there is no way to resume from where we left off specifically for the initial change stream query.\r\n\r\nThis commit also modifies the relevant tests.","created_at":"2022-02-14T04:12:23Z","updated_at":"2022-03-09T22:47:24Z","closed_at":"2022-03-09T21:26:24Z","merged_at":"2022-03-09T21:26:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d1b02311d413151112fa5c0db30cf372c088f84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1839326366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM5MzI2MzY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/build","name":"build","color":"cf8af7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/16844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/16844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/16844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/e911f7fee3861f3805544c493eb978652eb04852","head":{"label":"thiagotnunes:spannerio-nanosecond-precision","ref":"spannerio-nanosecond-precision","sha":"e911f7fee3861f3805544c493eb978652eb04852","user":{"login":"thiagotnunes","id":302813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes","html_url":"https://github.com/thiagotnunes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"45cc2f822901eb444f7a4b40aaf1d90158cf5f04","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache

ability to mix and match runners and SDKs is accomplished through two portability layers:\r\n1. The Runner API provides an SDK-and-runner-independent definition of a Beam pipeline\r\n2. The Fn API allows a runner to invoke SDK-specific user-defined functions\r\n\r\nApache Beam pipelines support executing stateful DoFns[1]. To support this execution the Runner API defines multiple user state specifications:\r\n* ReadModifyWriteStateSpec\r\n* BagStateSpec\r\n* OrderedListStateSpec\r\n* CombiningStateSpec\r\n* MapStateSpec\r\n* SetStateSpec\r\n\r\nThe Fn API[2] defines APIs[3] to get, append and clear user state currently supporting a BagUserState and MultimapUserState protocol.\r\n\r\nSince there is no clear mapping between the Runner API and Fn API state specifications, there is no way for a runner to know that it supports a given API necessary to support the execution of the pipeline. The Runner will also have to manage additional runtime metadata associated with which protocol was used for a type of state so that it can successfully manage the state’s lifetime once it can be garbage collected.\r\n\r\nPlease see the doc[4] for further details and a proposal on how to address this shortcoming.\r\n\r\n1: https://beam.apache.org/blog/stateful-processing/\r\n2: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/3ad05523f4cdf5122fc319276fcb461f768af39d/model/fn-execution/src/main/proto/beam_fn_api.proto#L742\r\n3: https://s.apache.org/beam-fn-state-api-and-bundle-processing\r\n4: http://doc/1ELKTuRTV3C5jt_YoBBwPdsPa5eoXCCOSKQ3GPzZrK7Q\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Jenkins at the moment because it only works on Dataflow and there currently isn't a test suite that runs Go xlang transforms on Dataflow.
