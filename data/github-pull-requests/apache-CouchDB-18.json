the environment VM_ARGS with ARGS_FILE, which is the same name and set the same manner as the couchdb script; \r\n\r\nThe new script also parses name from the same file.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe current remsh script required you specify the name and cookie if they differ from the system default. The new script synchronizes the setting of ARGS_FILE with that environment in the couchdb startup script. This now also, like the couchdb startup script, respects any COUCHDB_ARGS_FILE override.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI changed the COUCHDB_ARGS_FILE environment variable and reran rmsh it and saw that it picked up non-default name and cookie.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis answers (the linux) part of #2176\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nIn CouchDB 4.0, directories and indirection access in FoundationDB are already used to better build data model. One key/value pair is used to build reference from Dbkey to DbPrefix. All other key/value pairs are based on DbPrefix instead of DbKey. This decouples the direct relationship between DBName and data in this database. The current implementation for `DBKey -> DBPrefix` is `{?ALL_DBS, DbName} -> {?DBS, DbName}`. So you can see below information in FoundationDB using fdbcli, etc.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{?ALL_DBS, DbName} -> {?DBS, DbName}\r\n{?DBS, DbName, other part of key} -> <value>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo support soft-deletion, especially allowing one database to be deleted/re-created multiple time, we need to use different DbPrefix for the same DbKey/DBName. The proposed change is to use a unique value allocated via High Contention Allocator(HCA) algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    DbPrefixAllocator = erlfdb_hca:create(?ERLFDB_EXTEND(DbId, <<\"hca\">>)),,\r\n    DbPrefix = erlfdb_hca:allocate(DBPrefixAllocator, Tx),\r\n    erlfdb:set(Tx, DbKey, DbPrefix),\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe data in FoundationDB looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{?ALL_DBS, DbName} -> <unique key allocated by hca>\r\n{<unique key allocated by hca>, other part of key} -> <value>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing HCA algorithm, it can acquire one unique key quickly while avoiding conflicting. The more important, it is shorter enough to save space because `DBPrefix` exists in almost every key/value pair for database. \r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nAll existing CURD test case for database should pass.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP to add the `_info` endpoint for views stored in fdb. Currently, I am unsure of the backwards compatibility for some of the fields returned by traditional couchdb views.\r\n\r\nInfo can be divided into 3 categories: \r\n\r\n1) Status of the build - In traditional views, we looked at\r\n    **a) the update seq of the view**\r\n    b) committed seq\r\n    c) number of clients waiting to commit\r\n    d) number of clients waiting\r\n    e) if the indexer is still running\r\n\r\nWe can determine **a)** by calling `couch_views_fdb:get_update_seq/2` (note it's a binary instead of couch_mrview's `update_seq` values which are integers).  In traditional views, **b)-d)** refers the number of workers in a queue that are waiting to start indexing and then committing. I'm not sure how this transfers over to fdb as workers are part of the couch_jobs framework and commits occur for very transaction. For e), I looked at `couch_jobs` to see if crafting the `job_id` can give us the state of the job (confirmed with @nickva )\r\n\r\n2) Size of the Index - Disk size does not seem applicable. For data size, `couch_view` has a `couch_views_fdb:get_kv_size/2` function for each view built. I don't think the subcategories of size are applicable either: `file`, `external`, `active`. \r\n\r\nCompaction - Not Applicable.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAdded a new `_info` endpoint test.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of the work in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2672 to fix issues around secondary shard creation when nodes re-enter a cluster after a database was created while the node was down (or potentially in maintenance mode).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces logic to handle the following four scenarios while opening a db in context of `fabric_rpc` and `mem3_rpc`:\r\n\r\n  1) the db already exists\r\n    - just return the db as normal\r\n  2) the db does not exist locally, but the dbs db doc with db create options is present\r\n    - load the db create options and create the local shard\r\n  3) the db does not exist locally but it's not a sharded database\r\n    - just create the local db as expected\r\n  4) the db does not exist locally, it's a sharded database, and the dbs db doc is not present\r\n    - throw an error and prevent creating the db with incomplete settings\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of scenario 2) by loading the appropriate config and creating the db with the desired parameters, and of scenario 4) by no longer allowing the db to be created inappropriately.\r\n\r\nFor scenario three, I've taken the approach of not loading config as a non sharded db won't have a dbs db doc. In particular here, we want to properly handle updates to internal dbs like `_dbs` and also `sys_dbs` like `_users`.\r\n\r\nAnother open item here is the merging of the db create options and the provided options. Right now, I'm just doing `DbOpts ++ Opts` basically, but I wrote a functions `opts_merge/{2,3}` that will merge two proplists, prioritizing the first list of items, and supports atoms. It's... a bit gnarly, and I'm not convinced we should use it. So we need to figure out what to do with the options lists here, but I _think_ we might be ok just combining the two.\r\n\r\nWhile in the general neighborhood, I took the opportunity to de-duplicate some of the shards_db config lookups as well. I've isolated those changes to a dedicated commit.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis needs more testing. I've got a WIP commit for adding a test suite here that is not yet complete. I figured it was worthwhile to get this PR out for feedback while continuing to work on the tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option for enabling encryption for primary data. The encryption done with aes-256-gcm algorithm per document with document keys (Data Encryption Keys) derived from an individual database's key (Key Encryption Key). KEK supplied at time of the database creation and stored along with the rest of its configuration in encrypted \"wrapped\" form.\r\n\r\nThe encoding and decoding of documents handled in a dedicated module that also acts as a cache of \"unwrapped\" KEKs. The general management of KEKs implemented through epi plugin interface to allow a possibility for implementation of interfaces to alternative Key Management Services, e.g. Hashicorps Vault or SecretHub.\r\n\r\nThe default epi plugin generates KEK at a databae creation time and encrypts it with a Master Encryption Key specified in CouchDB configuration.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nMake target `make check-fdb` should

modifies the exlixir target with a new config option in the dev/run script\r\nThis PR updates Makefile.win with the same change\r\n\r\nAs a side effect of #2660 the test CouchDB config may change between test targets (elixir, javascript) but devclean target didn't clean the etc folder and the execution order can produce errors. \r\n\r\nRunning `make elixir` and then `make javascript` fails\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nSorry,  I don't have a Windows machine to test this...\r\n\r\n`make elixir` must work in Windows\r\n\r\nThe following sequence must work\r\n```\r\n make elixir\r\n make javascript\r\n```\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in

Overview\r\n\r\nWe've seen a crash if DbPartitioned is false and ViewPartitioned is\r\ntrue, which is obviously nonsense. The effect of the `nocase` is the\r\ntermination of the couch_index_server gen_server, which is a serious\r\namplification of a small (user-initiated) oddity.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nDifficult to induce. The protection that prevents us creating a ddoc with partitioned:true if the\r\ndb is partitioned:false must have a gap (perhaps ?new_edits=false / replicator path?)\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview \r\n\r\n`list_dbs_info/3` maintains a queue of up to 100 futures which are used to\r\nconcurrently fetch data. Previously, if the transaction was reset, and the\r\naccumulator inside the fold may have had futures from a previous transaction,\r\nwhich have gotten their results yet, they threw a transaction_canceled (1025)\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, if we're in a read-only transaction, we return the tx object in\r\nthe opaque db info record. Then, if `erlfdb:wait/1` throws a transaction\r\ncanceled error, we re-fetch the future from the now restarted transaction.\r\n\r\nPotentially, the transaction may also time-out while the futures queues is\r\ndrained after the main range fold has finished already. Handle that case by\r\nreseting the transaction and then re-fetching the futures. To avoid an infinite\r\nloop we allow up to 2 retries only.\r\n\r\nThis approach is not the most optimal but simpler as it hides the complexity\r\ninside the fabric2_fdb module where we already handle these conditions. It\r\nmeans that every 5 or so seconds we might have to refetch less than 100 extra\r\nfutures from the queue (as some or all may have gotten their results back\r\nalready).\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake check-fdb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen check coverage in fabric2_fdb with `open

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nInstead of automatically and immediately removing data and index in database after a delete operation, soft-deletion allows to restore the deleted data back to original state due to a “fat finger”or undesired delete operation, up to defined periods, such as 48 hours.\r\n\r\nIn CouchDB 3.0, soft-deletion of database is implemented in [1]. The .couch file is renamed with the .<timestamp>.deleted.couch file after soft-deletion is enabled, and such file can be changed back to .couch for the purpose of restore. If restore is not needed and some specified period passed, the .<timestamp>.deleted.couch file can be deleted to achieve deletion of database permanently.\r\n\r\nIn CouchDB 4.0, with the introduction of FoundationDB, the data model and storage is changed. In order to support soft-deletion, we propose below solution and then implement them.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nmake check skip_deps+=couch_epi apps=fabric tests=crud_test_\r\n```\r\n======================== EUnit ========================\r\nTest

There was a good amount of duplication between `_db_crud_tests` and\r\n `_changes_fold_tests`, so make a common test utility module so both suites can\r\n use.\r\n\r\n* Clean up test names.

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation uses global configuration option to determine the batch size for a background index build. This approach is sub-optimal because it is not taking the design doc write amplification factors into account. The amount of writes and therefore transaction time depends on multiple factors, such as:\r\n\r\n* complexity of JavaScript function\r\n* size of the document\r\n* number of indexes\r\n* number of emits from JavaScript function\r\n\r\nThis makes every database unique. Which requires independent control of a batch size. The idea is to implement a feedback control algorithm (rate limiter) to control batch size and delay between batches.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake couch && ERL_LIBS=`pwd`/src EXUNIT_DEBUG=true mix test --trace src/couch_rate/test/exunit/\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_eval,couch_expiring_cache,ctrace,couch_jobs,couch_views,fabric\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Simulation results\r\n\r\nThe test suite uses time simulation to get performance results without waiting forever. This statistics can be enabled using the following:\r\n```\r\nmake couch && ERL_LIBS=`pwd`/src EXUNIT_DEBUG=true mix test --trace src/couch_rate/test/exunit/couch_rate_limiter_test.exs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-13T21:13:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T18:01:34Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T10:43:36Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T10:43:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"d520d7331706315968f918c0985e8341c62246e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/85f81d88018fe526f1f216d673a9bbc847cbd81c","head":{"label":"cloudant:couch_view-rate_limit","ref":"couch_view-rate_limit","sha":"85f81d88018fe526f1f216d673a9bbc847cbd81c","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\n👋 Hello! This PR is introduces support for JWT authentication in CouchDB.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115199/76270696-1d792c00-6244-11ea-9eba-fe67b78cb426.png)\r\n\r\nBefore any details, I would like to give a big thank-you to @rnewson for his guidance and help. He's been a great ambassador! 👏\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nI'm starting out with the familiar scenario of a JavaScript application using PouchDB that I wish to sync to CouchDB.\r\nWhat's different is that my JS application performs authentication against an OpenID Connect/Oauth2 server that is not running on CouchDB.  Think Auth0, Azure AD B2C, OpenIddict Core, etc...\r\n\r\nAt present, in order to authenticate with CouchDB from clients that are already performing authentication outside of the CouchDB server, I am forced to consider one-off workarounds, all while a de-facto standard already exists for the notion of a portable and stateless identity: JWT.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that this implementation weighed against the complexity and less deliberate nature of any one workaround makes a good case for itself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAfter enabling the authorization handler and setting a matching JWT secret in your couchdb ini file, you should be able to authenticate to CouchDB using an HTTP `Authorization: Bearer [token]` header.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation\r\n\r\n## Meta\r\n\r\nI'm relatively new to Erlang but am interested enough to get this through review.  I've tried to keep my changes as additive as possible however if any refactors or structural work ends up being required, I may need detailed guidance.\r\n\r\nFinally, I feel this functionality would be valuable not just for my own personal use, but for future users considering CouchDB for their own mixed ecosystems. Many cloud vendors offer HTTP-centric API gateways and auth* endpoints which are a good match for CouchDB.\r\n\r\nNot that I want to sound too product-y, but I think having JWT support built in would

a simple index auto-updater\r\n\r\nThe main logic is as follows:\r\n\r\n - After doc update transaction(s) are completed in the `fabric2_db` module,\r\n   call the `fabric2_index:db_updated(Db)` function.\r\n\r\n - `fabric2_index:db_updated(Db)` inserts a `{DbName, Timestamp}` tuple into\r\n   one of the sharded ets tables. The tuple is inserted using `ets:insert_new`,\r\n   which ensures only the first entry succeeds and others will be ignored,\r\n   until that entry is cleared.\r\n\r\n - Each ets table in `fabric2_index` has a simple monitor process that\r\n   periodically scans that table. If it finds databases which have been\r\n   updated, it notifies all the indices which have registered with\r\n   `fabric2_index` to build indices.\r\n\r\nIndex auto-building is enabled for couch_views application in a separate commit.\r\n\r\nThen there is another commit to optimize `couch_jobs` a bit when a job may be \r\nre-submitted repeatedly while it's in the `pending` state.

Overview\r\n\r\nClean up view size limit enforcement\r\n\r\nBoth a performance and style cleanup. This reduces the number of ets\r\ncalls by roughly `2 * 2 * $num_docs * $num_views`. The first factor of\r\ntwo is because this avoids re-calculating the size twice for both the id\r\nand map indexes. The second factor of two is because we have to lookup\r\ntwo different settings.\r\n\r\nStylistically this also moves the logic out of the fdb modules. Keeping\r\nkey/value structure and update logic is already pretty complicated so we\r\nshould avoid mixing external application logic into those modules as\r\nmuch as possible for our sanity.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is slightly changed vs the original patch as well.\r\nOriginally only the view that contained the errant key or value was\r\naffected. However, pre-existing behavior where a document fails to be\r\nmapped correctly resulted in it being excluded from all view indexes\r\ndefined in the design document. That behavior has been restored.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nmake check-fdb\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n-

Overview\r\n\r\nThere are cases where sensitive data can leak into a log file. This PR makes a first stab at the problem. The sensitive data can end up in the log when process implementing `gen_server` or `gen_event` behavior crashes. The erlang implementation of a `gen_server` support a `format_status/2` callback to remove sensitive data from `state` term. However the last message (`LastMsg`) recveived by the process is still logged. In order to solve this problem this PR modifies `couch_log_formatter` to remove `LastMsg` in case when formatted state is a tupple with arity 2 and second element of a tuple is map containing `sensitive` key with value `true`. This allows us to remove sensitive information from both `LastMsg` and `State` via `format_status/2` callback. Here is an example:\r\n```\r\nformat_status(_Opt, [_PDict, State]) ->\r\n    #state{\r\n        url = Url,\r\n        proxy_url = ProxyURL,\r\n        limit = Limit\r\n    } = State,\r\n    {[\r\n        {url, couch_util:url_strip_password(Url)},\r\n        {proxy_url, ProxyURL},\r\n        {limit, Limit}\r\n    ], #{sensitive => true}}.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1.

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously concurrent db creation requests could get past `db_exists/1` and try\r\nto create the db shard document. The first one would succeed but others could\r\nfail with a `500 {\"error\":\"error\", \"reason\":\"conflict\"}` error instead of `412`.\r\n\r\nHandle the race condition by checking if db exists after getting a conflict\r\nerror and return a 412 response.\r\n\r\nFixes: #2613\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=fabric suites=fabric_db_create_tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo verify the validity of the test can comment out the `{error, conflict}` clause and it should fail in the `?assertEqual` line with a `conflict error` instead of `file_exists`\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by
