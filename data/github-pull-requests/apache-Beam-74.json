Instead, also ensure those types are registered with the Iter and Emitter* methods.\r\n\r\nAlso moves the iterator and emitter tests to co-aligned files, to make them easier to find.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`connectors`.\r\n- Drop links to the old page, or redirect them to the new page as appropriate. \r\n- Add links to the I/O Connectors guides (`built-in` had this, but `connectors` did

true.\r\n\r\nThis is because zip() drops the trailing columns from the row that has more columns.

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed.

(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>feat: add host param to url function for wait.ForSQL (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/524\">#524</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/frozenbonito\"><code>@​frozenbonito</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before this change, when waiting for a SQL to be executed in a container it always checked against <code>localhost</code>, but it could be the case that the database instance runs in a different container. For that reason, the library now supports passing the host where the database is running so that the <code>wait.ForSQL</code> function needs the host as part of the input parameters.</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code>- func ForSQL(port nat.Port, driver string, url func(nat.Port) string) *waitForSql {\n+ func ForSQL(port nat.Port, driver string, url func(host string, port nat.Port) string)

contains logic to convert a BQ Schema into a Beam Schema, but it seems like there's an issue with the new Beam release in calling the `bigquery_schema_tools.py` file.

contains logic to convert a BQ Schema into a Beam Schema, but it seems like there's an issue with the new Beam release in calling the `bigquery_schema_tools.py` file. This PR fixes that. Note that this issue was highlited in my local IDE, but still compiled anyway and didn't get caught in our testing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23760\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`--release 8` ensures the compilation uses the JDK 8 versions of APIs.\r\n\r\nFor example, `java.nio.ByteBuffer` added an override of `clear()` in JDK 9. Compiling on JDK 9 or newer and\r\ntargeting Java 8, without also setting `--release` (or `-bootclasspath`), will result in references to the new method\r\nwhich will then fail at runtime with a `NoSuchMethodError`.\r\n\r\nThis change also updates some version detection to use the target language level of the build\r\n(`JavaVersion.toVersion(project.javaVersion)`) instead of the JVM version the build is using\r\n(`JavaVersion.current()`).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds a TensorFlow object detection example using the MobileNet v2 320x320 [model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) and the [TensorFlow RunInference API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx-bsl/blob/master/tfx_bsl/public/beam/run_inference.py). This is the same model that is used in the TensorRT object detection example using [TensorRTRunInference API](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/ml/inference/tensorrt_inference.py).\r\n\r\nThe goal is to be able to benchmark both implementations on DataFlow. I've added a larger dataset `gs://apache-beam-ml/testing/inputs/coco_train_inputs.txt` that contains 118287 examples.\r\n\r\nCurrent status: I am running into an issue with signature dtypes.
