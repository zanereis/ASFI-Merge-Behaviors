The later doesnâ€™t take a `TaskContext`. We shall make the function signature the same to avoid confusion and misusage.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the following API changes:\r\n- In `RDDBarrier`, migrate `mapPartitions` from\r\n   ```\r\n

method is only transferring a ManagedBuffer to the caller,\r\nso there is no reason why it should allocate 2 (!) intermediate data\r\nbuffers in order to do so.\r\n\r\nIn this commit I'm removing the conversion from any kind of managed buffer\r\nbesides FileSegment to a NioManagedBuffer.\r\nHowever if you check the only calling method getRemoteBytes(), you will\r\nsee that here we either:\r\n - do a memory-map if we have a FileSegmentManagedBuffer\r\n - try again to call the nioByteBuffer() method otherwise\r\n\r\nSo in any case the conversion will occur later.\r\n\r\n## What changes were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `SparkHadoopUtil. checkAccessPermission`,  we consider only basic permissions in order to check whether a user can access a file or not. This is not a complete check, as it ignores ACLs and other policies a file system may apply in its internal. So this can result in returning wrongly that a user cannot access a file (despite he actually can).\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to delegate to the filesystem the check whether a file is accessible or not, in order to return the right result. A caching layer is added for performance reasons.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `SparkHadoopUtil. checkAccessPermission`,  we consider only basic permissions in order to check whether a user can access a file or not. This is not a complete check, as it ignores ACLs and other policies a file system may apply in its internal. So this can result in returning wrongly that a user cannot access a file (despite he actually can).\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to delegate to the filesystem the check whether a file is accessible or not, in order to return the right result. A caching layer is added for performance reasons.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to treat empty strings for double and float types as `null` consistently. Looks we mistakenly missed this corner case, which I guess is not that serious since this looks happened betwen 1.x and 2.x, and pretty corner case.\r\n\r\nFor an easy reproducer, in case of double, the code below raises an error:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"mode\", \"FAILFAST\").json(Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\":\"\", \"b\": \"\"}\"\"\", \"\"\"{\"a\": 1.1, \"b\": 1.1}\"\"\").toDS).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot parse  as double.\r\n  at

details please refer to\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25038\r\n\r\nWhen Spark SQL read large amount of data, it take a long time (more than 10 minutes) to generate physical Plan and then ActiveJob because sequentially get block location is very time-consuming. \r\n\r\nTo improve this, ParArray can be used to get block location in parallel\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nThere is a table which is partitioned by date and hour. There are more than 13 TB data each hour and 185 TB per day. When we just issue a very simple SQL, it take a long time to generate ActiveJob\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe SQL statement is\r\n\r\nselect count(device_id) from test_tbl where date=20180731 and hour='21';\r\n \r\n\r\nBefore optimization, it takes 2 minutes and 9 seconds to generate the Job\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe SQL is issued at 2018-08-07 09:07:41\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the job is submitted at 2018-08-07 09:09:53, which is 2minutes and 9 seconds later than the SQL issue time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter the optimization, it takes only 4 seconds to generate the Job\r\n\r\nThe SQL is issued at 2018-08-07 09:20:15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd the job is submitted at 2018-08-07 09:20:19, which is 4 seconds later than the SQL issue time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the executors acquired using dynamic allocation are not released when the cached RDD is unpersisted. This leads to wasting unnecessary grid resources. With this change, once the cached RDD is unpersisted, we check if the executor has any running tasks or not. If not then we do the following:\r\n1 - If the executor has cached RDD blocks from other RDDs, we don't make any change.\r\n2 - If the executor has no more cached RDD blocks and tasks running, we update the removal time based on the conf `spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout` so the idle executor can be released back. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually using a code snippet. \r\n``` scala\r\nval rdd = sc.textFile(\"smallFile\")\r\nrdd.cache\r\n\r\nval rdd2 = sc.textFile(\"largeFile\")\r\nrdd2.cache\r\n\r\nrdd2.count // Cached data on around 500+ executors\r\nThread.sleep(30000) // sleep for 30s\r\nrdd.count // Cached data on around 20 executors\r\n\r\n// Verify only 20 executors remain, rest will timeout based on idleTimeout which i set to 60s\r\nrdd2.unpersist \r\n\r\n// eventunally  all executors will be released as there are no tasks running on any

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR add python support for barrier execution mode, thus enable launch a job containing barrier stage(s) from PySpark.\r\n\r\nWe just forked the existing `RDDBarrier` and `RDD.barrier()` in Python api.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n```\r\n>>> rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4])\r\n>>> def f(iterator): yield sum(iterator)\r\n... \r\n>>> rdd.barrier().mapPartitions(f).isBarrier() == True\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnit tests will be added in a follow-up PR that implements BarrierTaskContext on python side.","created_at":"2018-08-06T18:09:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-11T13:48:53Z","closed_at":"2018-08-11T13:48:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"62608681633a184ec807572baf71a112ae276395","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf3853177d0ed76efbffee8ced1021003b085a26","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:python","ref":"python","sha":"cf3853177d0ed76efbffee8ced1021003b085a26","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the data source v2 API according to the [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DDXCTCrup4bKWByTalkXWgavcPdvur8a4eEu8x1BzPM/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nsummary of the changes\r\n1. rename `ReadSupport` -> `DataSourceReader` -> `InputPartition` -> `InputPartitionReader` to `BatchReadSupportProvider` -> `BatchReadSupport` -> `InputPartition`/`PartitionReaderFactory` -> `PartitionReader`. Similar renaming also happens at streaming and write APIs.\r\n2. create `ScanConfig` to store query specific information like operator pushdown result, streaming offsets, etc. This makes batch and streaming `ReadSupport`(previouslly named `DataSourceReader`) immutable. All other methods take `ScanConfig` as input, which implies applying operator pushdown and getting streaming offsets happen before all other things(get input partitions, report statistics, etc.).\r\n3. separate `InputPartition` to `InputPartition` and `PartitionReaderFactory`. This is a natural separation, data splitting and reading are orthogonal and we should not mix them in one interfaces. This also makes the naming consistent between read and write API: `PartitionReaderFactory` vs `DataWriterFactory`.\r\n4. separate the batch and streaming interfaces. Sometimes it's painful to force the streaming interface to extend batch interface, as we may need to override some batch methods to return false, or even leak the streaming concept to batch API(e.g. `DataWriterFactory#createWriter(partitionId, taskId, epochId)`)\r\n\r\nSome follow-ups we should do after this PR (tracked by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25186 ):\r\n1. Revisit the life cycle of `ReadSupport` instances. Currently I keep it same as the previous `DataSourceReader`, i.e. the life cycle is bound to the batch/stream query. This fits streaming very well but may not be perfect for batch source. We can also consider to let `ReadSupport.newScanConfigBuilder` take `DataSourceOptions` as parameter, if we decide to change the life cycle.\r\n2. Add `WriteConfig`. This is similar to `ScanConfig` and makes the write API more flexible. But it's only needed when we add the `replaceWhere` support, and it needs to change the streaming execution engine for this new concept, which I think is better to be done in another PR.\r\n3. Refine the document. This PR adds/changes a lot of document and it's very likely that some people may have better ideas.\r\n4. Figure out the life cycle of `CustomMetrics`. It looks to me that it should be bound to a `ScanConfig`, but we need to change `ProgressReporter` to get the `ScanConfig`. Better to be done in another PR.\r\n5. Better operator pushdown API. This PR keeps the pushdown API as it was, i.e. using the `SupportsPushdownXYZ` traits. We can design a better API using build pattern, but this is a complicated design and deserves an individual JIRA ticket and design doc.\r\n6. Improve the continuous streaming engine to only create a new `ScanConfig` when re-configuring.\r\n7. Remove `SupportsPushdownCatalystFilter`. This is actually not a must-have for file source, we can change the hive partition pruning to use the public `Filter`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe cartesian product of 2 RDDs perform a nested loop. This means that the iterator for the inner RDD is built as many times as the number of rows of the outer one. If the two RDDs have a very different size, the performance difference can be huge.\r\n\r\nAs there is no way to know which is the best RDD to choose as outer one (since we don't know the sizes), this cannot be addressed at RDD level. Only a comment has been added to warn/help the user to be careful about how they write their code.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposed to add an optimizer rule which uses statistics collected on tables in order to change the sides of the cartesian product so that the outer table is the smaller one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(In the PR,  I propose to use Alluxio to help store shuffle data in order to  improve the stability of complicated OLAP task. \r\n**Motivation**\r\n In original ways, when there is a shuffle fetch failure (NodeManager(shuffle service) crashed), spark will rerun previous stage to reproduce shuffle data. This way works well, but in some cases we cannot accept the recalculation price. \r\nIn this PR, when there is a  shuffle fetch failure , reduce will retry fetch shuffle data from Alluxio to avoid recalculation\r\n**Usage**\r\n1. Enable this feature in spark-default.conf.\r\n `spark.alluxio.shuffle.enabled ture`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-06T08:56:17Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:53Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fb6b4a6ec8d06487dcbc233c5733accad9b6381","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6fde2109635ad0f2b9cee72b50d1df2720ecd58","head":{"label":"Chopinxb:spark-shuffle-alluxio","ref":"spark-shuffle-alluxio","sha":"b6fde2109635ad0f2b9cee72b50d1df2720ecd58","user":{"login":"Chopinxb","id":22167234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTY3MjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22167234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb","html_url":"https://github.com/Chopinxb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143116462,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDMxMTY0NjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"Chopinxb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Chopinxb","id":22167234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTY3MjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22167234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb","html_url":"https://github.com/Chopinxb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chopinxb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Chopinxb/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDuring upgrading Apache ORC to 1.5.2 ([SPARK-24576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24576)), `sql/core` module overrides the exclusion rules of parent pom file and it causes published `spark-sql_2.1X` artifacts have incomplete exclusion rules ([SPARK-25019](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25019)). This PR fixes it by moving the newly added exclusion rule to the parent pom. This also fixes the sbt build hack introduced at that time.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the existing dependency check and the tests.","created_at":"2018-08-05T22:04:36Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T20:48:12Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T19:03:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cac38da79e45f21d1aab3f768d6b89c127b50ff5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a801498f249d7526b64fcb9fe8144325ebb3d4e4","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-25019","ref":"SPARK-25019","sha":"a801498f249d7526b64fcb9fe8144325ebb3d4e4","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"327bb30075834c873cdb78061c9b647e5e13b8a6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe shall check whether the barrier stage requires more slots (to be able to launch all tasks in the barrier stage together) than the total number of active slots currently, and fail fast if trying to submit a barrier stage that requires more slots than current total number.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new method `getNumSlots()` to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose new unary expression `StructFlatten` for flattening nested structures. For example, a dataset with the schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- st: struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- col1: long (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- col2: struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |    |-- col3: long (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\nby applying `struct_flatten(st)` it will be transformed to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- structflatten(st): struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- col1: long (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- col2_col3: long (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests to `CollectionExpressionsSuite` to check flattening of 2-3 nested structures and negative tests to be sure that `struct_flatten` doesn't affect other types.","created_at":"2018-08-04T20:55:16Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:32Z","closed_at":"2018-09-21T20:23:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9712af3306f1c92a673d4c1e1d1ab57131c0915e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/93b6358aae5acc3e2e465cdc174f882aeaf5d32d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:struct_flatten","ref":"struct_flatten","sha":"93b6358aae5acc3e2e465cdc174f882aeaf5d32d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis small fix adds a `consumer.release()` call to `KafkaSourceRDD` in the case where we've retrieved offsets from Kafka, but the `fromOffset` is equal to the `lastOffset`, meaning there is no new data to read for a particular topic partition. Up until now, we'd just return an empty iterator without closing the consumer which would cause a FD leak.\r\n\r\nIf accepted, this pull request should be merged into master as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHaven't ran any specific tests, would love help on how to test methods running inside `RDD.compute`.","created_at":"2018-08-04T07:31:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-04T19:47:56Z","closed_at":"2018-08-04T19:47:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76908db55ccf4a72a7f0b78fa406a64d41c1ad3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7558d422ae24daf9d3cffc43b5ef3d975c4c9d3a","head":{"label":"YuvalItzchakov:master","ref":"master","sha":"7558d422ae24daf9d3cffc43b5ef3d975c4c9d3a","user":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143408938,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM0MDg5Mzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"YuvalItzchakov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a configuration option for the maximum number of leaf expressions in collapsed project nodes. If a collapsed project node (result of the `CollapseProject` optimizer rule) would have more leaf expressions than the configured maximum number we don't collapse. This is to protect against an exponentially exploding number of leaf expressions when collapsing many (binary) expression that refer to the same columns (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24983).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [Linux community](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CommitMessageConventions), `Co-authored-by` and `Signed-off-by` git trailer have been used for awhile. \r\n\r\nUntil recently, Github adopted `Co-authored-by` to include the work of co-authors in the profile contributions graph and the repository's statistics. It's a convention for recognizing multiple authors, and can encourage people to collaborate in OSS communities.\r\n\r\nGit provides a command line tools to read the metadata to know who commits the code to upstream, but it's not as easy as having `Signed-off-by` as part of the message so developers can find who is the relevant committers who can help with certain part of the codebase easier.\r\n\r\nFor a single author PR, I purpose to use `Authored-by` and `Signed-off-by`, so the message will look like\r\n\r\n```\r\nAuthored-by: Author's name <author@example.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Committer's name <committer@example.com>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a multi-author PR, I purpose to use `Lead-authored-by:` and `Co-authored-by:` for the lead author and co-authors. The message will look like\r\n\r\n```\r\nLead-authored-by: Lead Author's name <leadauthor@example.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: CoAuthor's name <coauthor@example.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Committer's name <committer@example.com>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also useful to include `Reviewed-by:` to give credits to the people who participate on the code reviewing. We can add this in the next iteration.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously Pyspark used the private constructor for SparkSession when\r\nbuilding that object. This resulted in a SparkSession without checking\r\nthe sql.extensions parameter for additional session extensions. To fix\r\nthis we instead use the Session.builder() path as SparkR uses, this\r\nloads the extensions and allows their use in PySpark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAn integration test was added which mimics the Scala test for the same feature.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-03T16:07:12Z","updated_at":"2022-06-07T06:28:59Z","closed_at":"2018-10-18T04:34:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3aae1b43e3965d81cdd2d6bf849dab62bb95b195","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3629c78118eb77589ae1126e877f0fd2b57441ce","head":{"label":"RussellSpitzer:SPARK-25003-master","ref":"SPARK-25003-master","sha":"3629c78118eb77589ae1126e877f0fd2b57441ce","user":{"login":"RussellSpitzer","id":413025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzAyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/413025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer","html_url":"https://github.com/RussellSpitzer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RussellSpitzer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"703e6da1ecb52ab5b8f42b3b4cac39f27caa51d8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis small fix adds a `consumer.release()` call to `KafkaSourceRDD` in the case where we've retrieved offsets from Kafka, but the `fromOffset` is equal to the `lastOffset`, meaning there is no new data to read for a particular topic partition. Up until now, we'd just return an empty iterator without closing the consumer which would cause a FD leak.\r\n\r\nIf accepted, this pull request should be merged into master as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHaven't ran any specific tests, would love help on how to test methods running inside `RDD.compute`.","created_at":"2018-08-03T09:50:07Z","updated_at":"2018-08-04T07:31:47Z","closed_at":"2018-08-04T07:31:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"752705981408ae3f084d6c03d89a2d37e3f0b81b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e5db69f291bd099bee38d3b555b0c040ef942f29","head":{"label":"YuvalItzchakov:branch-2.3","ref":"branch-2.3","sha":"e5db69f291bd099bee38d3b555b0c040ef942f29","user":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143408938,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM0MDg5Mzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"YuvalItzchakov/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"YuvalItzchakov","id":3448320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDgzMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3448320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov","html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YuvalItzchakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/YuvalItzchakov/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike Uuid in SPARK-24896, Rand and Randn expressions now produce the same results for each execution in streaming query. It doesn't make too much sense for streaming queries. We should make them produce different results as Uuid.\r\n\r\nIn this change, similar to Uuid, we assign new random seeds to Rand/Randn when returning optimized plan from `IncrementalExecution`.\r\n\r\nNote: Different to Uuid, Rand/Randn can be created with initial seed. Because we replace this initial seed at `IncrementalExecution`, it doesn't use the initial seed anymore. For now it seems to me not a big issue for streaming query. But need to confirm with others. cc @zsxwing @cloud-fan \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds `CatalogTableIdentifier`, which is an identifier that consists of a triple: catalog, database, and table. Catalog and database are optional.\r\n\r\nThe existing `TableIdentifier` class extends `CatalogTableIdentifier` and is guarateed to have no defined catalog component. Classes that expect a `TableIdentifier` will continue to use `TableIdentifier` to ensure that catalogs are not leaked into code paths that do not support them.\r\n\r\nThis adds a parser rule, `catalogTableIdentifier`, that can parse identifiers with a catalog. An identifier with only two components will match database and table, leaving the catalog undefined. Only identifiers with three components will have a defined catalog. In addition, rules must be re-written to support `catalogTableIdentifier`. Existing rules will continue to use `tableIdentifier` with no catalog.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. This should not change any behavior.","created_at":"2018-08-02T21:38:16Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T15:42:17Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T15:42:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"136269e0577f75039a9f93cc8dff84767d182987","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/beebccf8acbaa1a8a14d6a256aa5ef0b7efefcec","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-25006-add-catalog-to-table-identifier","ref":"SPARK-25006-add-catalog-to-table-identifier","sha":"beebccf8acbaa1a8a14d6a256aa5ef0b7efefcec","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds `spark.executor.pyspark.memory` to configure Python's address space limit, [`resource.RLIMIT_AS`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html#resource.RLIMIT_AS). Limiting Python's address space allows Python to participate in memory management. In practice, we see fewer cases of Python taking too much memory because it doesn't know to run garbage collection. This results in YARN killing fewer containers. This also improves error messages so users know that Python is consuming too much memory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"build/bdist.linux-x86_64/egg/package/library.py\", line 265, in fe_engineer\r\n

between python and off-heap JVM activity.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested memory limits in our YARN cluster and verified that MemoryError is thrown.","created_at":"2018-08-02T19:32:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-27T18:41:30Z","closed_at":"2018-08-28T19:35:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5fe2f4f2aa59b9f58694d70d4cd8e0fa4167a7e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0b275cfea7d83cdf61802da30c4a7604be8900e4","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-25004-add-python-memory-limit","ref":"SPARK-25004-add-python-memory-limit","sha":"0b275cfea7d83cdf61802da30c4a7604be8900e4","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21758#discussion_r206746905 , current declaration of `BarrierTaskContext` didn't extend methods from `TaskContext`. Since `TaskContext` is an abstract class and we don't want to change it to a trait, we have to define class `BarrierTaskContext` directly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor this statement: select * from table1 where a = 100;\r\nthe data type of `a` is `smallint` , because the defaut data type of 100 is `int` ,so `a` is converted to `int`.\r\nIn this case, it does not support push down to parquet.\r\n\r\nIn our business, for our SQL statements, and we generally do not convert 100 to `smallint`, this pr can support push down to parquet for this situation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadded unit

[SPARK-24992](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24992)**\r\nUtils.getLocalDir is used to get path of a temporary directory. However, it always returns the the same directory, which is the first element in the array localRootDirs. When running on YARN, this might causes the case that we always write to one disk, which makes it busy while other disks are free. We should randomize the selection to spread out the loads. \r\n\r\n**What changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nThis PR randomized the selection of local directory inside the method Utils.getLocalDir. This change affects the Utils.fetchFile method since it based on the fact that Utils.getLocalDir always return the same directory to cache file. Therefore, a new variable cachedLocalDir is used to cache the first localDirectory that it gets from Utils.getLocalDir. Also, when getting the configured local directories (inside Utils. getConfiguredLocalDirs), in case we are in yarn mode, the array of directories are also randomized before return.","created_at":"2018-08-02T02:05:00Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T19:02:19Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T19:02:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31aca217981c9a077d70a920c0f6375d60a6c2de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a8c165475edc4dc8b4839aea3035ede380d316dc","head":{"label":"hthuynh2:SPARK_24992","ref":"SPARK_24992","sha":"a8c165475edc4dc8b4839aea3035ede380d316dc","user":{"login":"hthuynh2","id":15680678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15680678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2","html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136668094,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY2NjgwOTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"hthuynh2/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hthuynh2","id":15680678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15680678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2","html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded a configuration setting and table property to help avoid OOM errors during broadcast joins.\r\n\r\n- Configuration setting to ignore rawDataSize: Due to HIVE-20079, rawDataSize is broken. This setting tells Spark to ignore rawDataSize when calculating the table's sizeInBytes.\r\n- deser multiplication factor table property (\"deserFactor\"): Tell Spark to multiply totalSize times a specified factor. Spark will do this when calculating the table's sizeInBytes. This is modelled after Hive's hive.stats.deserialization.factor configuration setting (except that setting is global, and this one is per table).\r\n\r\nOne can partially simulate the deser multiplication factor without this change by decreasing the value in spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold. However, that will affect all tables, not just the ones where the user recognizes a need.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, checked that I can avoid broadcast join OOM errors when using the deser multiplication factor on both my laptop and a cluster. Also checked that I can avoid OOM errors using the ignore rawDataSize flag on my laptop.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-01T22:31:30Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T01:15:54Z","closed_at":"2019-09-20T16:58:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c61700d4ac582bc7f46ceefbdf5f4b57737770e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ddfe945ef161e59fc2bbc1a12bf40563d2bdd400","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-24914","ref":"SPARK-24914","sha":"ddfe945ef161e59fc2bbc1a12bf40563d2bdd400","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we do an average, the result is computed dividing the sum of the values by their count. In the case the result is a DecimalType, the way we are casting/managing the precision and scale is not really optimized and it is not coherent with what we do normally.\r\n\r\nIn particular, a problem can happen when the Divide operand returns a result which contains a precision and scale different by the ones which are expected as output of the Divide operand. In the case reported in the JIRA, for instance, the result of the Divide operand is a Decimal(38, 36), while the output data type for Divide is 38, 22. This is not an issue when the Divide is followed by a CheckOverflow or a Cast to the right data type, as these operations return a decimal with the defined precision and scale. Despite in the Average operator we do have a Cast, this may be bypassed if the result of Divide is the same type which it is casted to, hence the issue reported in the JIRA may arise.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to use the normal rules/handling of the arithmetic operators with Decimal data type, so we both reuse the existing code (having a single logic for operations between decimals) and we fix this problem as the result is always guarded by CheckOverflow.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded UT\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-01T19:27:05Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T08:45:14Z","closed_at":"2018-08-02T08:45:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a7e8ccbc3e7f9b7d1f4caaf62155c1ece5e2374","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f817a058887090ebf41c510a3b6086a062433d6","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-24957_2.2","ref":"SPARK-24957_2.2","sha":"1f817a058887090ebf41c510a3b6086a062433d6","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this Pull Request is to extend the Dataframe methods in order to add a method which casts all the values of a Dataframe, based on the DataTypes of a StructType.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be useful when we have a large dataframe, and that we need to make multiple casts. In that case, we won't have to cast each value independently, all we have to do is to pass a StructType to the method castBySchema with the types we need (In real world examples, this schema is generally provided by the client, which was my case).\r\n\r\nHere's an example here on how we can apply this method (let's say that we have a dataframe of strings, and that we want to cast the values of the second columns to Int) : \r\n```\r\n// We start by creating the dataframe\r\nval df = Seq((\"test1\", \"0\"), (\"test2\", \"1\")).toDF(\"name\", \"id\")\r\n\r\n// we prepare the StructType of the casted Dataframe that we'll obtain:\r\nval schema = StructType( Seq( StructField(\"name\", StringType, true), StructField(\"id\", IntegerType, true)))\r\n\r\n// and then, we simply use the method castBySchema :\r\nval castedDf = df.castBySchema(schema) \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI modified DataFrameSuite in order to test the new added method (castBySchema).\r\nI first tested the method on a simple dataframe with a simple schema, then I tested it on Dataframes with a complex schemas (Nested StructTypes for example).\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-01T15:09:45Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T17:19:56Z","closed_at":"2018-08-02T14:39:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"578859a1d0df96d669b8dfee2463be135cb70b17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b48819e3894e4d2f246fc2dba7db73ad5714757d","head":{"label":"mahmoudmahdi24:SPARK-24988","ref":"SPARK-24988","sha":"b48819e3894e4d2f246fc2dba7db73ad5714757d","user":{"login":"mahmoudmahdi24","id":4971795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24","html_url":"https://github.com/mahmoudmahdi24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137101129,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcxMDExMjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"mahmoudmahdi24/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mahmoudmahdi24","id":4971795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzE3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4971795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24","html_url":"https://github.com/mahmoudmahdi24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mahmoudmahdi24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mahmoudmahdi24/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the set operations INTERSECT, UNION and EXCEPT are assigned the same precedence. This PR fixes the problem by giving INTERSECT  higher precedence than UNION and EXCEPT. UNION and EXCEPT operators are evaluated in the order in which they appear in the query from left to right.\r\n\r\nThis results in change in behavior because of the change in order of evaluations of set operators in a query. The old behavior is still preserved under a newly added config parameter.\r\n\r\nQuery `:`\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM t1\r\nUNION \r\nSELECT * FROM t2\r\nEXCEPT\r\nSELECT * FROM t3\r\nINTERSECT\r\nSELECT

an option in Spark configuration to change the chunk size (which is by default 4 Mb).\r\n\r\nThis would allow to bypass the issue mentionned in SPARK-24917 by allowing users to define larger chunks.\r\nExplanation:\r\ncurrently, using netty < 4.1.28 (before this patch https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/9b95b8ee628983e3e4434da93fffb893edff4aa2), sending a ChunkedByteBuffer with more than 16 chunks over the network will trigger a \"merge\" of all the blocks into one big transient array that is then sent over the network. This is problematic as the total memory for all chunks can be high (2GB) and this would then trigger an allocation of 2GB to merge everything, which will create  OOM errors.\r\nA possibility to bypass this netty behavior is to make sure that they data is never split into more than 16 chunks. One way to do this is to create bigger chunks, which is currently fixed to 4MB. In this commit I'm allowing users to define bigger chunk sizes for their job, which allowed us to bypass this OOM error.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI'm introducing a configuration parameter to define the chunk size\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTested on several spark jobs, the changes actually work and generates \"chunks\" of the indicated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR addresses issues 2,3 in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fbkjEL878witxVQpOCbjlvOvadHtVjYXeB-2mgzDTvk).\r\n\r\n* We modified the closure cleaner to identify closures that are implemented via the LambdaMetaFactory mechanism (serializedLambdas) (issue2). \r\n\r\n* We also fix the issue due to scala/bug#11016. There are two options for solving the Unit issue, either add () at the end of the closure or use the trick described in the doc. Otherwise overloading resolution does not work (we are not going to eliminate either of the methods) here. Compiler tries to adapt to Unit and makes these two methods candidates for overloading, when there is polymorphic overloading there is no ambiguity (that is the workaround implemented). This does not look that good but it serves its purpose as we need to support two different uses for method: `addTaskCompletionListener`. One that passes a TaskCompletionListener and one that passes a closure that is wrapped with a TaskCompletionListener later on (issue3).\r\n\r\nNote: regarding issue 1 in the doc the plan is:\r\n\r\n> Do Nothing. Donâ€™t try to fix this as this is only a problem for Java users who would want to use 2.11 binaries. In that case they can cast to MapFunction to be able to utilize lambdas. In Spark 3.0.0 the API should be simplified so that this issue is removed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis was manually tested:\r\n```./dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.12\r\n./build/mvn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy default, KinesisInputDStream creates KinesisBackedBlockRDD. When an application tries to recover from streaming checkpoint, the RDD will access Kinesis directly to re-read data. As all partitions in the BlockRDD accesses Kinesis, and AWS Kinesis only supports 5 concurrency reads per shard per second, it will touch ProvisionedThroughputExceededException easily. And when the conflicts are heavy, the recover will be failed.\r\n\r\nMostly, when we use Spark streaming, we will enable WAL. Then we can recover data from WAL, instead of re-reading from Kinesis directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to create WriteAheadLogBackedBlockRDD for Kinesis Streaming if WAL is enabled. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn KinesisStreamSuite.scala, I will add a test case.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-31T07:59:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T02:06:12Z","closed_at":"2019-12-31T02:06:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6a69da85c5895aba4d17bcb426530aaca829200","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587334,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAMS","name":"DSTREAMS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21929/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21929/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21929/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cbff70a803a59fce0d6121fabd0f5958d7b0436d","head":{"label":"brucezhao11:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"cbff70a803a59fce0d6121fabd0f5958d7b0436d","user":{"login":"brucezhao11","id":7369752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjk3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7369752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11","html_url":"https://github.com/brucezhao11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":107363302,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDczNjMzMDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"brucezhao11/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brucezhao11","id":7369752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjk3NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7369752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11","html_url":"https://github.com/brucezhao11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brucezhao11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brucezhao11/spark","description":"Mirror

`BarrierStageOnSubmittedSuite`.","created_at":"2018-07-31T03:31:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T07:25:00Z","closed_at":"2018-08-02T16:40:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa9ab6c552c923b1b4956b58705f74917207500e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bb819f383b4024945d84622c90605872052213be","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:SPARK-24820","ref":"SPARK-24820","sha":"bb819f383b4024945d84622c90605872052213be","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror
