href=\"https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/v27.0.0-rc.1/docs/deprecated.md\">Deprecated Features</a>.</li>\n<li>Changes to the Engine API, see <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v27.0.0-rc.1/docs/api/version-history.md\">API version history</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add support to <code>docker stack deploy</code> for <code>driver_opts</code> in a service's networks. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/5125\">docker/cli#5125</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Add <code>--platform</code> flag to <code>docker image push</code> and improve the default behavior when not all platforms of the multi-platform image are available locally. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/4984\">docker/cli#4984</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47679\">moby/moby#47679</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a bug causing the docker CLI to leak UNIX sockets in <code>$TMPDIR</code> in some cases. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/docker/cli/pull/5146\">docker/cli#5146</a></li>\n<li>Don't ignore a custom seccomp profile when used in conjunction with <code>--privileged</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47500\">moby/moby#47500</a></li>\n<li>rootless: overlay2: support native overlay diff when using rootless-mode in kernel 5.11 and above <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47605\">moby/moby#47605</a></li>\n<li>Fix the <code>StartInterval</code> default value of healthcheck to reflect the documented value of 5s. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47799\">moby/moby#47799</a></li>\n<li>Allow sysctls to be set per-interface during container creation and network connection. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47686\">moby/moby#47686</a></li>\n<li>A ULA base prefix is automatically added to <code>default-address-pools</code> if this parameter wasn't manually configured, or if it contains no IPv6 prefixes. This ULA prefix is derived from the Engine host ID such that it's unique across hosts and over time. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47853\">moby/moby#47853</a></li>\n<li>Enable <code>ip6tables</code> by default, it is no longer <code>--experimental</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47747\">moby/moby#47747</a></li>\n<li>Introduce a new subnet allocator that can deal with IPv6 address pools of any size <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47768\">moby/moby#47768</a></li>\n<li>For IPv6-enabled bridge networks, do not attempt to replace the bridge's kernel-assigned link local address with <code>fe80::1</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47787\">moby/moby#47787</a></li>\n<li>Fix <code>docker save</code> and <code>docker load</code> not ending on the daemon side when the operation was cancelled (eg. Ctrl+C) <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47629\">moby/moby#47629</a></li>\n<li>Container's <code>StartedAt</code> property is now recorded before container startup, guaranteeing that the <code>FinishedAt</code> is always before <code>StartedAt</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47003\">moby/moby#47003</a></li>\n<li>Run an internal resolver on the default bridge network to forward DNS requests to external resolvers, even if they are on localhost addresses, or IPv6 addresses when the default bridge does not have IPv6 connectivity. To preserve existing behavior, the internal resolver on the default bridge will not resolve container names, unlike the resolver on user-defined networks. Do not use Google's DNS servers as a fallback when no external DNS servers are supplied in configuration via <code>--dns</code> or available from the host's <code>resolv.conf</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47602\">moby/moby#47602</a></li>\n<li>If firewalld is running on the host, create policy <code>docker-forwarding</code> to allow forwarding from any zone to the <code>docker</code> zone. This makes it possible to configure a bridge network with a routable IPv6 address, and no masquerading. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47745\">moby/moby#47745</a></li>\n<li>IPv6 can now be enabled by default on all custom networks using <code>dockerd --default-network-opt=bridge=com.docker.network.enable_ipv6=true</code> (and the matching json option). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/47867\">moby/moby#47867</a></li>\n<li>The internal DNS resolver used by Windows containers on Windows will now forward requests to external DNS servers by-default, this enables <code>nslookup</code> to resolve external hostnames.

The <code>Config</code> field returned by this endpoint (used for &quot;image inspect&quot;) returned additional fields that are not part of the image's configuration and not part of the [Docker Image Spec] and the [OCI Image Spec]. These fields are never set (and always return the default value for the type), but are not omitted in the response when left empty. As these fields were not intended to be part of the image configuration response, they are deprecated, and will be removed in the future API versions.\nThe following fields are currently included in the API response, but are not part of the underlying image's Config, and deprecated:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Hostname</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For dev versions, requires an override\r\n  * Version used for this can be overridden by `--prism_beam_version_override`\r\n* The above is fully overridden by a `--prism_location` flag that provides a location of an appropriate zip or binary for the local platform, or the root github release page for a version, to use the download logic.

PR updates usage of the `com.gradle.enterprise` plugin to the equivalent `com.gradle.develocity` plugin as a result of renaming Gradle Enterprise to Develocity. This change will result in no functional changes to the Beam project.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the changes have been broken up into 4 commits:\r\n* Applying and configuring the Develocity plugin via the new `develocity` configuration\r\n* Mass renaming GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY to DEVELOCITY_ACCESS_KEY for the new plugin in GitHub Actions workflows (sorry, there are lots 😅)\r\n* Applying the most recent Common Custom User Data Gradle Plugin (2.0.1)\r\n* Ensuring remote cache push is disabled in forks that cannot write to the remote cache\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

make a PTransform upgradable, we need to write some translation logic for it (see [TransformPayloadTranslator](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/d560aa63d58145546def09aba7db6f0c8f39dbe0/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/util/construction/PTransformTranslation.java#L631)). Essentially, this is logic that can:\r\n- translate a transform to its corresponding FunctionSpec proto\r\n- produce a configuration Row from a transform instance\r\n- re-construct the transform using a configuration Row\r\n\r\nSo far, this has meant handwriting large customized logic for each IO (see translation for [BigQueryIO](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIOTranslation.java), [KafkaIO](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/upgrade/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/upgrade/KafkaIOTranslation.java)). While this may be unavoidable for some IOs, the logic can be unified for SchemaTransforms, which already operate using Beam Rows.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the SchemaTransformProvider implementation needs to just add one line when building the SchemaTransform: \r\n- `.register(<config row>, <identifier>)` on the SchemaTransform itself, or\r\n- `register(<config>, <schematransform>)` after building the SchemaTransform in TypedSchemaTransformProvider. \r\n\r\nBy storing this information in the transform instance, it can be translated using the SchemaTransformTranslator. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes a few such improvements, removing the handwritten translation logic for Iceberg(Read/Write)SchemaTransform, Kafka(Read/Write)SchemaTransform, ManagedSchemaTransform. \r\nP.S. these were already shorter than usual because of the SchemaTransformPayloadTranslator abstraction introduced in #30910. This PR is a continuation to further simplify

refactoring, the StreamingDataflowWorker factory method was changed to create two\r\ndifferent StateCache instead of using one consistently.\r\n\r\nThis affects what is displayed on status pages as well as causing different cache objects to be used if the cache is accessed in different ways.  This seems like it causes cache invalidation on failures or commit stuckness to not occur. With work token and cache token guards for the cache usage, I don't believe this invalidation is strictly necessary.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

will make it much easier to use YAML for writing dataflow templates. In particular, one will be able to specify the ParameterMetadata as one does for other templates, along with a (presumably hidden) parameter enumerating these parameters as `jinja_variable_flags` and a (likewise likely hidden) parameter for `yaml_pipeline_file` pointing to the yaml file on GCS and using the standard YAML template base image.\r\n\r\nFuture work could possibly automate this.\r\n\r\nWe could consider putting this code at https://github.com/Polber/DataflowTemplates/blob/main/python/src/main/python/yaml-template/main.py , but this form seems non-invasive enough to keep here (especially compared to the other variant that just blindly interpreted all flags as jinja variables) and that lets the template version simply delegate everything to this main. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
