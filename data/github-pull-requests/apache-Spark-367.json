What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTo ensure that the deserialization of TaskMetrics uses a ClassLoader that knows about RDDBlockIds. The problem occurs only very rarely since it depends on which thread of the thread pool is used for the heartbeat.\n\nI observe that the code in question has been largely rewritten for v2.0.0 of Spark and the problem no longer manifests. However it would seem reasonable to fix this for those users who need to continue with the 1.6 version for some time yet. Hence I have created a fix for the 1.6 code branch.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nDue to the nature of the problem a reproducible testcase is difficult to produce. This problem was causing our application's nightly integration tests to fail randomly. Since applying the fix the tests have not failed due to this problem, for nearly six weeks now.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T10:50:33Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T13:33:41Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T13:33:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"314a939f8a25c22165e78dd415ae215f86e2bcc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ea4dcaf6ab8bc776f28b17a3d35668f3471b0af","head":{"label":"simonjscott:fix-10722","ref":"fix-10722","sha":"9ea4dcaf6ab8bc776f28b17a3d35668f3471b0af","user":{"login":"simonjscott","id":7726893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjY4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7726893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott","html_url":"https://github.com/simonjscott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56044841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjA0NDg0MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"simonjscott/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"simonjscott","id":7726893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjY4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7726893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott","html_url":"https://github.com/simonjscott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonjscott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/simonjscott/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently directly call `explain` on streaming Dataset will get exception for optimized logical plan and physical plan:\n\n```\nscala> res0.explain(true)\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\nFileSource[file:///tmp/input]\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\nvalue: string\nFileSource[file:///tmp/input]\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Queries with streaming sources must be executed with write.startStream();\n== Physical Plan ==\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Queries with streaming sources must be executed with write.startStream();\n```\n\nInside `StreamExecution`, logical plan still needs to tranform to finally materialize in the run-time. Also in the future optimized logical plan and physical plan may be changed according the different batch. So here propose a way to get an explained plan in the run-time for continuous query.\n\nUser could use like:\n\n```\nval query = spark.read.format(\"text\").stream(\"file:///tmp/input\")\n  .write\n  .format(\"console\")\n  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"file:///tmp/checkpoint1\")\n  .trigger(ProcessingTime(\"2 seconds\"))\n  .startStream()\n\n// This could be called in the runtime\nquery.explain()\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd unit test.\n\nPropose one possible solution, please help to review, thanks lot for your time.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T09:26:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T20:42:08Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T20:42:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acdb29dd9136b2980a5324d5b99b68ae7e11db04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f19351f986047b3c29ca027476d6a22a4933a0cd","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-15443","ref":"SPARK-15443","sha":"f19351f986047b3c29ca027476d6a22a4933a0cd","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

To separate spark.mllib from spark.ml, we should implement the picklers of new vector/matrix under `spark.ml.python` instead.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCSRF prevention for REST APIs can be provided through a common servlet filter. This filter would check for the existence of an custom HTTP header - such as `X-XSRF-Header`.\nThe fact that CSRF attacks are entirely browser based means that the above approach can ensure that requests are coming from either: applications served by the same origin as the REST API or that there is explicit policy configuration that allows the setting of a header on XmlHttpRequest from another origin.\nWe have done similar work for Hadoop (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12691) and other components.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T07:13:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T05:23:34Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T05:23:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26c3de5c1fe6836b73c4f4328597a498df1982a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/93b1c6f7f75b8b32246d1949e775ac091b02a7e3","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-15440","ref":"spark-15440","sha":"93b1c6f7f75b8b32246d1949e775ac091b02a7e3","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently command `ADD FILE|JAR <filepath | jarpath>` is supported natively in SparkSQL. However, when this command is run, the file/jar is added to the resources that can not be looked up by `LIST FILE(s)|JAR(s)` command because the `LIST` command is passed to Hive command processor in Spark-SQL or simply not supported in Spark-shell. There is no way users can find out what files/jars are added to the spark context.\nRefer to [Hive commands](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli)\n\nThis PR is to support following commands:\n`LIST (FILE[s] [filepath ...] | JAR[s] [jarfile ...])`\n### For example:\n##### LIST FILE(s)\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"add file hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/tmp/test.txt\")\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\nscala> spark.sql(\"add file hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/tmp/test1.txt\")\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\n\nscala> spark.sql(\"list file hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/tmp/test1.txt\").show(false)\n+----------------------------------------------+\n|result                                        |\n+----------------------------------------------+\n|hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/tmp/test1.txt|\n+----------------------------------------------+\n\nscala> spark.sql(\"list files\").show(false)\n+----------------------------------------------+\n|result                                        |\n+----------------------------------------------+\n|hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/tmp/test1.txt|\n|hdfs://bdavm009.svl.ibm.com:8020/tmp/test.txt |\n+----------------------------------------------+\n```\n##### LIST JAR(s)\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"add jar /Users/xinwu/spark/core/src/test/resources/TestUDTF.jar\")\nres9: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [result: int]\n\nscala> spark.sql(\"list jar TestUDTF.jar\").show(false)\n+---------------------------------------------+\n|result                                       |\n+---------------------------------------------+\n|spark://192.168.1.234:50131/jars/TestUDTF.jar|\n+---------------------------------------------+\n\n\nscala> spark.sql(\"list jars\").show(false)\n+---------------------------------------------+\n|result                                       |\n+---------------------------------------------+\n|spark://192.168.1.234:50131/jars/TestUDTF.jar|\n+---------------------------------------------+\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test cases are added for Spark-SQL, Spark-Shell and SparkContext API code path.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T04:42:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T15:54:30Z","closed_at":"2016-05-24T00:33:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d1ebafaa08c6a78b169e1852f8cc1d5b652d75e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f5c17aa00f2e210a35779b9f7e55cc99b895461","head":{"label":"xwu0226:list_command","ref":"list_command","sha":"5f5c17aa00f2e210a35779b9f7e55cc99b895461","user":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42968936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk2ODkzNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"xwu0226/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `ListAccumulator` we create an unmodifiable view for underlying list. However, it doesn't prevent the underlying to be modified further. So as we access the unmodifiable list, the underlying list can be modified in the same time. It could cause `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`. We can observe such exception in recent tests.\n\nTo fix it, we can copy a list of the underlying list and then create the unmodifiable view of this list instead.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe exception might be difficult to test. Existing tests should be passed.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T04:22:31Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:19:40Z","closed_at":"2016-05-22T13:10:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1541fec60536628e8f3c48cd3ef2466d6c32587","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3af08bd7c417520854971d2d14fb4ae608a9522a","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-concurrentmodify","ref":"fix-concurrentmodify","sha":"3af08bd7c417520854971d2d14fb4ae608a9522a","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI initially asked to create a hivecontext-compatibility module to put the HiveContext there. But we are so close to Spark 2.0 release and there is only a single class in it. It seems overkill to have an entire package, which makes it more inconvenient, for a single class.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests were moved.\n","created_at":"2016-05-19T23:55:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T05:03:42Z","closed_at":"2016-05-21T05:03:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c4eae2357d0984087a88c562be40e101624e8b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7d0d69256e7094a746047baa9a43286f16da606","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15424","ref":"SPARK-15424","sha":"c7d0d69256e7094a746047baa9a43286f16da606","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

is currently based on SPARK-14543 and includes its commits.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- WriterContainer detects that the incoming logical plan has been sorted and **does not sort a second time** if the sort matches the table's partitioning, bucketing, and sorting.\n- Local sort is added by the optimizer for CatalogTables that have bucket or sort columns. This **implements `sortBy` for Hive tables**.\n- Repartition and sort operations are added when `DataFrameWriter#writersPerPartition(Int)` is set. This **enables users to easily control how many files per partition are created**.\n- Repartition and sort operations are added by the optimizer for columnar formats like Parquet if enabled by spark.sql.files.columnar.insertRepartition (and does not conflict with the query).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWIP: adding tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-19T23:33:32Z","updated_at":"2019-07-13T02:07:48Z","closed_at":"2018-09-19T18:30:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a64be8a91ddadcd7acbbd08956f214b3c40f0dca","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-15420-parquet-repartition-sort","ref":"SPARK-15420-parquet-repartition-sort","sha":"a64be8a91ddadcd7acbbd08956f214b3c40f0dca","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we parse DDLs involving table or database properties, we need to validate the values.\nE.g. if we alter a database's property without providing a value:\n\n```\nALTER DATABASE my_db SET DBPROPERTIES('some_key')\n```\n\nThen we'll ignore it with Hive, but override the property with the in-memory catalog. Inconsistencies like these arise because we don't validate the property values.\n\nIn such cases, we should throw exceptions instead.\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere is no way to use the Hive catalog in `pyspark-shell`. This is because we used to create a `SparkContext` before calling `SparkSession.enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()`, which just gets the existing `SparkContext` instead of creating a new one. As a result, `spark.sql.catalogImplementation` was never propagated.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual.\n","created_at":"2016-05-19T21:21:52Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T17:56:07Z","closed_at":"2016-05-20T06:45:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8c2be92237d707c6986fef29f871a6216e65eeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7a1027a305d4deaa91f9b84d160754dd563052d","head":{"label":"andrewor14:fix-pyspark-shell","ref":"fix-pyspark-shell","sha":"a7a1027a305d4deaa91f9b84d160754dd563052d","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPySpark: Add links to the predictors from the models in regression.py, improve linear and isotonic pydoc in minor ways.\nUser guide / R: Switch the installed package list to be enough to build the R docs on a \"fresh\" install on ubuntu and add sudo to match the rest of the commands.\nUser Guide: Add a note about using gem2.0 for systems with both 1.9 and 2.0 (e.g. some ubuntu but maybe more).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nbuilt pydocs locally, tested new user build

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe're using `asML` to convert the mllib vector/matrix to ml vector/matrix now. Using `as` is more correct given that this conversion actually shares the same underline data structure. As a result, in this PR, `toBreeze` will be changed to `asBreeze`. This is a private API, as a result, it will not affect any user's application.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is an up-to-date and a little bit improved version of #11019 of @rxin for\n- (1) preventing recursive printing of expressions in generated

In addition to #11019, this PR improves the followings in code generation.\n- (2) Improve multiline comment indentation.\n- (3) Reduce the number of empty lines (mainly consecutive empty lines).\n- (4) Remove all space characters on empty lines.\n\n**Example**\n\n``` scala\nspark.range(1, 1000).select('id+1+2+3, 'id+4+5+6)\n```\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nGenerated code:\n/* 001 */ public Object

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOn the SparkUI right now we have this SQLTab that displays accumulator values per operator. However, it only displays metrics updated on the executors, not on the driver. It is useful to also include driver metrics, e.g. broadcast time.\n\nThis is a different version from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12427. This PR sends driver side accumulator updates right after the updating happens, not at the end of execution, by a new event.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR corrects another case that uses deprecated `accumulableCollection` to use `listAccumulator`, which seems the previous PR missed.\n\nSince `ArrayBuffer[InternalRow].asJava` is `java.util.List[InternalRow]`, it seems ok to replace the usage.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRelated existing tests `InMemoryColumnarQuerySuite` and `CachedTableSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-05-19T04:01:42Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:30Z","closed_at":"2016-05-19T18:56:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ee92829df520e15888a214810be6e8080431196","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b07d09301e9c6695e3586e06852f679594d988d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15322","ref":"SPARK-15322","sha":"9b07d09301e9c6695e3586e06852f679594d988d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

while in Spark, `locate(\"aa\", \"aaa\", 0)` would yield 1,  `locate(\"aa\", \"aaa\", 1)` would yield 2 and  `locate(\"aa\", \"aaa\", 2)` would yield 0. This results from the different understanding of the third parameter in udf `locate`. It means the starting index and starts from 1, so when we use 0, the return would always be 0.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\ntested with modified `StringExpressionsSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRight now the netty RPC uses `InetSocketAddress.getHostName` to create `RpcAddress` for network events. If we use an IP address to connect, then the RpcAddress's host will be a host name (if the reverse lookup successes) instead of the IP address. However, some places need to compare the original IP address and the RpcAddress in `onDisconnect` (e.g., CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend), and this behavior will make the check incorrect.\n\nThis PR uses `getHostString` to resolve the issue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-19T00:29:06Z","updated_at":"2016-05-19T17:47:58Z","closed_at":"2016-05-19T03:16:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63869efbe00e624f71d03608172992631be8e287","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be7ec5ffc140c59935479332698fef640626d8e2","head":{"label":"zsxwing:host-string","ref":"host-string","sha":"be7ec5ffc140c59935479332698fef640626d8e2","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"32be51fba45f5e07a2a3520293c12dc7765a364d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe use autoBroadcastJoinThreshold + 1L as the default value of size estimation, that is not good in 2.0, because we will calculate the size based on size of schema, then the estimation could be less than autoBroadcastJoinThreshold if you have an SELECT on top of an DataFrame created from RDD.\n\nThis PR change the default value to Long.MaxValue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe use  autoBroadcastJoinThreshold + 1L as the default value of size estimation, that is not good in 2.0, because we will calculate the size based on size of schema, then the estimation could be less than autoBroadcastJoinThreshold if you have an SELECT on top of an DataFrame created from RDD.\n\nThis PR change the default value to Long.MaxValue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is a follow-up of #13079. It replaces `hasUnsupportedFeatures: Boolean` in `CatalogTable` with `unsupportedFeatures: Seq[String]`, which contains unsupported Hive features of the underlying Hive table. In this way, we can accurately report all unsupported Hive features in the exception message.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated existing test case to check exception

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR generates Java code to store a computed float/double value of each column into ```ColumnarBatch` when DataFrame.cache() is called. This is done in whole stage code generation.\n\nEven when data is read from ParquetReader (data is kept in `ColumnarBatch`), the computed value is stored into `UnsafeRow` for now. Then, the data is stored into `CachedBatch` for DataFrame.cache(). This leads to data format conversions from columnar storage to row-oriented storage and from row-oriented storage to columnar storage. This PR avoid conversions by storing the computed value into a columnar storege.\n\nThis PR handles only float and double that are stored in a column without compression. Another PR will handle other primitive types that may be stored in a column in a compressed format. This is for ease of review by reducing the size of PR\n\nThis PR will consist of three parts.\n1. Store the computed value into `CachedBatch` when the original value is read from `ColumnarStorage`.\n2. Create `CachedBatch` for `df.cache()` from the `ColumnarStorage`\n3. Decide whether 1. will be done or not based on the successor operation. If the successor operation is not `df.cache()`, 1. will not occur.\n\nThis PR generates Java code for columnar cache only if types in all columns, which are accessed in operations, are primitive\n\nMotivating example:\n\n```\nsc.parallelize(1 to 8, 1).map(i => i.toFloat).toDF(\"f\").write.parquet(parquetDir)\nval parquetDF = sqlContext.read.parquet(parquetDir)\nval df = parquetDF.selectExpr(\"f + 1\").cache.show\n```\n\nGenerated code\n\n``` java\n/* 001 */ public Object generate(Object[] references) {\n/* 002 */   return new GeneratedIterator(references);\n/* 003 */

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR corrects SparkR to use `shell()` instead of `system2()` on Windows.\n\nUsing `system2(...)` on Windows does not process windows file separator `\\`. `shell(tralsate = TRUE, ...)` can treat this problem. So, this was changed to be chosen according to OS.\n\nExisting tests were failed on Windows due to this problem. For example, those were failed.\n\n```\n8. Failure: sparkJars tag in SparkContext (@test_includeJAR.R#34)\n9. Failure: sparkJars tag in SparkContext (@test_includeJAR.R#36)\n```\n\nThe cases above were due to using of `system2`.\n\nIn addition, this PR also fixes some tests failed on Windows.\n\n```\n5. Failure: sparkJars sparkPackages as comma-separated strings (@test_context.R#128) \n6. Failure: sparkJars sparkPackages as comma-separated strings (@test_context.R#131) \n7. Failure: sparkJars sparkPackages as comma-separated strings (@test_context.R#134) \n```\n\n  The cases above were due to a weird behaviour of `normalizePath()`. On Linux, if the path does not exist, it just prints out the input but it prints out including the current path on Windows.\n\n``` r\n# On Linus\npath <- normalizePath(\"aa\")\nprint(path)\n[1] \"aa\"\n\n# On Windows\npath <- normalizePath(\"aa\")\nprint(path)\n[1] \"C:\\\\Users\\\\aa\"\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests and manually tested in a Window machine as below:\n\nHere is the [stdout](https://gist.github.com/HyukjinKwon/4bf35184f3a30f3bce987a58ec2bbbab) of testing.\n\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis adds support for radix sort of nullable long fields. When a sort field is null and radix sort is enabled, we keep nulls in a separate region of the sort buffer so that radix sort does not need to deal with them. This also has performance benefits when sorting smaller integer types, since the current representation of nulls in two's complement (Long.MIN_VALUE) otherwise forces a full-width radix sort.\n\nThis strategy for nulls does mean the sort is no longer stable. cc @davies \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting randomized sort tests for correctness. I also tested some TPCDS queries and there does not seem to be any significant regression for non-null sorts.\n\nSome test queries (best of 5 runs each).\nBefore change:\nscala> val start = System.nanoTime; spark.range(5000000).selectExpr(\"if(id > 5, cast(hash(id) as long), NULL) as h\").coalesce(1).orderBy(\"h\").collect(); (System.nanoTime - start) / 1e6\nstart: Long =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, SparkUI shows two timezones in a single page when the timezone of browser is different from the server JVM timezone. The following is an example on Databricks CE which uses 'Etc/UTC' timezone.\n- The time of `submitted` column of list and pop-up description shows `2016/05/18 00:03:07`\n- The time of `timeline chart` shows `2016/05/17 17:03:07`.\n\n![Different Timezone](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12804553/12804553_timezone.png)\n\nThis PR fixes the **timeline chart** to use the same timezone by the followings.\n- Upgrade `vis` from 3.9.0(2015-01-16)  to 4.16.1(2016-04-18)\n- Override `moment` of `vis` to get `offset`\n- Update `AllJobsPage`, `JobPage`, and `StagePage`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual. Run the following command and see the Spark UI's event timelines.\n\n```\n$ SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS=\"-Dscala.usejavacp=true -Duser.timezone=Etc/UTC\" bin/spark-submit --class

`hivecontext-compatibility`\n","created_at":"2016-05-17T22:06:49Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T06:41:43Z","closed_at":"2016-05-20T06:40:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"099230f9084a3b7d74d783eafce1bcd8e3ec0242","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20d50556c6a3a4ca2d69f961822a2bb058edbbec","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:refreshTable","ref":"refreshTable","sha":"20d50556c6a3a4ca2d69f961822a2bb058edbbec","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request fixes the COUNT bug in the `RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery` rule.\n\nAfter this change, the rule tests the expression at the root of the correlated subquery to determine whether the expression returns NULL on empty input. If the expression does not return NULL, the rule generates additional logic in the Project operator above the rewritten subquery.  This additional logic intercepts NULL values coming from the outer join and replaces them with the value that the subquery's expression would return on empty input.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression tests to cover all branches of the updated rule (see changes to `SubquerySuite.scala`).\nRan all existing automated regression tests after merging with latest trunk.\n","created_at":"2016-05-17T21:11:22Z","updated_at":"2016-06-12T21:41:42Z","closed_at":"2016-06-12T21:23:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58948e45e5bb037853f6e16fa143d0be20b0efd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8cd2877179dded4557c8da92e5b16011637289b0","head":{"label":"frreiss:master","ref":"master","sha":"8cd2877179dded4557c8da92e5b16011637289b0","user":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"be99a99fe7976419d727c0cc92e872aa4af58bf1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn general, the Web UI doesn't need to store the Accumulator/AccumulableInfo for every task. It only needs the Accumulator values.\n\nIn this PR, it creates new UIData classes to store the necessary fields and make `JobProgressListener` store only these new classes, so that `JobProgressListener` won't store Accumulator/AccumulableInfo and the size of `JobProgressListener` becomes pretty small. I also eliminates `AccumulableInfo` from `SQLListener` so that we don't keep any references for those unused `AccumulableInfo`s.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI ran two tests reported in JIRA locally:\n\nThe first one is:\n\n```\nval data = spark.range(0, 10000, 1, 10000)\ndata.cache().count()\n```\n\nThe retained size of JobProgressListener decreases from 60.7M to 6.9M.\n\nThe second one is:\n\n```\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.CC\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext\nval sqlContext = SQLContext.getOrCreate(sc)\nCC.runTest(sqlContext)\n```\n\nThis test won't cause OOM after applying this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR makes block replication strategies pluggable. It provides two trait that can be implemented, one that maps a host to its topology and is used in the master, and the second that helps prioritize a list of peers for block replication and would run in the executors.\n\nThis patch contains default implementations of these traits that make sure current Spark behavior is unchanged.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch should not change Spark behavior in any way, and was tested with unit tests for storage.\n","created_at":"2016-05-17T18:24:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-01T01:26:49Z","closed_at":"2016-10-01T01:26:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a030264f7342c12c686161ed815b339ac8fca47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/632d0436ca701031e03bd141b95d4b0bb5544150","head":{"label":"shubhamchopra:RackAwareBlockReplication","ref":"RackAwareBlockReplication","sha":"632d0436ca701031e03bd141b95d4b0bb5544150","user":{"login":"shubhamchopra","id":6588487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra","html_url":"https://github.com/shubhamchopra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59029814,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTAyOTgxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"shubhamchopra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shubhamchopra","id":6588487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra","html_url":"https://github.com/shubhamchopra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shubhamchopra/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently if a table is used in join operation we rely on Metastore returned size to calculate if we can convert the operation to Broadcast join. This optimization only kicks in for table's that have the statistics available in metastore.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAfter we moving `HiveSqlParser` to `SparkSqlParser` in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12556, most of test cases in `HiveDDLCommandSuite` should be also moved to `DDLCommandSuite`.\n\nThe test suites named `DDLCommandSuite` and `HiveDDLCommandSuite` are very confusing. We already have `PlanParserSuite` for `catalyst.parser`. To make them consistent, we should rename them. **How about using the same names?** They are basically for the same goals.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen table is created with column name containing dot, distinct() will fail to run. For example,\n\n``` scala\nval rowRDD = sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(Row(1), Row(1), Row(2)))\nval schema = StructType(Array(StructField(\"column.with.dot\", IntegerType, nullable = false)))\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(rowRDD, schema)\n```\n\nrunning the following will have no problem: \n\n``` scala\ndf.select(new Column(\"`column.with.dot`\"))\n```\n\nbut running the query with additional distinct() will cause exception:\n\n``` scala\ndf.select(new Column(\"`column.with.dot`\")).distinct()\n```\n\nThe issue is that distinct() will try to resolve the column name, but the column name in the schema does not have backtick with it. So the solution is to add the backtick before passing the column name to resolve().\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new test

ought to be included in the user guide since there is a lot of variability within the current user guide. I tried to give a fairly brief mathematical introduction to GLMs, and cover what types of problems they could be used for. Additionally, I included a brief blurb on the IRLS solver. The input/output columns are given in a table as is found elsewhere in the docs (though, again, these appear rather intermittently in the current docs), as well as a table providing the supported families and their link

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems most of Python examples were changed to use SparkSession by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12809. This PR said both examples below:\n- `simple_params_example.py`\n- `aft_survival_regression.py`\n\nare not changed because it dose not work. It seems `aft_survival_regression.py` is changed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13050 but `simple_params_example.py` is not yet.\n\nThis PR corrects the example and make this use SparkSession.\n\nIn more detail, it seems `threshold` is replaced to `thresholds` here and there by https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5a23213c148bfe362514f9c71f5273ebda0a848a. However, when it calls `lr.fit(training, paramMap)` this overwrites the values. So, `threshold` was 5 and `thresholds` becomes 5.5 (by `1 / (1 + thresholds(0) / thresholds(1)`).\n\nAccording to the comment below. this is not allowed, https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/354f8f11bd4b20fa99bd67a98da3525fd3d75c81/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/classification/LogisticRegression.scala#L58-L61.\n\nSo, in this PR, it sets the equivalent value so that this does not throw an exception. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManully (`mvn package -DskipTests && spark-submit simple_params_example.py`)\n","created_at":"2016-05-16T11:12:31Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:31Z","closed_at":"2016-05-19T06:54:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f9a7c7a0544c679993c6e511a71619f1c0c5f4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ec58e6368d848b90b94145a1bb1354587898d82","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15031","ref":"SPARK-15031","sha":"9ec58e6368d848b90b94145a1bb1354587898d82","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

@srowen \n\nI state that the contribution is my original work and that I license the work to the project under the project's open source license\n\nThere's some format problems with my last PR, with @HyukjinKwon 's help I read the guidance, re-check my code and PR, then run the tests, finally re-submit the PR request here.\n\nThe related JIRA issue though marked as resolved, this change may relate to it I think.\n## Proposed Change\n\nAfter picking each new initial centers, it's unnecessary to compute the distances between all the points and the old ones. \nInstead this change keeps the distance between all the points and their closest centers, and compare to the distance of them with the new center then update them.\n## Test result\n\nOne can find an easy test way in (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-6706)\n\nI test the KMeans++ method for a small dataset with 16k points, and the whole KMeans|| with a large one with 240k points.\nThe data has 4096 features and I tunes K from 100 to 500.\nThe test environment was on my 4 machine cluster, I also tested a 3M points data on a larger cluster with 25 machines and got similar results, which I would not draw the detail curve. The result of the first two exps are shown below\n### Local KMeans++ test:\n\nDataset:4m_ini_center\nData_size:16234\nDimension:4096 \n\nLloyd's Iteration = 10\nThe y-axis is time in sec, the x-axis is tuning the K.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10915169/15175831/d0c92b82-179a-11e6-8b68-4e165fc2fdff.png)\n\n![local_total](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10915169/15175957/6b21c3b0-179b-11e6-9741-66dfe4e23eb7.jpg)\n### On a larger dataset\n\nAn improve show in the graph but not commit in this file: In this experiment I also have an improvement for calculation in normalization data (the distance is convert to the cosine distance). As if the data is normalized into (0,1), one improvement in the original vesion for util.MLUtils.fastSauaredDistance would have no effect (the precisionBound 2.0 \\* EPSILON \\* sumSquaredNorm / (normDiff \\* normDiff + EPSILON) will never less then precision in this case). Therefore I design an early terminal method when comparing two distance (used for findClosest). But I don't include this improve in this file, you may only refer to the curves without \"normalize\" for comparing the results.\n\nDataset:4k24  \nData_size:243960\nDimension:4096\n\nNormlize

x-for value of K, y-for time in sec\n![4k24_total](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10915169/15176635/9a54c0bc-179e-11e6-81c5-238e0c54bce2.jpg)\n\nSE for unnormalized data between two

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is sort of a hot-fix for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13117, but, the problem is limited to Hadoop 2.2. The change is to manage `commons-io` to 2.4 for all Hadoop builds, which is only a net change for Hadoop 2.2, which was using 2.1.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests -- normal PR builder,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, we are facing two issues when using the Set Command. \n1. When changing a Hive-related conf at runtime, we are not passing the change to the underlying Hive metastore. For example, `SET hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=/x/y/z` The following link contains the possible conf: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties\n2. When changing the warehouse path conf `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`, we are not changing the corresponding Hive metastore default warehouse path conf: `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir`. Thus, this change does not take effect if the underlying catalog is Hive metastore.\n\nThis PR is to fix the above two issues by using the native Hive SQL interface, if necessary. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded two test cases to verify if the run-time configuration works in either Hive metastore or In-Memory Catalog\n","created_at":"2016-05-16T07:03:11Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T04:42:24Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T04:42:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/372b492d3d96070f270f88b8304137a2ebd1a440","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:hiveConfChange","ref":"hiveConfChange","sha":"372b492d3d96070f270f88b8304137a2ebd1a440","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHiveClient facade is not compatible with Hive 0.12.\n\nThis PR Fixes the following compatibility issues:\n1. `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl` use `AddPartitionDesc(db, table, ignoreIfExists)` to create partitions, however, Hive 0.12 doesn't have this constructor for `AddPartitionDesc`.\n2. `HiveClientImpl` uses `PartitionDropOptions` when dropping partition, however, class `PartitionDropOptions` doesn't exist in Hive 0.12.\n3. Hive 0.12 doesn't support adding permanent functions. It is not valid to call `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.createFunction`, `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.alterFunction`, and `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.alterFunction`\n4. `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.VersionsSuite` doesn't have enough test coverage for different hive versions 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n","created_at":"2016-05-15T22:28:43Z","updated_at":"2016-05-18T08:02:25Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T08:02:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"541a46a5350621aabcf5dcf2766e7b68ad1fc9c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4494c43a66a311b3858feec5571b1603b5b68e8c","head":{"label":"clockfly:versionSuite","ref":"versionSuite","sha":"4494c43a66a311b3858feec5571b1603b5b68e8c","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror
