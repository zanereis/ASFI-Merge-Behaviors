Reduce input sequence size and batch size. Also other sizes was changed, they are taken from lstm test for onnx frontend\r\n2. Skip LSTM modification with projection. It is rare used and supported by pytorch framework only\r\n3. Skip tests which check onnx model LSTM modifications converted from pytorch model\r\n4. Weights are always randomly generated\r\nFor points 2, 3 and 4: the code was not removed, the paths to it were commented only. It can be switch on in the future if need  \r\n\r\n@masahi please review this patch\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-29T10:17:10Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T18:36:23Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T06:07:01Z","merged_at":"2021-07-30T06:07:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"97f147c254f1da6c1dfd1377cf4a9e530b72e2d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0N

pytest-xdist to paralellize CI jobs on worker nodes. The thought here is: right now our concurrency model in CI is to keep with 1 CPU to reduce debugging headache and run $(nproc) workers per CI CPU node. Meanwhile our CI is heterogenous so a long ci_cpu-bound step will negatively affect the overall runtime of all PRs. Going the other way, the idea is to run each CI job as fast as possible and let jobs pile into queues where we can see more clearly the bottlenecks. This means that when the queues are drained, devs get faster response times from the CI, and the CPU nodes should still be used optimally (or perhaps get a slight boost since caching may work better with fewer workloads).\r\n\r\nRestricting to 2 CPUs since this is a test; in the future, CI_PYTEST_NUM_CPUS should be used to actually control from Jenkinsfile.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @jroesch

follow-up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8466\r\n\r\nA new pass is added to merge multiple TIR-level dynamic shared memory allocations, whose sizes may not be a constant. This case is not handled by `storage_rewrite` pass. Rather than updating `storage_rewrite` pass, I added a new pass since the logic is simpler (we MUST merge and we know which alloc to merge).\r\n\r\nHetero-dtype is supported per discussion

The code from line 51 to line 53 should be like this,\r\n```cpp\r\n 51   if (((int)threadIdx.x) == 0 && (int)threadIdx.y) < 1) {\r\n 52     A_red[(((int)threadIdx.y))] = red_buf0[(0)];\r\n 53   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fix the reduction schedule\r\nAfter analysising the CUDA kernel, we can fix the schedule of all reduction ops in `python/tvm/topi/cuda/reduction.py`.\r\nI amend the code in line 89 and add a constriant to thread_y by the following code\r\n```python\r\nsch[real_output].set_store_predicate(\r\n            tvm.tir.all(thread_x.equal(0),\r\n                        block_x * num_thread + thread_y < reduce(mul, real_output.shape)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, since this bug can only be detected with `cuda-memcheck` tool, I think it is essential to add `cuda-memcheck` to tvm Github Action to avoid bugs like

discussion in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/te-compiler-device-type-error-in-updatemainworkspacesize/10536/5, the updated TE compiler has a different behavior as the old compile engine in terms of visiting each Relay function for compilation. Specifically, TE compiler now makes sure the function name is unique when it appears multiple times in a model. This breaks the current task extraction mechanism, which uses function name and TE compute hash as the key to de-duplicate tasks. As a result, the same task will be extracted multiple times, and all tasks have the weight 1.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes to resolve this issue:\r\n1. Change the type of `wkl_key_to_weight` from `Dict[str, int]` to `Dict[str, Tuple[int, Set[Str]]]`, mapping from a workload key to the weight as well as associated function names. In this way, we guarantee that functions with the same TE compute will be extracted once.\r\n2. Add `func_name_to_wkl_key`, mapping from the unique function name to its workload key. When TE compiler is used and `te_compiler_update_weights` is invoked, it obtains the workload key of the given function and aggregate the weights.\r\n3. Refactor unit tests to be pytest parameterized. Also improve the control flow test to have 2 identical Conv2Ds. Without this PR, this test will fail because it falls back to use VM compiler due to the control flow and extracts 2 identical tasks.\r\n\r\ncc @masahi @csullivan @jroesch @merrymercy

creates span information by print (`AsText`) and re-parse the IR. However, `GetUniqueName` in `AsText` renames identical variable names (say we have 2 `%p0`, `AsText` will rename one of them as `%p01`). Such behaviour makes themselves incompatible with some other passes (e.g., `DefuseOps`) which depend on information brought by original variable names.\r\n\r\nFor details, see

Even though the shape of tensor_a can be specified through `from_tensorflow(shape=(...))` and in this case the batch_size value must be a fixed number, we cannot process this as a static graph.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an extra parameter to `from_tensorflow`, that we can manually fix a tensor to be a constant value, then the graph can be processed as a static

Background and Motivation\r\nThis is the PR for this [RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/pre-rfc-dynamic-shape-use-sizevar-instead-of-var-when-convert-any-in-the-getshape-function/10625)\r\n\r\nCurrently, TVM uses `Any` to represent an unknown dimension when the input has a dynamic shape. When building the schedule for a Relay primitive function, the `AnyNode` will be converted to a `Var` named `\"any_dim\"`. However, an element in a shape array cannot be a negative number, and use `Var` to represent shape array elements will cause redundant boundary check because we cannot deduce the sign of a `Var`. For example, given a simple network with only a softmax operation like\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nfrom time import time\r\n\r\n# actual input shape\r\ndim0 = 2\r\ndim1 = 10\r\ndim2 = 8\r\ndim3 = 16\r\n\r\n# relay var shapes\r\nv_dim0 = relay.Any()\r\nv_dim1 = relay.Any()\r\nv_dim2 = relay.Any()\r\nv_dim3 = relay.Any()\r\n\r\n# rt settings\r\nexec_mod = \"vm\"\r\ntgt = \"cuda\"\r\ndev = tvm.device(tgt)\r\n\r\ndef get_mod():\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", shape=(v_dim0, v_dim1, v_dim2, v_dim3))\r\n    y = relay.nn.softmax(x)\r\n    mod = tvm.IRModule()\r\n    mod[\"main\"] = relay.Function([x], y)\r\n    return mod\r\n\r\nmod = get_mod()\r\n```\r\nThe corresponding tir looks like (here we show a part of the whole function since it is too long)\r\n```\r\nprimfn(placeholder_1: handle, T_softmax_norm_1: handle) -> ()\r\n  attr = {\"global_symbol\": \"fused_nn_softmax\", \"tir.noalias\": True}\r\n  buffers = {T_softmax_norm: Buffer(T_softmax_norm_2: Pointer(float32), float32, [any_dim: int32, any_dim_1: int32, any_dim_2: int32, any_dim_3: int32], [stride: int32, stride_1: int32, stride_2: int32, stride_3: int32], type=\"auto\"),\r\n             placeholder: Buffer(placeholder_2: Pointer(float32), float32, [any_dim, any_dim_1, any_dim_2, any_dim_3], [stride_4: int32, stride_5: int32, stride_6: int32, stride_7: int32], type=\"auto\")}\r\n  buffer_map = {placeholder_1: placeholder, T_softmax_norm_1: T_softmax_norm} {\r\n  attr [T_softmax_maxelem: Pointer(global float32)] \"storage_scope\" = \"global\";\r\n  allocate(T_softmax_maxelem, float32, [((any_dim*any_dim_1)*any_dim_2)]);\r\n  attr [T_softmax_exp: Pointer(global float32)] \"storage_scope\" = \"global\";\r\n  allocate(T_softmax_exp, float32, [(((any_dim*any_dim_1)*any_dim_2)*any_dim_3)]) {\r\n    attr [IterVar(blockIdx.x: int32, (nullptr), \"ThreadIndex\", \"blockIdx.x\")] \"thread_extent\" = floordiv((((any_dim*any_dim_1)*any_dim_2) + 511), 512);\r\n    attr [IterVar(threadIdx.x: int32, (nullptr), \"ThreadIndex\", \"threadIdx.x\")] \"thread_extent\" = 512;\r\n    if (blockIdx.x < floordiv(((any_dim*any_dim_1)*any_dim_2), 512)) {\r\n      if (floordiv(floordiv(((blockIdx.x*512) + threadIdx.x), any_dim_2), any_dim_1) < any_dim) {\r\n        if (floormod(floordiv(((blockIdx.x*512) + threadIdx.x), any_dim_2), any_dim_1) < any_dim_1) {\r\n          if (floormod(((blockIdx.x*512) + threadIdx.x), any_dim_2) < any_dim_2) {\r\n            if (floordiv(((blockIdx.x*512) + threadIdx.x), any_dim_2) < (any_dim*any_dim_1)) {\r\n              T_softmax_maxelem[((blockIdx.x*512) + threadIdx.x)] = -3.40282e+38f32\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n...\r\n```\r\nIf you look carefully, you will find some unnecessary if-conditions like `floormod(floordiv(((blockIdx.x*512) + threadIdx.x), any_dim_2), any_dim_1) < any_dim_1`. This is because `floormod` can have negative inputs. For example, `y < floodmod(x, y) <= 0` if `y < 0`. Since we do not know the sign of `any_dim_1` and the output of `floodmod` will be greater than `any_dim_1` if `any_dim_1 < 0`, a redundant if-condition will be added here.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI think currently we do not have the need for negative shape arrays.

the addition of tvm.testing._target_to_requirement pytest marks was handled by the parametrize_targets function.  The _auto_parametrize_target function assumed that a unit test that was already parametrized had all markings needed.  If a unit test was explicitly parametrized using @pytest.mark.parametrize, these marks would be missing.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this explicit use of @pytest.mark.parametrize('target', ...) should be avoided, but has value in the case of marking with multiple parameters with @pytest.mark.parametrize('target,other', ...).  This use case isn't yet supported by the tvm.testing.parameters function.

goal of this PR is to add float16 test cases to topi schedules used for ResNet50.  This PR is split up into independent commits, as described below, for ease of review.\r\n\r\n[Topi][Testing] Minor cleanup for python reference implementations\r\n\r\n- Use input dtype for dilate/conv2d accumulate in python\r\n  impl. Previously, the python implementations of dilation and conv2d\r\n  would use numpy default dtype in some cases, rather than the input\r\n  data's dtype.\r\n\r\n- Added fallback for datatypes not

C-style codegen, pointer types can be freely cast between scalar and vectorized types (e.g. `float16x4* <-> float16*`).  In SPIR-V, these are separate types, and no such casting is allowed.  This was previously handled by having a special-case for `Ramp(base, stride=1, lanes)` in the codegen.  That method didn't cover all possible cases, including Broadcast nodes used as indices.\r\n\r\nPointerValueTypeRewrite previously re-wrote the AllocateNode and parameter pointer types, but didn't update the Load/Store node.  This change tracks which variables can be updated to a vectorized type, and then updates all references to those.  This includes removing the `RampNode`, as the vectorization is then included as part of the variable type.\r\n\r\nThe existing behavior of the StorageRewrite pass, which uses much of the same code, is maintained, to avoid breaking codegen that relies on

#8234, a new op `nn.matmul` was added to extend `nn.dense` with transpose/non-transpose inputs support.\r\n\r\nThis PR is going to also extend `nn.batch_matmul` to support inputs to be in transpose or non-transposed format.\r\n\r\nSince the original topi schedule is still for NT format, I set the default format of `nn.batch_matmul` to be NT. And for the `qnn.batch_matmul` and some pass like `CombineParallelBatchMatmul`, I just left them to only support NT currently. Guys who are interested in these may continue to fix :)\r\n\r\nThings TODO in this PR:\r\n- [x] Add tf frontend support for NN batch_matmul(NN matmul supported has already been added)\r\n\r\ncc

now if we in TIR add a floating point type with an integer type, the integer type will be implicitly cast to the floating point type.\r\n\r\nE.g. `a: float32 + b: int32 ---> a: float32 + cast(float32, b: int32)`\r\n\r\nThis change does the same thing for floating point types. If we have two different floating point types e.g. fp16 and fp32, then when operating, the lower bit floating point type gets cast into the higher bit floating point type.\r\n\r\nE.g. `a: float32 + b: float16 --> a: float32 + cast(float32, b: float16)`\r\n\r\nThis is of use since https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8340 has an issue where some schedules which should support mixed precision types do not. This is due to binary ops like addition and multiplication not supporting mixing fp32 and fp16. Most of these errors can be fixed by inserting a cast into the schedule. \r\n\r\nRather than manually audit every schedule which might have this, this might be a preferable and reasonable

structure has an extra tir.cast compared the first, because the first structure print the 2.2 to tir.float32(2.2) and the tir.float32(2.2) is parsed to tir.cast(tir.float32(2.2), \"float32\") in second structure. So, we reduced the printing of tir.float32() wrapper.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when one operator is 2.0/3.0/4.0 (`(A[()] = tir.min(2.2, 5.0)`),  c++ ostringstream print it to 2/3/4 in default. When entering the second parsing, parser consider it as an integer,  `A[()] = tir.min(2.2000000000000002, 5)`, and report error:\r\nCheck failed: (a.dtype() == b.dtype()) is false: TypeError: mismatched types. float32 vs. int32. So we add the `os.setf(std::ios::showpoint);`.\r\n\r\nBut this method show the 2.0/3.0/4.0 to 2.0000000000000000 which has 17 bits precision value.This print is really not beautiful,\r\nPlease review and see if there is a better solution?\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-19T12:32:25Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T13:08:47Z","closed_at":"2021-07-22T13:03:53Z","merged_at":"2021-07-22T13:03:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"07243a89df3cdac6afaf29a74aba398190a76c72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zhiics","id":5145158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDUxNTg=","avatar_url":"https://ava

PR adds support for generating Arduino projects to microTVM. Using an arbitrary model as input, we create a bare-bones Arduino project that can instantiate and run inference on the model. The developer is then free to build their Arduino project using this functionality. \r\n\r\nHost-driven inference is not currently supported, but a future PR will add this functionality. Arduino support in this PR implements Project API, so this PR depends on #8380 and will merge afterwards.\r\n\r\n@areusch @mdw-octoml

outside of the image boundaries.\r\ntvm_output contains layer_out[\"output\"]. Its shape format is `[_,_,h,w]` (variable `data` in this PR)\r\nBut `_get_box` method signature uses  `lw, lh` parameters sequence. `_get_box(data, biases, n, location, lw, lh, w, h)`.\r\nThe fix maps `lw` to `data[3]` and `lh` to `data[2]`.\r\nThe problem was not detected earlier because vanilla yolov2 and yolov3 models network usually have the same Height and Width.

user recently noted that there are some issues importing some DLRM models generated by Pytorch in[ this thread](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/dlrm-onnx-strided-slice-in-loop-issues/10483). After investigating, I found that the problem is that Pytorch is generating loop nodes without proper output shape information, which causes us to use improper variable shapes. To fix this, we can instead do type inference on the loop body to figure out output shapes on our own.
