What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR blocks subquery expressions in lambda and higher-order functions, since these can generate incorrect results.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is safer to block these query patterns which can generate incorrect results for now.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdding support and tests for collated types in all the file sources currently supported by Spark, including:\r\n - parquet\r\n - json\r\n - csv\r\n - orc\r\n - text\r\n\r\nImportant to note is that collations metadata will only be preserved if these file sources are specified via the [CREATE TABLE USING DATA_SOURCE](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html) api. Just using the dataframe api to directly write to a file will not preserve collation metadata (except in the case of parquet because it saves the schema in the file itself).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo have collations be compatible with all file sources users can choose from.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users can now create tables with collations using all supported file sources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR brings the Java ServiceProvider Interface (SPI) Support for dynamic JDBC dialect registering.\r\n\r\nA custom JDBC dialect can be registered easily instead of calling JdbcDialects.registerDialect manually.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor pure SQL and other non-Java API users, it's difficult to register a custom JDBC dialect to use. With this patch, this can be done when the jar containing the dialect class is visible to the spark classloader.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, but mostly for third-party developers\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix a typo `slf4j-to-jul` to `jul-to-slf4j`. There exists only one.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep slf4j-to-jul\r\ncommon/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/Logging.scala:    // slf4j-to-jul bridge order to route their logs to JUL.\r\n```\r\n\r\nApache Spark uses `jul-to-slf4j` which includes a `java.util.logging` (jul) handler, namely `SLF4JBridgeHandler`, which routes all incoming jul records to the SLF4j

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSince Spark 4.0, the SQL config `spark.sql.parquet.inferTimestampNTZ.enabled` is turned off by default. Consequently, when reading Parquet files that were not produced by Spark, the Parquet reader will no longer automatically recognize data as the TIMESTAMP_NTZ data type. This change ensures backward compatibility with releases of Spark version 3.2 and earlier. It also aligns the behavior of schema inference for Parquet files with that of other data sources such as CSV, JSON, ORC, and JDBC, enhancing consistency across the data sources. To revert to the previous behavior where TIMESTAMP_NTZ types were inferred, set `spark.sql.parquet.inferTimestampNTZ.enabled` to true.\r\n\r\nNote: With https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47368 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47447, this behavior change won't break the current workloads which are using Spark 3.3/3.4/3.5.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Consistency with the behavior of CSV, JSON, ORC, and JDBC data sources. This also makes the schema inference behavior simpler.\r\n2. When using `insert overwrite` or `replace table` over external parquet files into a Delta or Iceberg table, the result schema is changed from TimestampType to TimestampNTZType. The result table can't be read by older version engines anymore due to a lack of TimestampNTZ support. The behavior change happens silently and it is hard for users to figure out how to fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, since Spark 4.0, the SQL config `spark.sql.parquet.inferTimestampNTZ.enabled` is turned off by default. Consequently, when reading Parquet files that were not produced by Spark, the Parquet reader will no longer automatically recognize data as the TIMESTAMP_NTZ data type.\r\n\r\nWith https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47368 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47447, this behavior change won't break the current workloads which are using Spark 3.3/3.4/3.5.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this pull PR we extend the Lexer's understanding of WhiteSpace (what separates tokens) from the ASCII: <SPACE>, <LF><TAB><CR> to the various Unicode flavors of \"space\" such as \"narrow\" and \"wide\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSQL statements are frequently copy pasted from various sources. Many of these sources are \"rich text\" and based on Unicode.\r\nWhen doing do it is inevitable that non ASCII whitespace characters are copied.\r\nThis results today in often incomprehensible syntax errors.\r\nIncomprehensible because the error message prints the \"bad\" whitespace just like an ASCII whitespace.\r\nSo the user stands little chance to find root cause unless they use possible editor options to to highlight non ASCII space or they, by sheer luck, happen to remove the whitespace.  \r\n\r\nSo in this PR we acknowledge the reality and stop \"discriminating\" against non-ASCII whitespace.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nQueries that used to fail before with a Syntax error, now succeed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new set of unit tests in SparkSQLParserSuite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

PR is a rebased and updated version of a [previous pr](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24801) by @etspaceman from 2019. This PR allows the spark kinesis library to work with localstack instances of kinesis.\r\n\r\nI have not added any changes to @etspaceman 's original code, except to remove the `cloudwatchMetricsLevel` value in the original PR, as subsequent PRs have added that same value in since.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the spark kinesis library allows you to override the kinesis endpoint, but not the dynamodb endpoint the kinesis consumer will use to manage leases. This PR adds that configurable url into the kinesis input stream builder.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLocalstack has only become more popular for integration testing since the original PR. Currently, one cannot use spark streaming and localstack kinesis together, as the kinesis consumer will only attempt to manage leases through a remote aws dynamo instance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis PR will allow the user to specify their own dynamo endpoint, much like how they can currently specify their own kinesis endpoint.\r\n\r\n### How was

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExample of aggregation sequence:\r\n```\r\ncreate table t(a array<string collate utf8_binary_lcase>) using parquet;\r\n\r\ninsert into t(a) values(array('a' collate utf8_binary_lcase));\r\ninsert into t(a) values(array('A' collate utf8_binary_lcase));\r\n\r\nselect distinct a from t; \r\n```\r\nExample of join sequence:\r\n```\r\ncreate table l(a array<string collate utf8_binary_lcase>) using parquet;\r\ncreate table r(a array<string collate utf8_binary_lcase>) using parquet;\r\n\r\ninsert into l(a) values(array('a' collate utf8_binary_lcase));\r\ninsert into r(a) values(array('A' collate utf8_binary_lcase));\r\n\r\nselect * from l join r where l.a = r.a;\r\n```\r\nBoth runs should yield one row since the arrays are considered equal.\r\n\r\nProblem is in `isBinaryStable` function which should return false if **any** of its subtypes is non-binary collated string.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo support aggregates and joins in arrays of collated strings properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it fixes the described scenarios.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new checks to collation suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn `SparkSubmit`, for `isKubernetesClusterModeDriver` code path, stop appending primary resource to `spark.jars` to avoid duplicating the primary resource jar in `spark.jars`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#### Context:\r\n\r\nTo submit spark jobs to Kubernetes under cluster mode, the spark-submit will be called twice. The first time SparkSubmit will run under k8s cluster mode, it will append primary resource to `spark.jars` and call `KubernetesClientApplication::start`  to create a driver pod. The driver pod will run spark-submit again with the updated configurations (with the same application jar  but that jar will also be in the `spark.jars`). This time the SparkSubmit will run under client mode with `spark.kubernetes.submitInDriver`  as `true`. Under this mode, all the jars in `spark.jars` will be downloaded to driver and jars' urls will be replaced by the driver local paths. Later SparkSubmit will append primary resource to `spark.jars` again. So in this case, `spark.jars` will have 2 paths of duplicate copies of primary resource, one with the original url user submit with, the other with the driver local file path. Later when driver starts the `SparkContext` it will copy all the `spark.jars` to `spark.app.initial.jar.urls`, and replace the driver local jars paths in `spark.app.initial.jar.urls` with driver file service paths, with which the executor can download those driver local jars. \r\n\r\n#### Issues:\r\nThe executor will download 2 duplicate copies of primary resource, one with the original url user submit with, the other with the driver local file path, which leads to resource waste.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen experimenting with SQL queries, it's common to accidentally leave a trailing comma after the last column in a table definition, resulting in syntax errors. This often happens when developers comment out the last column and forget to remove the trailing comma, leading to unexpected syntax issues when creating tables.\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses this issue by allowing trailing commas in column lists when creating tables, thus preventing syntax errors caused by inadvertent comma placement.\r\n```\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE test_tbl (\r\n    c1 STRING,\r\n    c2 INT,\r\n--    c3 INT,\r\n) \r\nUSING PARQUET;\r\n```\r\nI see no reason why the above query should fail.\r\n\r\nI explored a similar idea but for `SELECT` statement in #45541, but it turned out that making `from` a reserved keyword would break compatibility with older code using the word.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed because it's a handy feature already found in other databases like SQL Server and DuckDB. Bringing it to Spark would be a nice improvement for everyone.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, having a trailing comma will not result in a syntax error like it used to.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds DEFAULT_COLLATION configuration to `SqlApiConf` and makes sure literals are created with default collation. This PR also renames misused isDefaultCollation in the code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are needed to keep clean and consistent code. Also this is closely related to casting rules. Default collation is defined as session level collation and not as UTF8_BINARY. We had UTF8_BINARY as default previously as implementation does not call ICU, but the naming was not relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Users can define different default collation, but casting in functions is still not supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test to `CollationSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-19T13:50:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T12:47:52Z","closed_at":"2024-03-26T12:47:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cd2cead82acef08e142a9e51a6638e7c6033e2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9992694ffa9dc07a23c98491af0b0b02a760ab0f","head":{"label":"mihailom-db:SPARK-47431","ref":"SPARK-47431","sha":"9992694ffa9dc07a23c98491af0b0b02a760ab0f","user":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":756245919,"node_id":"R_kgDOLRNlnw","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailom-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to support ORC Brotli codec.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the master branch of Spark has used ORC 2.0.0 version and supports brotli compression encoding. ([SPARK-44115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44115))\r\nHowever, due to some hardcode checks in Spark, brotli cannot be used normally.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nset spark.sql.orc.compression.codec=BROTLI;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The value of spark.sql.orc.compression.codec should be one of uncompressed, lz4, lzo, snappy, zlib, none, zstd, but was brotli\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/orc/pull/1714\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nIn this PR, add the corresponding brotli

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a regression introduced by [SPARK-46633](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46633), commit: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3a6b9adc21c25b01746cc31f3b75fe061a63204c where one could not read an empty Avro file as the reader would be stuck in an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nI reverted the reader code to the pre-SPARK-46633 version and updated handling for empty blocks. When reading empty blocks in Avro, `blockRemaining` could still be read as 0. Call to `hasNext` status would load the next block but would still return false because of the final check `blockRemaining != 0`. Calling the method again picks up the next non-empty block and seems to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a regression introduced in [SPARK-46633](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46633).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a unit test to verify that empty files can be read correctly.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.shuffle.service.removeShuffle` for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.3.0, Apache Spark has been supporting `spark.shuffle.service.removeShuffle` via SPARK-37618.\r\n\r\n- #35085\r\n\r\nWe can use it when external shuffle service is available.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nBy default, no because `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` is still disabled.\r\n\r\nOnly for the existing shuffle service users, this PR works.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-18T20:23:45Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T00:10:47Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T23:58:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"207235d638cfb21122bf1a636bb92fcaa8cd96e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5eb9dedddab34be8180fdf4625bee19d83838e3f","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47448","ref":"SPARK-47448","sha":"5eb9dedddab34be8180fdf4625bee19d83838e3f","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Parquet TimestampNTZ type columns can be read as TimestampLTZ, while reading TimestampLTZ as TimestampNTZ will cause errors. This makes it impossible to read parquet files containing both TimestampLTZ and TimestampNTZ as TimestampNTZ.\r\n\r\nTo make the data type system on Parquet simpler, this PR allows reading TimestampLTZ as TimestampNTZ in the Parquet data source.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n* Make it possible  to read parquet files containing both TimestampLTZ and TimestampNTZ as TimestampNTZ\r\n* Make the data type system on Parquet simpler\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Parquet TimestampLTZ type column are now allowed to be read as TimestampNTZ\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `BlockManager` warn before invoking `removeBlockInternal` by switching the log position. To be clear,\r\n1. For the case where `removeBlockInternal` succeeds, the log messages are identical before and after this PR.\r\n2. For the case where `removeBlockInternal` fails, the user will see one additional warning message like the following which was hidden from the users before this PR.\r\n```\r\nlogWarning(s\"Putting block $blockId failed\") \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen `Put` operation fails, Apache Spark currently tries `removeBlockInternal` first before logging.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ce93c9fd86715e2479552628398f6fc11e83b2af/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/BlockManager.scala#L1554-L1567\r\n\r\nOn top of that, if `removeBlockInternal` fails consecutively, Spark shows the warning like the following and fails the job.\r\n```\r\n24/03/18 18:40:46 WARN BlockManager: Putting block broadcast_0 failed due to exception java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /data/spark/blockmgr-56a6c418-90be-4d89-9707-ef45f7eaf74c/0e.\r\n24/03/18 18:40:46 WARN BlockManager: Block broadcast_0 was not removed normally.\r\n24/03/18 18:40:46 INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Cancelling stage 0\r\n24/03/18 18:40:46 INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Killing all running tasks in stage 0: Stage cancelled\r\n24/03/18 18:40:46 INFO DAGScheduler: ResultStage 0 (reduce at SparkPi.scala:38) failed in 0.264 s due to Job aborted due to stage failure: Task serialization failed: java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /data/spark/blockmgr-56a6c418-90be-4d89-9707-ef45f7eaf74c/0e\r\njava.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: /data/spark/blockmgr-56a6c418-90be-4d89-9707-ef45f7eaf74c/0e\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's misleading although they might share the same root cause. Since `Put` operation fails before the above failure, we had better switch WARN message to make it clear.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a warning message change only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-18T18:46:20Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T19:40:22Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T19:39:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b21f8f8a3b3530a4c7c7bd3ca31226b778a35d86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45570/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45570/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45570/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc78d933d1b58d4005df06dd0abb3ee8ec6e7792","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47446","ref":"SPARK-47446","sha":"dc78d933d1b58d4005df06dd0abb3ee8ec6e7792","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently in python and scala the only way that user can create a collated column is to use `StringType` constructor which accepts int representing the id of the collation. We should not allow this and instead follow the SQL api by specifying the name of the collation instead of the id.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn order for users to be able to create collated columns outside of the sql api.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the new API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nWith new unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces support for Window Aggregates when partitioning is done against expressions with non-binary collation.\r\nThe approach is same as for regular aggregates. Instead of doing byte-for-byte comparison against `UnsafeRow` we fall back to interpreted mode if there is a data type in grouping expressions that doesn't satisfy `isBinaryStable` constraint.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPrevious implementation returned invalid results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes - fixes incorrect behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew test is added in `CollationSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, I propose a change in SQLQuery builder of MsSqlServer dialect. I override build method to check for boolean operator in binary comparisons and throw exception if encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMsSqlServer syntax prevents boolean operators in any binary comparison. Reasoning is lack of boolean data type in MsSqlServer.\r\nIt was possible to construct Spark query that would generate this situation in MsSqlServer and engine would throw syntax exception on the MsSqlServer side. This PR solves this bug.\r\nFor example, in table `people` there is a `name` column. In MsSqlServer if we try to execute:\r\n`SELECT * FROM people WHERE (name LIKE 'a%') = (name LIKE '%b')`\r\nwe would get a syntax error. However this query is fine in other major engines.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, user will not encounter syntax exception in MsSqlServer when writing these queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running a unit test in MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-18T12:55:36Z","updated_at":"2024-03-22T14:44:34Z","closed_at":"2024-03-22T10:44:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8aa76ffc2cb5ed37051fdefa8706ff738b40f3d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4cefb8cc387b37b08b032ebf2cef59bf64417e36","head":{"label":"stefanbuk-db:SQLServer_like_operator_bugfix","ref":"SQLServer_like_operator_bugfix","sha":"4cefb8cc387b37b08b032ebf2cef59bf64417e36","user":{"login":"stefanbuk-db","id":161319309,"node_id":"U_kgDOCZ2JjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161319309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":765608789,"node_id":"R_kgDOLaJDVQ","name":"spark","full_name":"stefanbuk-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefanbuk-db","id":161319309,"node_id":"U_kgDOCZ2JjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161319309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db/spark","description":"Apache
