Set logging level in order to vary verbosity\r\n```\r\n\r\n`BigQueryHook.get_pandas_df` uses `pandas_gbq.read_gbq` to query BigQuery and convert rows into Frames. Now `pandas_gbq.read_gbq` throws [the warning message](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-pandas/blob/v0.19.2/pandas_gbq/gbq.py#L905) if `verbose` is not None.\r\n\r\nAlso the version of `pandas_gbq` in Airflow GCP provider is [`latest`](https://github.com/RyuSA/airflow/blob/2663b177a666ee150f86bd16ad51526319fa7adb/airflow/providers/google/provider.yaml#L127). The project may fail when `pandas_gbq` removes the parameter `verbose`.\r\n\r\n## Any concerns?\r\nCurrently `pandas_gbq.read_gbq` seems not to handle the parameter. 👀 I believe this removal does not affect future releases.\r\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-pandas/blob/v0.19.2/pandas_gbq/gbq.py#L731\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

3.7 #30963, we incidentally create this block\r\n```python\r\n# Literal in 3.8 is limited to one single argument, not e.g. \"Literal[1, 2]\".\r\nif sys.version_info >= (3, 9):\r\n    from typing

airflow.typing_compat import Literal`\r\n\r\nIn additional `Literal` has [other known bugs](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Literal) which finally resolved in Python 3.10.1+, so personally I thought that better just use `from typing_extension import Literal` rather than out `airflow.typing_compat` resolver\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

`back-reference` command post-processes our docuementation to add redirections for new pages in the old documentation, so that user browsing the page can change version without hittin 404 error.\r\n\r\nThis command was not run in CI and some refactorings could break it (as it already happened in #33626 - fixed by #33790).\r\n\r\nMost other breeze commands are already run in CI, so this one should be no different.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds back-reference generation as part of our regular documentation building step.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under

Using template field argument for something other* than just setting it as a template field.\r\n2. A template field is defined for an operator but not set in the constructor as a field.\r\n\r\n### Scope \r\nWe'll check that defined template fields are directly assigned with a corresponding parameter with an identical name passed from the constructor.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nCreating a pre-commit Python script that will enforce the limitations below.\r\n\r\n### Added limitations\r\n1. Templated fields' corresponding parameters passed into the constructor must be named exactly\r\nas the fields. The following example is invalid, as the parameter passed into the constructor is not the same as the\r\ntemplated field:\r\n\r\n````python\r\n        class HelloOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\")\r\n\r\n            def __init__(field_a_id)-> None: # <- should be def __init__(field_a)-> None\r\n              self.field_a = field_a_id # <- should be self.field_a = field_a\r\n````\r\n\r\n2. Templated fields' instance members must be assigned with their corresponding parameter from the constructor,\r\neither by a direct assignment or by calling the parent's constructor (in which these fields are\r\ndefined as ``template_fields``) with a direct assignment of the parameter.\r\nThe following example is invalid, as the instance member ``self.field_a`` is not assigned at all, despite being a templated field:\r\n\r\n````python\r\n        class HelloOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\", \"field_b\")\r\n\r\n            def __init__(field_a, field_b)-> None:\r\n              self.field_b = field_b\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe following example is also invalid, as the instance member ``self.field_a`` of ``MyHelloOperator`` is initialized\r\nimplicitly as part of the ``kwargs`` passed to its parent constructor:\r\n\r\n````python\r\n        class HelloOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\")\r\n\r\n            def __init__(field_a)-> None:\r\n              self.field_a = field_a\r\n\r\n        class MyHelloOperator(HelloOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\", \"field_b\")\r\n\r\n            def __init__(field_b, **kwargs)-> None: # <- should be def __init__((field_a, field_b, **kwargs)\r\n              super().__init__(**kwargs) # <- should be super().__init__(field_a=field_a, **kwargs)\r\n              self.field_b = field_b\r\n````\r\n3. Applying actions on the parameter during the assignment in the constructor is not allowed. Any action on the value should be applied in the `execute()` method. For example, the following example is invalid:\r\n````python\r\n        class HelloOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\")\r\n\r\n            def __init__(field_a)-> None:\r\n              self.field_a = field_a.lower() # <- assignment should be only self.field_a = field_a\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhen an operator inherits from a base operator and does not have a constructor defined on its own, the limitations above do not apply. However, the templated fields must be set properly in the parent according to those limitations (currently not enforced by the pre-commit, see caveats).\r\n\r\nThus, the following example is valid:\r\n````python\r\n        class HelloOperator(BaseOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\")\r\n\r\n            def __init__(field_a)-> None:\r\n              self.field_a = field_a\r\n\r\n        class MyHelloOperator(HelloOperator):\r\n            template_fields = (\"field_a\")\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n* Creating an inheritance tree in AST using modules from different files is rather complicated; therefore:\r\n    * Detection of a \"base operator\" instance in the pre-commit is done by checking the parent's name ending with `BaseOperator` (simple string comparison).\r\n    * We assume that when calling the parent's constructor - then the parent's `templated_fields` are defined properly.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n- Using dynamic imports to handle inheritance caveats better.\r\n- Detecting if hooks are initialized in the constructors.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n- [X] Implement\r\n- [X] Add documentation\r\n- [ ] Patch existing operators with invalid template field definitions - will be done in separate PRs, after agreeing to the limitations introduced by this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

were still some left-overs of EAGER_UPGRADE in PROD image\r\nbuilding. Howwever \"eager upgrade\" only makes sense for CI images.\r\nPROD images when being built should use eager upgrades as they\r\nare produced in the CI image step.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n* removes eager upgrade parameters from PROD image\r\n* instead, prod image build has a new flag for installing\r\n  the images: --use-constraints-for-context-packages which will\r\n  automatically use constraints from \"docker-context-files\" if\r\n  they are present there.\r\n* modifies the CI workflows to upload constraints as artifacts\r\n  and download them for PROD image build when \"eager upgrade\"\r\n  has been used and directs it to use \"source\" constraints\r\n* adds back support to \"upgrade to newer dependencies\" label\r\n  that makes it easy to test \"eager upgrade\"\r\n* added `--build-progress` flag to easier debug long builds\r\n\r\nAs the result, when PROD image is build in CI:\r\n\r\n* when regular PR is run, it will use latest github \"source\" constraints\r\n* whwn \"eager upgrade\" PR is run, it will use the eager-upgrade\r\n  constraints that were generated during CI build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

However, this was changed to a default of 10 minutes `(waiter_max_attemps * waiter_delay)  = 100 * 6 = 600s = 10 minutes` (see [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/92cab74b280e9e7162120506c46fe275fbe0b577) where behavior changed). \r\n\r\nTo amend this, we:\r\n- Changed the default value for the `waiter_max_attempts` for the **ECSTaskOperator** from 100 to `sys.maxsize`\r\n- Removed legacy line which did not affect operator behavior\r\n- Edited tests to reflect changes\r\n\r\nThanks to @vincbeck for the input on the changes. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

#33698 \r\n\r\n- The All, Active, and Paused counts include deleted DAGs.\r\n- This situation arises due to the code's current approach of grouping all entries from the `dag` table, without specifically filtering for records with the `is_active` flag set to `True`. Consequently, this selection leads to inaccurate counts.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Marquez in their docs require PostgreSQL 12.1, but it seems to be working with Postgres 13 and 14 as well (but not 15). I can add this to the docs, but a better option may be to spin up a separate Postgres container (though this does significantly affect resourcing). Any thoughts on appropriately handling this?\r\n2. I was only able to get metrics to send by setting Breeze to install `2.7.0`. It did not work in the `main`. I'm not sure whether that indicates a bug in my configuration or a bug that has been introduced in the `main`.\r\n3. Marquez webserver conflicts with Grafana in that they both spin up on Port `3000`, so the standard mapping pattern of `2<port>` does not work. I opted for `23100` so that this PR did not break `--integration all`, but if there's another preferred pattern, it's an easy fix.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

the name suggests, this test should verify that a task is not adopted if it belongs to a DAG which is not in RUNNING state.\r\n\r\nBefore this change: the test setup creates a DAG in RUNNING state, but the test passes because the task has queued_by_job_id set to a live scheduler (so is not adoptable for a different reason - it's not an orphan). It looks like it was a copy-paste from the previous test case (test_reset_orphaned_tasks_no_orphans) which is supposed to test this scenario.\r\n\r\nAfter this change: the test setup is aligned with the test name - the task is an orphan but its DAG is not running so the task cannot be adopted.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/33694\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion I came to two conclusions:\r\n\r\n - `template_ext` causes a lot of confusion for users and is only covered under the documentation for custom operators\r\n - Its easy to disable `template_ext` by simply setting it after instantiation.\r\n \r\n Anyways, this PR adds some notes around template_ext alongside the other jinja templating docs, including a section about overriding rendering config or disabling rendering altogether.","created_at":"2023-08-25T16:57:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T14:36:59Z","closed_at":"2023-08-25T21:06:44Z","merged_at":"2023-08-25T21:06:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"a5aa16184d957ac0e4bfa4fdef15b32ffd312079","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:
