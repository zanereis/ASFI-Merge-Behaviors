This PR now fixes it without introducing new plugins / dependencies. The test was found to be flaky when running the following command:\r\n```\r\nmvn -pl gremlin-core \\\r\n    edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex \\\r\n-Dtest=org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.process.traversal.step.util.ParametersTest#shouldAllowNullValues \\\r\n-Drat.numUnapprovedLicenses=200\r\n```\r\nThe `params` array contains retrieved keys and value from a HashMap, that may lead to inconsistent test results due to the non-deterministic ordering of elements in a HashMap. \r\n\r\n### Proposed Fix\r\nThe expected keys and values are now stored in a new array 'expected'. Sort both 'params' and 'expected'. The comparison between 'params' and 'expected' has consistent

PR represents the second and final part of the changes to TraversalStrategies from [a recent dev list discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/xv235syvzgl06qcsqr0rrx8boch7ozjp).\r\n\r\nThis PR adapts `TraversalStrategyProxy` in Java to work based off of strategy names instead of strategy classes. This change allows the proxy to be used in traversals in order to pass custom/provider defined strategies and configurations into the gremlin script. The advantage of this approach is that the user does not need any concrete strategy class for custom strategies, and the only actions needed from a provider to support a custom strategy is to either register it for use with `gremlin-lang`, or add it to an import customizer for `gremlin-groovy`. The `TraversalStrategy` base class in python is similarly adapted to pass custom strategies into gremlin scripts.\r\n\r\nMy vote is VOTE

NullPointerException being thrown by outbound encoder due to null remote host which can happen with TLS 1.3 client certification auth failure. Client cert auth failure can happen after a successful handshake, causing an inbound SSLException. Changed the inbound handler to detect and store the SSLException in the channel attributes and changed the outbound encoder to detect if remote address is not available and there was an SSLException.

PR is based off of a recent [dev list post regarding changes to strategy construction](https://lists.apache.org/thread/xv235syvzgl06qcsqr0rrx8boch7ozjp) in response to bytecode removal.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not contain any changes related to adapting TraversalStrategyProxy to construct custom strategies, the changes here include fixes to allow TinkerPop provided strategies to be constructed and configured remotely, as well as the addition of feature tests for TinkerPop provided strategies.\r\n\r\nIn general, the feature tests don't have the granularity to verify the strategy is active and functioning correctly. The main intention of these tests is to ensure that the GLVs can use all expected strategies in both `withStrategies()` and `withoutStrategies()` and pass configurations where applicable. For each scenario, I generally tried to use a traversal in which the strategy will have an affect, although in most cases it is not verifiable that the strategy acted as expected. Testing of strategy behaviour is left to the pre-existing unit tests. I would like to extend these tests with scenarios which take advantage of `explain()` once [TINKERPOP-2128](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2128) is resolved.\r\n\r\nChanges included in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Add missing strategies to groovy's core imports, and the grammar's global strategy registry.\r\n2. Update groovy translator to escape '$' in string literals. Unescaped '$' indicates an embedded value in groovy's GString literals.\r\n3. Update python, .Net, groovy, go, and JS traversalStrategy translators to handle optional `new` in gremlin-lang strategy declaration. eg. `withStrategies(new ReadOnlyStrategy())` as well as `withStrategies(ReadOnlyStrategy())`\r\n4. Change signature of OptionsStrategy in python to be both more pythonic, and bear closer resemblance to gremlin-lang. For example, `OptionsStrategy(options={'myVar': 'myValue'})` has been updated to `OptionsStrategy(myVar='myValue')`\r\n5. Add missing strategies to python's strategies.py\r\n6. Add static `instance()` method to obtain ElementIdStrategy with default configuration.\r\n7. Updated ElementIdStrategy `getConfiguration()` such that `idMaker` is excluded from the config if it is set to the default id supplier. This ensures that configurations which do not override the default idMaker remain
