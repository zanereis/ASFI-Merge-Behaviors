<code>TemporaryFolder</code> has been fixed. See the published <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\">security advisory</a> for details.</p>\n<h1>Test Runners</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1669\">#1669</a>:](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1669\">junit-team/junit#1669</a>) Make <code>FrameworkField</code> constructor public</h3>\n<p>Prior to this change, custom runners could make <code>FrameworkMethod</code> instances, but not <code>FrameworkField</code> instances. This small change allows for both now, because <code>FrameworkField</code>'s constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1b683f4ec07bcfa40149f086d32240f805487e66\"><code>1b683f4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ce6ce3aadc070db2902698fe0d3dc6729cd631f2\"><code>ce6ce3a</code></a> Draft 4.13.1 release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/c29dd8239d6b353e699397eb090a1fd27411fa24\"><code>c29dd82</code></a> Change version to 4.13.1-SNAPSHOT</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1d174861f0b64f97ab0722bb324a760bfb02f567\"><code>1d17486</code></a> Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/543905df72ff10364b94dda27552efebf3dd04e9\"><code>543905d</code></a> Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/510e906b391e7e46a346e1c852416dc7be934944\"><code>510e906</code></a> Add sub headlines to class Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/610155b8c22138329f0723eec22521627dbc52ae\"><code>610155b</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b6cfd1e3d736cc2106242a8be799615b472c7fec\"><code>b6cfd1e</code></a> Explicitly wrap float parameter for consistency (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1671\">#1671</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/a5d205c7956dbed302b3bb5ecde5ba4299f0b646\"><code>a5d205c</code></a> Fix GitHub link in FAQ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1672\">#1672</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/3a5c6b4d08f408c8ca6a8e0bae71a9bc5a8f97e8\"><code>3a5c6b4</code></a> Deprecated since jdk9 replacing constructor instance of Double and Float (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1660\">#1660</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.8.1...r4.13.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.8.1&new-version=4.13.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

<code>TemporaryFolder</code> has been fixed. See the published <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\">security advisory</a> for details.</p>\n<h1>Test Runners</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1669\">#1669</a>:](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1669\">junit-team/junit#1669</a>) Make <code>FrameworkField</code> constructor public</h3>\n<p>Prior to this change, custom runners could make <code>FrameworkMethod</code> instances, but not <code>FrameworkField</code> instances. This small change allows for both now, because <code>FrameworkField</code>'s constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1b683f4ec07bcfa40149f086d32240f805487e66\"><code>1b683f4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ce6ce3aadc070db2902698fe0d3dc6729cd631f2\"><code>ce6ce3a</code></a> Draft 4.13.1 release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/c29dd8239d6b353e699397eb090a1fd27411fa24\"><code>c29dd82</code></a> Change version to 4.13.1-SNAPSHOT</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1d174861f0b64f97ab0722bb324a760bfb02f567\"><code>1d17486</code></a> Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/543905df72ff10364b94dda27552efebf3dd04e9\"><code>543905d</code></a> Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/510e906b391e7e46a346e1c852416dc7be934944\"><code>510e906</code></a> Add sub headlines to class Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/610155b8c22138329f0723eec22521627dbc52ae\"><code>610155b</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b6cfd1e3d736cc2106242a8be799615b472c7fec\"><code>b6cfd1e</code></a> Explicitly wrap float parameter for consistency (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1671\">#1671</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/a5d205c7956dbed302b3bb5ecde5ba4299f0b646\"><code>a5d205c</code></a> Fix GitHub link in FAQ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1672\">#1672</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/3a5c6b4d08f408c8ca6a8e0bae71a9bc5a8f97e8\"><code>3a5c6b4</code></a> Deprecated since jdk9 replacing constructor instance of Double and Float (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1660\">#1660</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.8.1...r4.13.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.8.1&new-version=4.13.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

<code>TemporaryFolder</code> has been fixed. See the published <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\">security advisory</a> for details.</p>\n<h1>Test Runners</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1669\">#1669</a>:](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1669\">junit-team/junit#1669</a>) Make <code>FrameworkField</code> constructor public</h3>\n<p>Prior to this change, custom runners could make <code>FrameworkMethod</code> instances, but not <code>FrameworkField</code> instances. This small change allows for both now, because <code>FrameworkField</code>'s constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1b683f4ec07bcfa40149f086d32240f805487e66\"><code>1b683f4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ce6ce3aadc070db2902698fe0d3dc6729cd631f2\"><code>ce6ce3a</code></a> Draft 4.13.1 release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/c29dd8239d6b353e699397eb090a1fd27411fa24\"><code>c29dd82</code></a> Change version to 4.13.1-SNAPSHOT</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1d174861f0b64f97ab0722bb324a760bfb02f567\"><code>1d17486</code></a> Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/543905df72ff10364b94dda27552efebf3dd04e9\"><code>543905d</code></a> Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/510e906b391e7e46a346e1c852416dc7be934944\"><code>510e906</code></a> Add sub headlines to class Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/610155b8c22138329f0723eec22521627dbc52ae\"><code>610155b</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b6cfd1e3d736cc2106242a8be799615b472c7fec\"><code>b6cfd1e</code></a> Explicitly wrap float parameter for consistency (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1671\">#1671</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/a5d205c7956dbed302b3bb5ecde5ba4299f0b646\"><code>a5d205c</code></a> Fix GitHub link in FAQ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1672\">#1672</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/3a5c6b4d08f408c8ca6a8e0bae71a9bc5a8f97e8\"><code>3a5c6b4</code></a> Deprecated since jdk9 replacing constructor instance of Double and Float (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1660\">#1660</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.8.1...r4.13.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.8.1&new-version=4.13.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

<code>TemporaryFolder</code> has been fixed. See the published <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\">security advisory</a> for details.</p>\n<h1>Test Runners</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1669\">#1669</a>:](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1669\">junit-team/junit#1669</a>) Make <code>FrameworkField</code> constructor public</h3>\n<p>Prior to this change, custom runners could make <code>FrameworkMethod</code> instances, but not <code>FrameworkField</code> instances. This small change allows for both now, because <code>FrameworkField</code>'s constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1b683f4ec07bcfa40149f086d32240f805487e66\"><code>1b683f4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ce6ce3aadc070db2902698fe0d3dc6729cd631f2\"><code>ce6ce3a</code></a> Draft 4.13.1 release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/c29dd8239d6b353e699397eb090a1fd27411fa24\"><code>c29dd82</code></a> Change version to 4.13.1-SNAPSHOT</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1d174861f0b64f97ab0722bb324a760bfb02f567\"><code>1d17486</code></a> Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/543905df72ff10364b94dda27552efebf3dd04e9\"><code>543905d</code></a> Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/510e906b391e7e46a346e1c852416dc7be934944\"><code>510e906</code></a> Add sub headlines to class Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/610155b8c22138329f0723eec22521627dbc52ae\"><code>610155b</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b6cfd1e3d736cc2106242a8be799615b472c7fec\"><code>b6cfd1e</code></a> Explicitly wrap float parameter for consistency (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1671\">#1671</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/a5d205c7956dbed302b3bb5ecde5ba4299f0b646\"><code>a5d205c</code></a> Fix GitHub link in FAQ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1672\">#1672</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/3a5c6b4d08f408c8ca6a8e0bae71a9bc5a8f97e8\"><code>3a5c6b4</code></a> Deprecated since jdk9 replacing constructor instance of Double and Float (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1660\">#1660</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.8.1...r4.13.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.8.1&new-version=4.13.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

<code>TemporaryFolder</code> has been fixed. See the published <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/security/advisories/GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp\">security advisory</a> for details.</p>\n<h1>Test Runners</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1669\">#1669</a>:](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1669\">junit-team/junit#1669</a>) Make <code>FrameworkField</code> constructor public</h3>\n<p>Prior to this change, custom runners could make <code>FrameworkMethod</code> instances, but not <code>FrameworkField</code> instances. This small change allows for both now, because <code>FrameworkField</code>'s constructor has been promoted from package-private to public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1b683f4ec07bcfa40149f086d32240f805487e66\"><code>1b683f4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ce6ce3aadc070db2902698fe0d3dc6729cd631f2\"><code>ce6ce3a</code></a> Draft 4.13.1 release notes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/c29dd8239d6b353e699397eb090a1fd27411fa24\"><code>c29dd82</code></a> Change version to 4.13.1-SNAPSHOT</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/1d174861f0b64f97ab0722bb324a760bfb02f567\"><code>1d17486</code></a> Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/543905df72ff10364b94dda27552efebf3dd04e9\"><code>543905d</code></a> Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/510e906b391e7e46a346e1c852416dc7be934944\"><code>510e906</code></a> Add sub headlines to class Javadoc</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/610155b8c22138329f0723eec22521627dbc52ae\"><code>610155b</code></a> Merge pull request from GHSA-269g-pwp5-87pp</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b6cfd1e3d736cc2106242a8be799615b472c7fec\"><code>b6cfd1e</code></a> Explicitly wrap float parameter for consistency (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1671\">#1671</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/a5d205c7956dbed302b3bb5ecde5ba4299f0b646\"><code>a5d205c</code></a> Fix GitHub link in FAQ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1672\">#1672</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/3a5c6b4d08f408c8ca6a8e0bae71a9bc5a8f97e8\"><code>3a5c6b4</code></a> Deprecated since jdk9 replacing constructor instance of Double and Float (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1660\">#1660</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.8.1...r4.13.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.8.1&new-version=4.13.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/57\">#57</a> - Added Archiver implementation (<code>JarToolModularJarArchiver</code>) that creates modular JAR files using the JDK jar tool. The implementation uses <code>java.util.spi.ToolProvider</code> introduced in Java 9, so if it is run on Java 7 or 8 the resulting archive will be identical to a one created by <code>JarArchiver</code> - the module descriptor is not going to be validated and no additional information (such as version, main class and packages) is going to be added.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/67\">#67</a> - Added ability to set the module version and main class of a modular JAR file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/83\">#83</a> - Added new protected method (<code>postCreateArchive</code>) to <code>AbstractArchiver</code> that is called after the archive is created successfully</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/87\">#87</a> - of Levan Giguashvili (<a href=\"https://github.com/odinn1984\"><code>@​odinn1984</code></a>)  Snyk eng team to fix a possible security issue.

Now Plexus Archiver uses pure Java implementations to deal with file attributes so the <code>useJvmChmod</code> is no longer used and it is just ignored. <code>Archiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>Archiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>UnArchiver#setUseJvmChmod</code>, <code>UnArchiver#isUseJvmChmod()</code>, <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger, boolean )</code> and <code>ArchiveEntryUtils#chmod( File, int, Logger )</code> are deprecated and are subject to removal in a future version.</p>\n<h2>:rocket: New features and improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-archiver/issues/51\">#51</a> - More specific exception for cases when there are no files to archive.
