Problem \r\n\r\nIn the test getSetUnmodifiableSet and getSetNullList, we use a set to intitialize our choice, and assume it will have the order with getDefaultModelObjectAsString to be [A, B], but this is not necessary true according to [Oracle's official document](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html#:~:text=It%20makes%20no%20guarantees%20as%20to%20the%20iteration%20order%20of%20the%20set%3B%20in%20particular)\r\n\r\nFor the test renderAjaxAttributes, we create the Json string from the AjaxRequestAttributes and assume the order of the fields in tests which is not true because it serialize from extraParameters which was a HashMap, which did not guarantee any order and will cause non-deterministic when we change the environments like JDK version. Also the LinkedHashMap is designed with specification to guarantee the order to resolve this kind of problem\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nUse LinkedHashMap\r\n\r\nThis problem had encountered and

Reproduce\r\nThis error can be reproduced with the [NondexTool](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) with the following command (you can try that without modifying the pom, but feel free
