we got a lot of build failed (and terminated) with core:unitTest failure. The failed messages look like this:\r\n```\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n[2022-09-14T09:51:52.190Z] \r\n[2022-09-14T09:51:52.190Z] * What went wrong:\r\n[2022-09-14T09:51:52.190Z] Execution failed for task ':core:unitTest'.\r\n[2022-09-14T09:51:52.190Z] > Process 'Gradle Test Executor 128' finished with non-zero exit value 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, I found one reason of it (maybe there are other reasons). In  `BrokerMetadataPublisherTest#testReloadUpdatedFilesWithoutConfigChange` test, we created logManager twice, but when cleanup, we only close one of them. So, there will be a log cleaner keeping running. But during this time, the temp log dirs are deleted, so it will `Exit.halt(1)`, and got the error we saw in gradle, like this code did when we encounter IOException in all our log dirs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfatal(s\"Shutdown broker because all log dirs in ${logDirs.mkString(\", \")} have failed\")\r\nExit.halt(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, why does it sometimes pass, sometimes failed? Because during test cluster close, we shutdown broker first, and then other components. And the log cleaner is triggered in an interval. So, if the cluster can close fast enough, and finish this test, it'll be passed. Otherwise, it'll exit with 1.\r\n\r\nFixed it by mock log manager and other managers in mock publisher to avoid duplicate resource allocation. This change won't change the original test goal since we only want to make sure publisher will invoke `reloadUpdatedFilesWithoutConfigChange` when necessary. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

StandardAuthorizer to use a copy-on-write sorted array rather than a ConcurrentSkipList. The issue with the skiplist was that because it was modified while in use by StandardAuthorizer#authorize, we could sometimes expose an inconsistent state. For example, if we added a \"deny principal foo\", followed by \"allow all\", a request for principal foo might happen to see the second one, without seeing the first one, even though the first one was added first.\r\n\r\nThe sorted array data structure is more compact than the tree, although it has the disadvantage of needing to be copied every time it's modified. On the broker side, we can apply a batch of updates atomically now.

is a chance to cause deadlock when multiple threads access ClientRequestQuotaManager. In the version Scala 2.12, the lazy val initialization is under the object lock. The deadlock could happen in the following condition:\r\n\r\nIn thread a, when ClientRequestQuotaManager.exemptSensor is being initialized, it has acquired the object lock and enters the the actual initialization block. The initialization of 'exemptSensor' requires another lock private val lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock() and it is waiting for this lock.\r\n\r\nIn thread b, at the same time, ClientQuotaManager.updateQuota() is called and it has already acquired ReentrantReadWriteLock lock by calling lock.writeLock().lock(). And then it executes info(). If this is the first time accessing Logging.logger, which is also a lazy val, it need to wait for the object lock.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock happens.\r\n\r\nSince the lazy val initialization is under the object lock, we should avoid using lazy val if the initialization function holds another lock to prevent holding two locks at the same time which is prone for deadlock. Change to create exemptSensor during ClientRequestQuotaManager initialization with an expiration time of Long.MaxValue to prevent expiration if request quota is not enabled at that time.\r\n\r\n###

forwarded requests are not applied to any quotas on either the controller or the broker. The controller-side throttling requires the controller to apply the quota changes from the log to the quota managers, which will be done separately. In this patch, we change the response logic on the broker side to also apply the broker's request quota. The enforced throttle time is the maximum of the throttle returned from the controller (which is 0 until we fix the aforementioned issue) and the broker's request throttle time.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

fails when running on a machine with a Locale where decimal is represented by a comma. E.g. in locale of Germany, one point two is written as `1,2` and not `1.2` as with the default locale.\r\n\r\nThe test fails because it validates that each header has a corresponding value by assuming that comma is a separator between values & headers. This assumption fails for Germany Locale because comma could be part of a float number.\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\nThis change introduces a minor fix to change the validation. Instead of separating the attributes using a comma, now we use comma<space> as a separator.\r\n\r\n**Bonus fix**\r\nClose the stream after it is not

we may try to discover coordinator in both blocking (e.g. in `poll`) and non-blocking (e.g. in `commitAsync`) way. For the latter we would poll the underlying network client with timeout 0, and in this case we should not trigger wakeup since these are non-blocking calls and hence should not throw wake-ups.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm trying to fix it in a least intrusive way (a more general fix should be, potentially, to have two versions of `ensureCoordinatorReady`), since in our threading refactoring, the `ensureCoordinatorReady` function would not be called by the calling thread any more and only triggered by the background thread, and hence we would have a much simpler manner to ensure that non-blocking functions never throw wake-ups.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

flaky tests under OffsetValidationTest are indicating an underlying consumer duplication issue.  This is caused by [KAFKA-14024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14024) after switching the autocommit to async, and therefore causes the fetcher to move ahead without committing the previous offsets. The progress will be lost after partition revocation\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\nAdd an internal flag to stop the fetcher from sending fetches, for the partition to be revoked.  The reason we didn't use _pause()_ is because we don't want user API to interfere with the behavior, which might potentially introduce more bugs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

the first attempt to handle revoked tasks in the state updater we removed the revoked tasks from the state updater and added it to the set of pending tasks to close cleanly. This is not correct since a revoked task that is immediately reassigned to the same stream thread would neither be re-added to the state updater nor be created again. Also a revoked active task might be added to more than one bookkeeping set in the tasks registry since it might still be returned from stateUpdater.getTasks() after it was removed from the state updater. The reason is that the removal from the state updater is done asynchronously.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this issue by introducing a new bookkeeping set in the tasks registry to bookkeep revoked active tasks (actually suspended active tasks).\r\n\r\nAdditionally this PR closes some testing holes around the modified code.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

consumer group instance ID is used to support a notion of \"static\" consumer groups. The idea is to be able to identify the same group instance across restarts so that a rebalance is not needed. However, if the user sets `group.instance.id` in the consumer configuration, but uses \"simple\" assignment with `assign()`, then the instance ID nevertheless is sent in the OffsetCommit request to the coordinator. This may result in a surprising UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID error.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue on the client side by not setting the group instance id if the member id is empty (no generation).\r\n\r\n###

consumer group instance ID is used to support a notion of \"static\" consumer groups. The idea is to be able to identify the same group instance across restarts so that a rebalance is not needed. However, if the user sets `group.instance.id` in the consumer configuration, but uses \"simple\" assignment with `assign()`, then the instance ID nevertheless is sent in the OffsetCommit request to the coordinator. This may result in a surprising UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID error.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fix this issue for existing consumers by relaxing the validation in this case. One way is to simply ignore the member id and the static id when the generation id is -1. -1 signals that the request comes from either the admin client or a consumer which does not use the group management. This does not apply to transactional offsets commit.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

we encounter an error while processing metadata on the broker, we have a \"best effort\" strategy (log the error and continue). One problem with this is that the broker's metadata state (in MetadataImage) is no longer consistent with the quorum. If we take snapshots of this inconsistent MetadataImage, we would eventually truncate the bad parts of the log and lose the data forever. By preventing snapshots, we preserve the log to allow for some (future) remediation.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a simple boolean that gets set when we encounter a metadata error. The boolean can only be cleared by restarting the broker.","created_at":"2022-09-06T22:41:45Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T21:40:29Z","closed_at":"2022-09-12T21:40:29Z","merged_at":"2022-09-12T21:40:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2a2d448a950aabf0034bf24785169e1df42e8ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3883451fd20a94927d814cf287eed79ddb485c31","head":{"label":"mumrah:kafka-14203-disable-snapshots-on-error","ref":"kafka-14203-disable-snapshots-on-error","sha":"3883451fd20a94927d814cf287eed79ddb485c31","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

the QuorumController did not try to limit the number of records in a batch that it sent to the Raft layer.  This caused two problems. Firstly, we were not correctly handling the exception that was thrown by the Raft layer when a batch of records was too large to apply atomically. This happened because the Raft layer threw an exception which was a subclass of ApiException. Secondly, by letting the Raft layer split non-atomic batches, we were not able to create snapshots at each of the splits. This led to O(N) behavior during controller failovers.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both of these issues by limiting the number of records in a batch. Atomic batches that are too large will fail with a RuntimeException which will cause the active controller to become inactive and revert to the last committed state. Non-atomic batches will be split into multiple batches with a fixed number of records in each.","created_at":"2022-09-06T21:14:53Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T21:21:40Z","closed_at":"2022-09-08T21:21:30Z","merged_at":"2022-09-08T21:21:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"81b71c06f300daf353cef04653d59385db561b38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

Problem\r\nWhen consumer is closed, fetch sessions associated with the consumer should notify the server about it's intention to close using a Fetch call with epoch = -1 (identified by `FINAL_EPOCH` in `FetchMetadata.java`). However, we are not sending this final fetch request in the current flow which leads to unnecessary fetch sessions on the server which are closed only after timeout.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Change `close()` in `Fetcher` to add a logic to send the final Fetch request notifying close to the server.\r\n2. Change `close()` in `Consumer` to respect the timeout duration passed to it. Prior to this change, the timeout parameter was being ignored.\r\n3. Change tests to close with `Duration.zero` to reduce the execution time of the tests. Otherwise the tests will wait for default timeout to exit (close() in the tests is expected to be unsuccessful because there is no server to send the request to).\r\n4. Distinguish between the case of \"close existing session and create new session\" and \"close existing session\" by renaming the `nextCloseExisting` function to `nextCloseExistingAttemptNew`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nAdded unit test which validates that the correct close request is sent to the server.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this change has been attempted in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5407 but the PR was abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-05T13:34:30Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T02:31:29Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T13:53:10Z","merged_at":"2023-02-09T13:53:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"e903f2cd9646639cbada753a705b49fb903e1add","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12590/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12590/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12590/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ff731f1dc40bc8129f17cfee8c2c992237c25e65","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:KAFKA-7109","ref":"KAFKA-7109","sha":"ff731f1dc40bc8129f17cfee8c2c992237c25e65","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

utilizing the rack-aware consumer configuration and rolling updates are being applied to the Kafka brokers the metadata updates can be in a transient state and a given topic-partition can be missing

This seems to resolve itself after a bit of time but before it can resolve the `Cluster.nodeIfOnline` method throws an NPE.

did not match consumed position 3809\r\n\r\nOf the 3 consumers it spawned, only 2 were actually consuming data (maybe it is just this specific run), and the largest offset was actually

adjusted the invocation of the alter configs policy check in KRaft to match the behavior in ZooKeeper, which is to only provide the configs that were explicitly sent in the request.  While the code was correct for the incremental alter configs case, the code actually included the implicit deletions for the legacy/non-incremental alter configs case, and those implicit deletions are not included in the ZooKeeper-based invocation.  This patch adds a test to check for this and adjusts `ConfigurationControlManager` code so that the test passes -- the adjusted test is confirmed to fail locally otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe also add a log statement to emit any unexpected stack traces in the alter config code path.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

= LIKAFKA-44865\r\nLI_DESCRIPTION =\r\nWhenever the fetch session has a cache miss on the broker, the client logs FETCH_SESSION_ID_NOT_FOUND at the `info` level. This message isn't actionable to clients, and does not actually indicate an error. More accurately, it possibly indicates that the broker is sub-optimally configured. This change improves client-side logging by making this a `debug` log, and also improves the log message for this specific situation.\r\n\r\nEXIT_CRITERIA = N/A\r\n\r\nThis change does not affect behavior or control flow, only logging.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14015: A config provider (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-297%3A+Externalizing+Secrets+for+Connect+Configurations) that has dynamic reloading of secrets doesn't work as expected when Connect is run in standalone mode - i.e. tasks continue running with an older secret config value when the secret is rotated.\r\n- When a config provider needs to inform the herder that a connector needs to be restarted due to a change in a secret config that needs to be propagated to the connector and its tasks - it calls `Herder::restartConnector`\r\n- In the `DistributedHerder` implementation of `restartConnector` this works as expected where the connector is stopped, then started, and then if it's in the `STARTED` state at the end of startup - a task reconfiguration is requested. A task reconfiguration involves asking the connector to return a list of task configs (using the latest connector configs), comparing it with the running task configs and if a change is detected - write the new set of task configs to the config topic which will eventually result in the old set of tasks being stopped and a new set of tasks being brought up. \r\n- In the `StandaloneHerder` implementation, however, the step of requesting task reconfiguration is missing. This PR aims to fix this which should solve the issue in

the Incremental rebalance protocol does not allow a subsequent revoking rebalance when a worker joins right after one. This can lead to imbalance in assignments. See [KAFKA-12495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12495) for more details.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the above. Note that there already exists another PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367 to fix this. The main difference between the 2 approaches is that this one introduces an exponential backoff delay between 2 successive revoking rebalances. This is to dis-allow rebalance storms and still not wait for entire scheduled rebalance delay.\r\n\r\nNotable changes in this PR =>\r\n\r\n1) Allow successive revoking rebalances from the same leader.\r\n2) If there are successive rebalances, then we would introduce a delay between the 2 based on exponential backoff policy. This delay would be used using the existing delay/scheduledRebalance mechanism.\r\n3) The exponential backoff clock would be reset when the cluster reaches a balanced load i.e, there aren't successive revoking rebalances.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-26T10:11:35Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T14:08:07Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T21:26:22Z","merged_at":"2022-11-15T21:26:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"09da44ed80bd88e1ca4526a352a7b3d3e3899c37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/52d2381820780dfa9e7ed55e534f23303222e0b8","head":{"label":"vamossagar12:KAFKA-12495","ref":"KAFKA-12495","sha":"52d2381820780dfa9e7ed55e534f23303222e0b8","user":{"login":"vamossagar12","id":10499430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk5NDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10499430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12","html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222145451,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIxNDU0NTE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"vamossagar12/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vamossagar12","id":10499430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk5NDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10499430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12","html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vamossagar12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vamossagar12/kafka","description":"Mirror

the task manager stores the tasks it manages in an\r\ninternally. We recently extracted the code to store and retrieve\r\ntasks into its own class Tasks. However, the task manager creates\r\nthe Tasks object internally and during testing of the task\r\nmanager we do not have access to it which makes testing the task\r\nmanager quite complex.\r\n\r\nThis commit externalizes the data structure that the task manager\r\nuses to store and rerieve tasks. It introduces the TasksRegistry\r\ninterface and lets the Tasks object implementing TasksRegistry.\r\nThe Tasks object is passed into the task manager via its\r\nconstructor. Passing the TasksRegistry dependency to the task\r\nmanager from outside facilitates simpler testing of the task\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

preferred leader election should be allowed even if there are ongoing reassignments. Otherwise, it might result in unbalanced leaders if there are any long-running reassignments. For partitions being reassigned, a leader election will only be triggered when the TRS = ISR as part of the partition reassignment procedure automatically if the current leader is not in TRS or isn't alive (step [B3](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/f83d95d9a28267f7ef7a7b1e584dcdb4aa842210/core/src/main/scala/kafka/controller/KafkaController.scala#L699)).\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say there are broker `(1,2,3,4)`, and a partition is current on `(1,2)` , 1 is the current leader:\r\n- if we reassign that partition to `(3, 4)`, a leader election would be triggered during the reassignment step B3, and 3 will be the new leader.\r\n- if we reassign that partition to `(3, 1)`, leader election **won't** be triggered during the reassignment as the current leader is still in the TRS, 1 will continue to be the leader. The auto preferred leader election will help in such situation.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and
