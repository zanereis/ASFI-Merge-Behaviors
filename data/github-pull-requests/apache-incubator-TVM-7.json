PR udpates PagedKVCache to initialize one more page than specified via constructor. The reason is that applications usually depends the number of free pages (returned from `GetNumAvailablePages`) to decide the KV cache operation policy. If there is no this extra page, the KV cache will tell \"no available\" pages even when the last allocated pages are not full, which may give the applications an illusion that the KV cache is already completely full, and cause further issues.","created_at":"2024-04-05T17:54:49Z","updated_at":"2024-04-07T12:41:19Z","closed_at":"2024-04-07T12:41:19Z","merged_at":"2024-04-07T12:41:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"a7be540457d38aebf65cd36c3f0df3330921a376","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/20d9cacf8440ca149dcd55c97ea860d8718076da","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-04-05-kv-cache-one-page","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-04-05-kv-cache-one-page","sha":"20d9cacf8440ca149dcd55c97ea860d8718076da","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `ApplyPassToFunction` removed functions from the `IRModule` to hide them from the inner `ir.transform.Pass`.  The dangling `GlobalVar` references to those functions meant that the intermediate `IRModule` was ill-formed This commit updates the `ApplyPassToFunction` utility to instead replace the functions with `ExternFunc` nodes.  This still prevents the inner `ir.transform.Pass` from having visibility into functions that should not be mutated, but provides a well-formed `IRModule`.","created_at":"2024-04-03T17:30:40Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T18:21:56Z","closed_at":"2024-04-05T18:21:52Z","merged_at":"2024-04-05T18:21:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"9b5a7a457fc967bc38155abc1a71431603c76009","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5ce795768bd26eeb1a97439736711d7ed1615225","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_well_formed_apply_pass_to_function","ref":"relax_well_formed_apply_pass_to_function","sha":"5ce795768bd26eeb1a97439736711d7ed1615225","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `LLVMModuleNode` provided a `\"get_func_names\"` function that would return the names of functions available within the result of `tvm.build`.  However, this utility was not preserved across a round-trip through `mod.export_library` and `tvm.runtime.load_module`.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a similar `\"__get_func_names\"` function to a `DSOLibrary`, which returns the symbols available for use in the library.  This is exposed in the `Module.keys()` method, mimicking the interface that a Python user would expect.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this is used to improve the error message shown when a library does not contain the requested function.  The `difflib` module (from Python's stdlib) is used to find functions that are contained in the module, and have similar names to the one requested.","created_at":"2024-04-03T13:26:53Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:22:21Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T00:22:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/41a06622eb40b483145179cbde7f2de8a81d935d","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:runtime_allow_listing_of_runtime_module_functions","ref":"runtime_allow_listing_of_runtime_module_functions","sha":"41a06622eb40b483145179cbde7f2de8a81d935d","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR makes storage among different functions shared after cuda graph rewriting. Because CUDA graph cache storage, storage objects are not freed after function execution, this will increase memory usage if there are multiple functions. Making storage objects shared eliminate such overhead.\r\n\r\nIt also updates rewriting to prevent capturing storages and bindings used as function output. Previous we relies on the fact output tensors are allocated with `R.builtin.alloc_tensor`, however, this behavior changed after we enable storage planning for output tensor, which may also use

resolves a bug that was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16732.  If a rewriter function returned a no-op, and the pattern-match continued, then the `matches` provided to the rewriter function in subsequent calls would contain a variable to which the matched expression was bound, not the matched expression itself.  (e.g. For a match of `C = R.add(A,B)`, passing `C` to the rewriter instead of `R.add(A,B)`.)\r\n\r\nThis bug was caused by incorrect re-wrapping of `OrPattern` in `ExprPatternRewriter`.  Prior to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16732, all pattern-match results were populated by `ExtractMatchExpr`, and contained the result after applying `TryGetValOfVar`.  When re-wrapping the result of an `OrPattern`, https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16732 populated the additional matches with the result before applying `TryGetValOfVar`. This commit fixes the bug by applying `TryGetValOfVar`.","created_at":"2024-04-01T12:21:17Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T03:08:48Z","closed_at":"2024-04-01T22:23:35Z","merged_at":"2024-04-01T22:23:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"00395ae43d3d6024c900a32f512f136cf818a3af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16828/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16828/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16828/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/65ba7b88d6bcee9e52c7b608c9b17674c661ab50","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_bugfix_provide_full_expr_to_pattern_rewriter","ref":"relax_bugfix_provide_full_expr_to_pattern_rewriter","sha":"65ba7b88d6bcee9e52c7b608c9b17674c661ab50","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `relax.op.strided_slice` stored the `axes`, `begin`, `end`, and `strides` in the `CallNode::attrs`.  However, the attributes are only intended to store static values.  The indices used used for `relax.op.strided_slice` must frequently be in terms of symbolic shape variables, which should not be stored in the attributes.  While some utilities have special handling for `relax.op.strided_slice` (e.g. `tvm::relax::Bind`), many do not (e.g. `tvm::relax::WellFormed` and\r\n`tvm::relax::FreeSymbolicVars`).  As a result, the symbolic expressions in `relax.op.strided_slice` will fail to be updated in generic utilities, and will fail to trigger safeguards when this occurs.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the representation of `relax.op.strided_slice` to store all arguments in the `relax::CallNode::args`, rather than the `relax::CallNode::attrs`.  As mentioned in a comment from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13987, which initially implemented `relax.op.strided_slice`, this was an intended refactor once `relax::PrimValue` was fully supported.","created_at":"2024-03-31T15:04:11Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T14:12:48Z","closed_at":"2024-05-01T14:12:43Z","merged_at":"2024-05-01T14:12:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"20d769617fa6ab561d7ed2b7cd61ed2b6b4710ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3c244fbfc45f33526bcdba4cdcfff3f087c907cb","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_use_primvalue_for_strided_slice","ref":"relax_use_primvalue_for_strided_slice","sha":"3c244fbfc45f33526bcdba4cdcfff3f087c907cb","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces class `PagedKVCacheAuxDataManager` for PagedKVCache. This class manages all the integer auxiliary data required for paged attention and other KV cache operations, such as page table arrays, position arrays, etc..\r\n\r\nThe purpose of introducing this class is because prior to this PR, for each auxiliary array we issue a host-to-device copy. This may cause extra overhead, since these auxiliary array are usually lightweight. One simple idea is to \"merge\" all the auxiliary arrays into a single one, and taking slices of this large array for each original auxiliary array. By doing this, we enable to issue only one single host-to-device copy for the auxiliary arrays altogether.\r\n\r\nThe intrduction of `PagedKVCacheAuxDataManager` abstracts the interface that PagedKVCache copies host arrays to device arrays, enabling us to support both the previous way of copying and the new way.\r\n\r\nTo support slicing for attention-related TIR functions, we introduce `elem_offset` match in TIR functions in this PR.\r\nThis PR also bumps FlashInfer to support the auxiliary array slicing.","created_at":"2024-03-30T04:59:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T12:06:38Z","closed_at":"2024-04-01T12:06:38Z","merged_at":"2024-04-01T12:06:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"384b7f7a74453c4e5e2d2b01549b00314d20bac2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/476db33e18f21036c5be272f5f4eaf994ebdb5ef","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-03-30-kv-cache-aux-data-merge","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-03-30-kv-cache-aux-data-merge","sha":"476db33e18f21036c5be272f5f4eaf994ebdb5ef","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR fixes TVM loading errors when lower LLVM version does not support TVM predefined target tags.\r\n\r\nReport and related discussions are here: https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16425#issuecomment-2023292845\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Rationale:\r\n\r\n * During tvm load/initialization [list_tags()](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/83e7e9b2eb8dbeeb16dcfdbaf3336caa81071877/python/tvm/target/tag.py#L71) checks all ```src/target/tag.cc``` target definitions\r\n * The target tags **should be protected** against improper LLVM versions at their declaration time\r\n\r\n#### Other fixes:\r\n\r\n* Enforce the ```mcpu=generic``` [fallback assignment](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16808/files#diff-f13c79368edd27b0c05d044df267746187448906d4310d5617bce89003b8813bR230-R231), so LLVM will not noise us with improper invocation \r\n* Minor compilation fix for LLVM version ranges: ~~10~~ 11 < llvm < ~~16~~ 13 (introduced by SVE support)\r\n* Add a clear hint with LLVM_VERSION_STRING to the error message for the user\r\n\r\n\r\nCc

to this commit, the implementation of `relax::BlockBuilder::AddFunction` implicitly assumed that the input `IRModule` does not contain duplicate copies of the same function. This commit updates the implementation, removing the reliance on this assumption.  This commit resolves the error by tracking all `GlobalVar` that map to the same function, rather than an just one.\r\n\r\nA well-formed IRModule may contain duplicate function definitions. This is rare, as most functions can be disambiguated by the the function attribute `tvm::attr::kGlobalSymbol`.  However, private functions do not have this attribute, and a well-formed IRModule may contain multiple copies of the same function.\r\n\r\nThe regression test added in this PR calls `BlockBuilder::UpdateFunc` and `BlockBuilder::AddFunc` in a specific order to reproduce this issue.  In practice, this failure was sporadic, depending on the order in which a transformation pass visited functions in a module.  This was first observed in `VMShapeLower`, with sporadic errors depending on the order of iteration over

`tvm.ir.transform.ApplyPassToFunction` allows a transform to be applied selectively to some portions of a `IRModule`, without applying to the entire `IRModule`.  For example, to apply an optimization pass (e.g. `relax.transform.ExpandMatmulOfSum`) or an interface-altering pass (e.g. `relax.transform.BundleModelParams`) to specific functions.  It does so by generating an intermediate `IRModule` containing only the functions specified, applying the transform to that intermediate, then merging the results.\r\n\r\nWhen using `ApplyPassToFunction` to apply `DeadCodeElimination`, or a pipeline containing `DeadCodeElimination`, this intermediate `IRModule` may contain calls to `GlobalVar` instances that are not within the intermediate `IRModule`.  Prior to this commit, this resulted in an error being thrown when collecting the call graph. This commit updates `DeadCodeElimination` to instead handle incomplete call-graph collection.","created_at":"2024-03-27T12:53:07Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T15:28:03Z","closed_at":"2024-04-03T15:28:00Z","merged_at":"2024-04-03T15:28:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"545e0977e327aad3f60a110961bdef733d08dbb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d9096fc0dac638484bfde97811d4e4e735a1c7e2","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_dce_apply_pass_to_function","ref":"relax_dce_apply_pass_to_function","sha":"d9096fc0dac638484bfde97811d4e4e735a1c7e2","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `LazyTransformParams` function could be used to load model parameters on demand.

PR adds the automatic mode selection for customized all-reduce kernels, referring TensorRT-LLM.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this PR fixes a bug that may cause customized all-reduce kernel to hang forever. Prior to this PR, each worker resets its barrier values to 0 *after using all-gather to exchange their barrier handles*. Afterwards, the customized all-reduce kernels update the barriers of all workers. So it is possible that, worker 0 updates worker 1's barrier *before* worker 1 resets its barrier to 0. This lead to the all-reduce kernel hanging forever.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior to resetting barriers before all-gather, and forcing a device synchronization after reset.","created_at":"2024-03-26T14:45:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T05:30:10Z","closed_at":"2024-03-27T05:30:10Z","merged_at":"2024-03-27T05:30:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f889774ec10b56ebfac89f78698e06eb200db46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a937aeaf304454f403b4c0288c414f5d4bfa03c2","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-03-26-ipc-allreduce-auto","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-03-26-ipc-allreduce-auto","sha":"a937aeaf304454f403b4c0288c414f5d4bfa03c2","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the weights used by `nn.Module` instances were required to be `nn.Parameter` instances.  This commit allows the weights to instead be `nn.Tensor` instances, defined in terms of other `nn.Parameter` weights.  This allows a model to define both the original weights that would be present in an external checkpoint (e.g. a Pytorch or Safetensors file), and the\r\npre-processing that should be performed on those weights. \r\n\r\nThis is a re-implementation of https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16757, which was reverted in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16777.

PR fixes an issue in the dlight GeMV rule and the low-batch GeMV rule. The issue happens when the inner spatial loop has small length (e.g., in the MoE gate layer, this length is usually 8).\r\n\r\nThe error is because the GeMV scheduling does not make sure that each TIR block reads/writes the same number of local registers, and this inconsistency leads to wrong generated code. For example, in the schedule (prior to this fix), the first TIR block was scheduled to assign each thread 2 local registers, while the second block was scheduled to assign each thread 1 local register, which is incorrect. Unfortunately, this error only shows up when the spatial loop has small length.\r\n\r\nOne regression test is added.","created_at":"2024-03-23T23:00:35Z","updated_at":"2024-03-24T12:05:18Z","closed_at":"2024-03-24T12:05:17Z","merged_at":"2024-03-24T12:05:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"80bcf4cdb702f5d223e8f2a9de367b7be1250b3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1af0a0368a409bdddb2c413d3e7f52d7cb79f5ff","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-03-23-gemv-register","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-03-23-gemv-register","sha":"1af0a0368a409bdddb2c413d3e7f52d7cb79f5ff","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR cleans up the interface for the FP8 legalization passes by having them use the target attributes that are added by the `BindTarget` pass. This not only removes the need to pass the target as a parameter to those passes but also, in principle, allows for PrimFuncs with different targets to coexist and be handled correctly by the passes. Thanks to @Lunderberg for giving the suggestion.","created_at":"2024-03-22T02:15:06Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T00:26:35Z","closed_at":"2024-03-25T00:26:35Z","merged_at":"2024-03-25T00:26:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb08f0d57b5098a6edadad18ee058523087d81f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"csullivan","id":4804563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MDQ1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4804563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/csullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csullivan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d787fd4cb6aaa85c60073363f4d9ab18f04f43f6","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:fp8legalize-target-change","ref":"fp8legalize-target-change","sha":"d787fd4cb6aaa85c60073363f4d9ab18f04f43f6","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces API of kernel tuning for external runtimes like cuBLAS/cutlass.\r\n\r\nIt contains initial implementation of tuning algorithm for cuBLAS runtime. By default cublas uses heuristic based approach for kernel selection but in some cases it may be suboptimal, specially in case of kernels with dynamic shapes. Predefined collection of kernel descriptors (aka cublasLtMatmulAlgo_t) can allow to improve it.\r\n\r\nExamples of usage:\r\n```\r\nmod = partition_for_cublas(mod)\r\ndb = TuneCodegenAlgo(mod, codegen_name=\"cublas\")\r\nmod = relax.transform.RunCodegen({\"cublas\": {\"algo_db\": db}})(mod)\r\nex = relax.build(mod, \"cuda\")\r\n```\r\n```\r\nwith open(\"algo_db.json\", \"r\") as f:\r\n

PR introduces the lowering passes for GPU IPC memory and all-reduce. It contains the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. a pass `IPCAllreduceRewrite` which rewrites `\"runtime.disco.allreduce\"` to `\"runtime.disco.cuda_ipc.custom_allreduce\"`, and rewrites the storage scopes of the all-reduce inputs's from \"global\" to \"ipc_memory\" accordingly.\r\n\r\n2. memory planning enhancement, making the planning be aware of storage scopes. So each storage scope will be planned independently.\r\n\r\n3. a pass `LowerGPUIPCAllocStorage` that rewrites the storage allocation of IPC memory from builtin ops to calls to function `\"runtime.disco.cuda_ipc.alloc_storage\"`.\r\n\r\n4. supports the op `relax.builtin.alloc_tensor` with storage scope. The default storage scope is `\"global\"`.\r\n\r\nWe write the new passes in Python for experiment and fast development. These are good demos showing we can have efficient development with the architecture enabled by

to this commit, `tvm.ir.assert_structural_equal` would highlight an entire `relax::BindingBlock` if the number of elements in the binding block differs.  This can result in the entire Relax function being highlighted, making it difficult to identify the location of the mismatch.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the following changes, to improve the error messages that occur when `tvm.ir.assert_structural_equal` raises an exception.\r\n\r\n- In `\"node.StructuralEqual\"`, set `defer_fails = true` when `assert_mode` is true.  This highlights the first mismatch of an `Array<relax::Binding>`, rather than the entire array, in cases where the LHS and RHS have different sizes.\r\n\r\n- In the `SHashReduce` for `VarBinding` and `MatchCast`, visit the value first, and then the variable to which it is bound.  This highlights the mismatched expression, rather than mismatches in the resulting struct info.\r\n\r\n- In `SEqualHandlerDefault::Impl::SEqualReduce`, defer the failure if enabled.  This highlights the first mismatch, which may also have been deferred, rather than an early return a later mismatch occurs involving `NullOpt`.","created_at":"2024-03-20T14:21:43Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T13:42:55Z","closed_at":"2024-03-26T13:26:52Z","merged_at":"2024-03-26T13:26:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf2d43e314ca7e682ae26dca70ada657054f8786","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16756/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16756/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16756/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0050cbccd0f1283c3a9df8809de0c50ea78b1cb2","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:ir_improve_highlighting_assert_structural_equal","ref":"ir_improve_highlighting_assert_structural_equal","sha":"0050cbccd0f1283c3a9df8809de0c50ea78b1cb2","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this PR, module \"psutil\" is imported at the top level of the disco process pool. The pool will try to kill all the processes at the time of destruction (when `__del__` is implicitly invoked). The `__del__` function eventually calls into a function that uses `pstuil`. But it is possible that the top-level `psutil` has already been released by Python, which leads to a KeyError as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException ignored in: <function DiscoPopenWorker.__del__ at

PR introduces the CUDA IPC memory support in TVM runtime. IPC memory allows multiple distribtued workers accessing the GPU memory of each other directly. This functionality is helpful for implementing customzied communication primitives across distributed workers.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we bring the customized all-reduce implementation from TensorRT-LLM into 3rdparty. This all-reduce implementation makes use of the CUDA IPC memory. We expose the all-reduce function in global function under namespace `tvm::runtime::disco::cuda_ipc`.\r\n\r\nOne unit test for the customized all-reduce kernel over two workers is added.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Hongyi Jin
