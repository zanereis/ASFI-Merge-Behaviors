This led to some sharp edges for users - e.g. if Foo had a registered schema.\r\n\r\nPCollection<Foo> = readFoo();\r\n\r\nWould infer the correct SchemaCoder for Foo. However\r\n\r\nPCollection<Iterable<Foo>> = readAllFoos();\r\n\r\nWould not search for a schema, and instead take whatever Coder accepted Foo (possibly SerializableCoder). This led to a lot of confusion for users.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the schema lookup continues while inspecting type parameters.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR touches many files due to a new parameter added to CoderRegistry(), however the vast majority of those changes are trivial.","created_at":"2024-10-08T22:35:53Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T18:09:45Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T18:09:45Z","merged_at":"2024-10-09T18:09:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"c243491254896e039e912662e4cfbe4bd38c766f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/32705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/32705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/32705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c7cec89dfca7ecf838d910dab31b18e2805b0e66","head":{"label":"reuvenlax:schema_inference_parameterized_types","ref":"schema_inference_parameterized_types","sha":"c7cec89dfca7ecf838d910dab31b18e2805b0e66","user":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72963016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Mjk2MzAxNg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"reuvenlax/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

of #31663 for release 2.60 \r\n\r\nAddresses Bug #32697\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit efee92bf02b55bee86848a9d0d291de58cb8412a.\r\n\r\nSpecific cause:\r\n\r\nSpanner has a max number of 400 sessions in a session pool, where a session is used for a read or a write operation.\r\n\r\nWhen using streaming pipelines on Dataflow with a high degree of parallelisation, where each work item can be reading from and writing to spanner, Dataflow will have up to 300 threads per worker, which potentially means 300 simultaneous read sessions, and 300 simultaneous downstream writes.\r\n\r\nIn some scenarios, this can lead to session pool exhaustion, followed by a worker failing due to this flag.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

addresses #20685.\r\n\r\nImplementation notes:\r\n1. Manually cast hive `Date` values to `Instant`'s in HCatToRow.java per my understanding of damccorm's suggestions in the issue above.\r\n2. I test this currently in `testReadHCatalogDateType` by writing a test hcatalog with a date column, reading it then, and converting the HCatRecord collection to a Row collection.\r\n\r\nI aimed to make the least invasive change, since the issue appears to be specific to hive.\r\n\r\nSome other notes:\r\n- The issue original backtrace deals with `java.sql.Date`, which I wasn't able to reproduce fully. I could only write hcatalog with `org.apache.hadoop.hive.common.type.Date`, so I'm not really sure if we wanna account for `java.sql.Date` case as well.\r\n- On this note, 267f76f3c2036c27dcbc94c563ecd1a2d4481f65 changed the code involved so that there's a direct cast to `AbstractInstant` in RowUtils.java. This doesn't change much, but jfyi.\r\n\r\n_Checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:_\r\n - [x] _Mention the appropriate issue in your description_\r\n - [x] _Update

of how vLLM does batching, it is much more efficient if you're able to push as many requests to it as possible so that it can make the appropriate batching decision. Right now, per worker thread we send requests serially; this fixes that inefficiency by sending all data asynchronously to the vLLM server and then awaiting the response.\r\n\r\nFixes #32528\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

writing to Iceberg, we need to write just one manifest file per snapshot.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are currently writing one manifest file per bundle (or one per GIB batch for streaming writes), which is a lot more frequent than needed. In medium/large streaming jobs, we can end up with thousands of extra manifest files. For an Iceberg table, the effect of this inefficiency is felt in two ways:\r\n- Writing more files than necessary\r\n- During query planning, having to open and read more files than necessary \r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nContinue writing bundles/batches to **data files**, but stop writing manifest files at that frequency. Instead, group data files by destination then write and commit just one manifest file per destination. Essentially, the number of manifest files should be 1-1 with snapshots/commits (currently, it's roughly 1-1 with data files).","created_at":"2024-10-05T23:05:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T20:16:51Z","closed_at":"2024-10-08T20:16:51Z","merged_at":"2024-10-08T20:16:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9aa996fd5c9579b2ac1f9e11db539daf60e5b02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1839326366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM5MzI2MzY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/build","name":"build","color":"cf8af7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32656\r\n\r\nThis change adds a mutex to the artifacts variable in the grpc server for the jobservices in the Prism runner within the Go SDK. In general, maps in Go are not thread safe so 2 concurrent grpc requests that read/write from any of the handlers, notably `/ArtifactRetrievalService.ResolveArtifacts` `/ArtifactStagingService.ReverseArtifactRetrievalService` handlers will trigger a race condition. This generally is not visible unless you have a test with the race detector enabled.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

job status response size exceeding some internal limit, thus affecting visual / functionality relied on metrics (job progress, other user counter, etc). Symptom includes progress bar stall for batch job, user counter increment incomplete or dropped, etc\r\n\r\nUntil Beam and/or backend can handle and/or guard from large number of metrics, this PR mitigate the issue by only report bucket level Lineage\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

auto-sharding to Iceberg streaming writes using GroupIntoBatches.\r\n\r\nIn streaming writes, bundles are often very small and can even be single-elements. We write each bundle to a file, so this can behavior can lead to many small files.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we group records into batches set by a triggering frequency (as well as record and byte size limits). Now, the number of written data files is more easily controlled. Essentially, every triggering frequency duration, roughly N data files are written, where N is the number of concurrent DoFns. To decrease the number of written files, one can increase their triggering frequency or reduce their parallelism.","created_at":"2024-10-01T13:28:47Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T18:54:50Z","closed_at":"2024-10-04T05:11:09Z","merged_at":"2024-10-04T05:11:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"d84cfffd017342542cc1dc3e7ae30452a485e3b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1839326366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM5MzI2MzY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/build","name":"build","color":"cf8af7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

combine_fn in PrecombineFn and PostCombineFn to avoid sharing state between lifted stages when using cloudpickle.\r\n\r\nPreviously PrecombineFn and PostCombineFn  assign setup, create_accumulator attributes as references the setup, create_accumulator methods on the original combine_fn [1] passed to _CombinePerKeyWithHotKeyFanout.\r\n\r\nWhen using cloudpickler with combiner lifting Precombine is split into ExtractOutputs/Merge stages in the case of FnApiRunner and as a result if these stages run in the same process the state is shared. Similarly when the BundleBasedDirectRunner is used the Precombine is split into PartialGroupByKeyCombiningValues and FinishCombine, both invoking the setup  [2][3] and teardown method.\r\n\r\n This change ensures a new instance of the combine_fn is used in the lifted stages when using cloudpickler.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/e705e28ecfddf2fbbc560339e8c5032fc771afe8/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L3166\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/e705e28ecfddf2fbbc560339e8c5032fc771afe8/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/direct/helper_transforms.py#L62\r\n[3] https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/e705e28ecfddf2fbbc560339e8c5032fc771afe8/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/direct/helper_transforms.py#L101\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this change, streaming pipelines that use the Java variant of WriteToJson would fail with error:\r\n```\r\nValueError: Error apply transform \"WriteToJson\" at line 16: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Must use windowed writes when applying WriteFiles to an unbounded PCollection\r\n```\r\neven when Windowing is explicitly set.

Guidance to incorporate the Github Release into the validation process.\r\n\r\n* The main change is that once the RC is ready, we publish the pre-release page (no longer draft, not yet latest).\r\n* Includes linking to the Github Release page from the Vote email template.\r\n* This allows review of the Github Release description during validation and vote, and public access to the pre-release assets.\r\n* Update contributor one-liner to produce comma separated names instead of newline separated names. This avoids the list of names dominating the blog post content.\r\n* Emphasizes updating the GitHub release with the final release tag, not simply leaving it as the RC forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

parent thread state sampler available in child thread when running ParDo#with_exception_handling(timeout).\r\n\r\n- ParDo#with_exception_handling(timeout) executes the DoFn in a new thread [1]\r\n- Incrimenting a counter invokes tries to access the state sampler that was declared in the main thread local storage from the child thread [2]\r\n- Since the child thread does not have access to the state sampler from the main thread the get_current_tracker method fails silently [3] and the counter isnt actually incremented\r\n\r\nThis change makes the parent thread's state sampler available to the child thread.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/1eddbdca4c5efe4bfccc11af29624f9689ea2997/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L2599\r\n[2]
