client-server calls to execute functions e.g. `onRegion()`, `onServer()` are retried an infinite number of times. In cases where `CLIENT_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT` is set and triggered, a (infinite) cascade of retries can cause high server resource consumption.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to correct that situation so that in every case, the number of retries is finite.\r\n\r\nWe aimed to make the smallest product code change possible (and still fix the bugs). This was made harder by tons of duplication in the product code. These are the product classes we modified:\r\n\r\n- `ExecuteFunctionOp`: used by `onServer()`\r\n- `ExecuteRegionFunctionOp`: used by `onRegion()` when no metadata is available\r\n- `ExecuteRegionFunctionSingleHopOp`: used by `onRegion()` when metadata is available\r\n- `SingleHopClientExecutor`: used by `ExecuteRegionFunctionSingleHopOp`\r\n\r\nWe have added a pretty comprehensive unit test that covers `execute()` and `reexecute()` logic (much of it duplicated) across those four product classes.\r\n\r\nWe have also added a `DUnit` test that covers that same `execute()` and `reexecute()` logic across lots of different (`onServer()`, `onRegion()`, ...) scenarios e.g. with/without metadata. That test exercises logic in `ServerRegionProxy`, particularly the overloaded `executeFunction()` method.\r\n\r\nA sister-ticket (and PR) [GEODE-6798](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-6798) tackle a deeper refactoring of these four product classes to eliminate the redundancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

some of the changes made when deleting the in-house JSON\r\nimplementation (`TypedJson`) to the jackson library\r\n(`QueryResultFormatter`) to restore the backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n- Added new unit tests.\r\n- Added tests to verify the actual JSON document generated.\r\n- Everything is serialized as JSON array with 2 elements: type & value.\r\n- Internal class names are hidden in the JSON document, public\r\n  interfaces are included instead.\r\n- Beans and primitive types only use the standard format when they are\r\n  not being serialized as part of an array, in which case the type is\r\n  ignored as it's already been serialized as 'ArrayElementType[]'.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we

corrects elder init processing to use the isCloseInProgress to\r\ncheck for shutdown.  A coding error during refactoring caused it to check the\r\nisCloseInProgress() method, which did more than just return the value of\r\nthe isCloseInProgress variable and was incorrectly reporting a close in progress\r\nduring startup operations.\r\n\r\nI've renamed the old isCloseInProgress() method to avoid similar coding\r\nerrors in the future and added a new implementation that merely returns\r\nthe value of the field, as you'd expect it to do.\r\n\r\nWhile writing tests I found that the ClusterElderManagerTest was leaving\r\nblocked threads behind because the waitForElder() method in\r\nClusterElderManager was not interruptable.  I've changed that method to\r\nbe interruptable.  We don't interrupt message-processing threads so this\r\nshould be a safe change.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
