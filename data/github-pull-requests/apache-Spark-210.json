What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes Executor to load jars and files added by --jars and --files on Executor initialization.\r\nTo avoid downloading those jars/files twice, they are assosiated with `startTime` as their uploaded timestamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExecutorPlugin can't work with Standalone Cluster and Kubernetes\r\nwhen a jar which contains plugins and files used by the plugins are added by --jars and --files option with spark-submit.\r\n\r\nThis is because jars and files added by --jars and --files are not loaded on Executor initialization.\r\nI confirmed it works with YARN because jars/files are distributed as distributed cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. jars/files added by --jars and --files are downloaded on each executor on initialization.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new testcase.","created_at":"2020-06-28T18:48:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-14T22:12:59Z","closed_at":"2020-08-14T22:11:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85864b40e395a17817fe8ac35d1451a96ad44de8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e57d053990e634fc6f03afbea761a9f32eeaee89","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-plugin-issue","ref":"fix-plugin-issue","sha":"e57d053990e634fc6f03afbea761a9f32eeaee89","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

In the current implementation, a single object lock easily leads to heavy contention in a busy Spark thrift-server. Replace to single read-write lock could be benefited. But a heavy holding on the write lock would still impact many operations even though they are submitted by different users.\r\nSo we use a `ReadWriteLock` for each database instead of one synchronized block to improve the performance.\r\n\r\nThe multiple read-write reentrant locks are divided by different databases. Only operations applied in the same database name could share a same lock. I checked all operations, there is no one operation and its callers need two write locks. Since it's a reentrant lock, it's ok that the method `renamePartitions` which calls `alterPartitions` will re-enter the same write lock.\r\n\r\n2. Change the `shim` in `HiveClientImpl` to thread-local and remove the cached `Hive`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn `HiveExternalCatalog`, all metastore operations are synchronized by a same object lock. In a heavy traffic Spark thriftserver or Spark Driver, users's queries may be stuck by any a long operation.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user is accessing a table which contains mass partitions, the operation `loadDynamicPartitions()` holds the object lock for a long time. All queries are blocking to wait for the lock. From the thread dump stack, `Thread-61500` was holding the object lock with a high frequency as mass partitions table access, this lead to many queries stuck.\r\n```\r\n61500

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the case of Full Outer Joins of large tables, in the presence of data skew around the join keys for either of the joined tables, OOMs exceptions occur. While its possible to increase the heap size to workaround, Spark should be resilient to such issues as skews can happen arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n[SPARK-24985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24985) changed `SortMergeJoinExec` to use `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray` on `SortMergeFullOuterJoinScanner`. But its performance is very poor, because when matching the key, you need to constantly get the element at the specified position according to the index.\r\nThis PR add a `FileBasedAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray`. It can quickly locate the corresponding data according to the given index because of the offsets array in memory. And in memory buffer rows can be limited by `spark.sql.sortMergeJoinExec.buffer.in.memory.threshold`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd American timezone during timestamp_seconds doctest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`timestamp_seconds` doctest in `functions.py` used default timezone to get expected result\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> time_df = spark.createDataFrame([(1230219000,)], ['unix_time'])\r\n>>> time_df.select(timestamp_seconds(time_df.unix_time).alias('ts')).collect()\r\n[Row(ts=datetime.datetime(2008, 12, 25, 7, 30))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when we have a non-american timezone, the test case will get different test result.\r\n\r\nFor example, when we set current timezone as `Asia/Shanghai`, the test result will be \r\n\r\n```\r\n[Row(ts=datetime.datetime(2008, 12, 25, 23, 30))]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo no matter where we run the test case ,we will always get the expected permanent result if we set the timezone on one specific area.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen you use floats in the index of pandas, it creates a Spark DataFrame with a wrong result as below when Arrow is enabled:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pandas as pd\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3]}, index=[2., 3., 4.])).show()\r\n+---+\r\n|  a|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because direct slicing uses the value as index when the index contains floats:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3]}, index=[2., 3., 4.])[2:]\r\n     a\r\n2.0  1\r\n3.0  2\r\n4.0  3\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3]}, index=[2., 3., 4.]).iloc[2:]\r\n     a\r\n4.0  3\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3]}, index=[2, 3, 4])[2:]\r\n   a\r\n4  3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly use `iloc` to positionally slide when we create a DataFrame from a pandas DataFrame with Arrow enabled.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I was trying to investigate why direct slicing refers the index value or the positional index sometimes but I stopped investigating further after reading this https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#selection\r\n\r\n> While standard Python / Numpy expressions for selecting and setting are intuitive and come in handy for interactive work, for production code, we recommend the optimized pandas data access methods, `.at`, `.iat`, `.loc` and `.iloc`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo create the correct Spark DataFrame from a pandas DataFrame without a data loss.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it is a bug fix. \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nspark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3]}, index=[2., 3., 4.])).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n|  a|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n|  a|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  3|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unittest were added.","created_at":"2020-06-25T11:15:43Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:25Z","closed_at":"2020-06-25T18:05:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3a5ce0b10b952e20e7bc04976b8bc4c52315efe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28928/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28928/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28928/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/612426e34e29229aa2187e8775ee0e453288c75d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32098","ref":"SPARK-32098","sha":"612426e34e29229aa2187e8775ee0e453288c75d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

needed?\r\n**Sequence time field steps for date start/end looks strange in spark as follows:**\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select explode(sequence(cast('2011-03-01' as date), cast('2011-03-02' as date),

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, after this patch, users will get informed `sequence step must be a day interval if start and end values are dates` when \r\nuse time field steps for date

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the check to see whether the executor is lost (by asking the `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend`) after timeout error raised in `BlockManagerMasterEndponit` due to removing blocks(e.g. RDD, broadcast, shuffle). If the executor is lost, we will ignore the error. Otherwise, throw the error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen removing blocks(e.g. RDD, broadcast, shuffle), `BlockManagerMaserEndpoint` will make RPC calls to each known `BlockManagerSlaveEndpoint` to remove the specific blocks. The PRC call sometimes could end in a timeout when the executor has been lost, but only notified the `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint` after the removing call has already happened. The timeout error could therefore fail the whole job.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we actually could just ignore the error since those blocks on the lost executor could be considered as removed already.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. In case of users hits this issue, they will have the job executed successfully instead of throwing the exception.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fix `UserDefinedType.equal()` by comparing the UDT class instead of checking `acceptsType()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's weird that equality comparison between two UDT types can have different result by switching the order:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// ExampleSubTypeUDT.userClass is a subclass of ExampleBaseTypeUDT.userClass\r\nval udt1 = new ExampleBaseTypeUDT\r\nval udt2 = new ExampleSubTypeUDT\r\nprintln(udt1 == udt2) // true\r\nprintln(udt2 == udt1) // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\n// ExampleSubTypeUDT.userClass is a subclass of ExampleBaseTypeUDT.userClass\r\nval udt1 = new ExampleBaseTypeUDT\r\nval udt2 = new ExampleSubTypeUDT\r\nprintln(udt1 == udt2) // true\r\nprintln(udt2 == udt1) // false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\n// ExampleSubTypeUDT.userClass is a subclass of ExampleBaseTypeUDT.userClass\r\nval udt1 = new ExampleBaseTypeUDT\r\nval udt2 = new ExampleSubTypeUDT\r\nprintln(udt1 == udt2) // false\r\nprintln(udt2 == udt1) // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to address the comment: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28645#discussion_r442183888\r\nIt changes `canUpCast/canCast` to allow cast from sub UDT to base UDT, in order to achieve the goal to allow UserDefinedType to use `ExpressionEncoder` to deserialize rows in ScalaUDF as well.\r\n\r\nOne thing that needs to mention is, even we allow cast from sub UDT to base UDT, it doesn't really do the cast in `Cast`. Because, yet, sub UDT and base UDT are considered as the same type(because of #16660), see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5264164a67df498b73facae207eda12ee133be7d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/UserDefinedType.scala#L81-L86\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5264164a67df498b73facae207eda12ee133be7d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/UserDefinedType.scala#L92-L95\r\n\r\nTherefore, the optimize rule `SimplifyCast` will eliminate the cast at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReduce the special case caused by `UserDefinedType` in `ResolveEncodersInUDF` and `ScalaUDF`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt should be covered by the test of `SPARK-19311`, which is also updated a little in this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-24T09:04:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T16:00:21Z","closed_at":"2020-06-24T14:51:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f20da5746beb508650b46972b15734c94e958a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/05e0f9af6819478fe0f3d185c33cf37c02963b0e","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-udf-udt","ref":"fix-udf-udt","sha":"05e0f9af6819478fe0f3d185c33cf37c02963b0e","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`formatDate` in utils.js `org/apache/spark/ui/static/utils.js` is partly refactored.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn branch-2.4ï¼task launch time is returned as html string from driver, \r\nwhile in branch-3.xï¼this is returned in JSON Object as`Date`type  from `org.apache.spark.status.api.v1.TaskData`\r\nDue toï¼\r\nLaunchTime from jersey server in spark driver is correct, which will be converted to date string like `2020-06-28T02:57:42.605GMT` in json object, then the formatDate in utils.js treat it as date.split(\".\")[0].replace(\"T\", \" \").\r\nSo `2020-06-28T02:57:42.605GMT` will be converted to `2020-06-28 02:57:42`, but correct is `2020-06-28 10:57:42` in GMT+8

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDAGSchedulerSuite exists some issue:\r\n`afterEach` and `init` are called when the `SparkConf` of the default `SparkContext` has no configuration that the test case must set. This causes the `SparkContext` initialized in `beforeEach` to be discarded without being used, resulting in waste. On the other hand, the flexibility to add configurations to `SparkConf` should be addressed by the test framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n  1. Reduce overhead about init `SparkContext`.\r\n  2. Rewrite the test framework to support apply specified spark configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to add a redirect to sql-ref.html. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore Spark 3.0 release, we are using sql-reference.md, which was replaced by sql-ref.md instead. A number of Google searches Iâve done today have turned up https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-reference.html, which does not exist any more. Thus, we should add a redirect to sql-ref.html. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-reference.html will be redirected to https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref.html\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuild it in my local environment. It works well. The sql-reference.html file was generated. The contents are like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <title>Redirecting&hellip;</title>\r\n  <link rel=\"canonical\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n#28671 introduced a change where the order in which CANCELED state for SparkExecuteStatementOperation is set was changed. Before setting the state to CANCELED, `cleanup()` was called which kills the jobs, causing an exception to be thrown inside `execute()`. This causes the state to transiently become ERROR before being set to CANCELED. This PR fixes the order.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug: wrong operation state is set.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test in SparkExecuteStatementOperationSuite.scala.","created_at":"2020-06-23T19:08:28Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T00:28:32Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T00:28:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91dab4e19ea56b38fb1fd2c611a48ec0de746929","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4aaa34bb85e9d702514978ce31bc740f325294f7","head":{"label":"alismess-db:execute-statement-operation-cleanup-order","ref":"execute-statement-operation-cleanup-order","sha":"4aaa34bb85e9d702514978ce31bc740f325294f7","user":{"login":"alismess-db","id":57817135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODE3MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57817135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db","html_url":"https://github.com/alismess-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":254159522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTQxNTk1MjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"alismess-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alismess-db","id":57817135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODE3MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57817135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db","html_url":"https://github.com/alismess-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alismess-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alismess-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to read host-local shuffle data from disk directly when external shuffle service is disabled.\r\n\r\nSimilar to #25299, we first try to get local disk directories for the shuffle data, which is located at the same host with the current executor. The only difference is, in #25299, it gets the directories from the external shuffle service while in this PR, it gets the directory from the executors.\r\n\r\nTo implement the feature, this PR extends the `HostLocalDirManager ` for both `ExternalBlockStoreClient` and `NettyBlockTransferService`. Also, this PR adds `getHostLocalDirs` for `NettyBlockTransferService` as `ExternalBlockStoreClient` does, in order to send the get-dir-request to the corresponding executor. And this PR resued the request message`GetLocalDirsForExecutors` for simple.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-27651 / #25299, Spark can read host-local shuffle data directly from disk when external shuffle service is enabled. To extend the future, we can also support it when the external shuffle service is disabled.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Before this PR, to use the host-local shuffle reading feature, users should not only enable `spark.shuffle.readHostLocalDisk` but also `spark.shuffle.service.enabled`. After this PR, enable `spark.shuffle.readHostLocalDisk` should be enough, and external shuffle service is no longer a pre-requirement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test and tested manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-23T15:04:36Z","updated_at":"2020-09-03T02:06:28Z","closed_at":"2020-09-02T20:04:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2560b1ba179c6de798ca53f33751374e721430f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28911/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28911/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28911/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a23ab1721b1225e0a95fb27660fe81847287c622","head":{"label":"Ngone51:support_node_local_shuffle","ref":"support_node_local_shuffle","sha":"a23ab1721b1225e0a95fb27660fe81847287c622","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark 3.0 accidentally dropped R < 3.5.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to ignore S4 generic methods under SparkR namespace in closure cleaning to support R 4.0.0+.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you run the codes that runs R native codes, it fails as below with R 4.0.0:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(lapply(seq(100), function (e) list(value=e)))\r\ncount(dapply(df, function(x) as.data.frame(x[x$value < 50,]), schema(df)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: R unexpectedly exited.\r\nR worker produced errors: Error in lapply(part, FUN) : attempt to bind a variable to R_UnboundValue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be related to when an S4 generic method is manually included into the closure's environment via `SparkR:::processClosure`. For example, when an RRDD is created via `createDataFrame` with calling `lapply` to convert, `lapply` itself:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f53d8c63e80172295e2fbc805c0c391bdececcaa/R/pkg/R/RDD.R#L484\r\n\r\nis added into the environment of the cleaned closure - because this is not an exposed namespace; however, this is broken in R 4.0.0+ for an unknown reason with an error message such as \"attempt to bind a variable to R_UnboundValue\".\r\n\r\nActually, we don't need to add the `lapply` into the environment of the closure because it is not supposed to be called on the worker side. In fact, there is no private generic methods supposed to be called on the worker side in SparkR at all from my understanding.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR takes a simpler path to work around just by explicitly excluding the S4 generic methods under SparkR namespace to support R 4.0.0. in SparkR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support R 4.0.0+ with SparkR, and unblock the releases on CRAN. CRAN requires the tests pass with the latest R.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will support R 4.0.0 to end-users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn many operations on CompactibleFileStreamLog reads a metadata log file and materializes all entries into memory. As the nature of the compact operation, CompactibleFileStreamLog may have a huge compact log file with bunch of entries included, and for now they're just monotonically increasing, which means the amount of memory to materialize also grows incrementally. This leads pressure on GC.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to streamline the logic on file stream source and sink whenever possible to avoid memory issue. To make this possible we have to break the existing behavior of excluding entries - now the `compactLogs` method is called with all entries, which forces us to materialize all entries into memory. This is hopefully no effect on end users, because only file stream sink has a condition to exclude entries, and the condition has been never true. (DELETE_ACTION has been never set.)\r\n\r\nBased on the observation, this patch also changes the existing UT a bit which simulates the situation where \"A\" file is added, and another batch marks the \"A\" file as deleted. This situation simply doesn't work with the change, but as I mentioned earlier it hasn't been used. (I'm not sure the UT is from the actual run. I guess not.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe memory issue (OOME) is reported by both JIRA issue and user mailing list.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Existing UTs\r\n* Manual test done\r\n\r\nThe manual test leverages the simple apps which continuously writes the file stream sink metadata log.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark-delegation-token-experiment/commit/bea7680e4c588f455f8c3181a96c9eff5002fa1a\r\n\r\nThe test is configured to have a batch metadata log file at 1.9M (10,000 entries) whereas other Spark configuration is set to the default. (compact interval = 10) The app runs as driver, and the heap memory on driver is set to 3g.\r\n\r\n> before the patch\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1094\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-23 at 3 37 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/85375841-d94f3480-b571-11ea-817b-c6b48b34888a.png\">\r\n\r\nIt only ran for 40 mins, with the latest compact batch file size as 1.3G.

The actual memory usage didn't even go up to 1.2G, and be cleaned up soon without outstanding GC activity.","created_at":"2020-06-23T08:11:52Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T06:08:49Z","closed_at":"2020-08-20T09:31:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c80ffbfd5361588347df23bc47ed258933331e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMany databases and data warehouse SQL engines support temporary tables. A temporary table, as its named implied, is a short-lived table that its life will be only for current session.\r\n[Hive Temporary Table](https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.0.1/using-hiveql/content/hive_create_a_hive_temporary_table.html)\r\n[Teradata Volatile Table](https://docs.teradata.com/reader/rgAb27O_xRmMVc_aQq2VGw/mpJF1z_vSlpMbZYxFmRJfA)\r\n[PostgreSQL Temporary Table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createtable.html)\r\n\r\nIn Spark, there is no temporary table. the DDL âCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE AS SELECTâ will create a temporary view. A temporary view is totally different with a temporary table. \r\n\r\nThis ticket to support Spark native temporary table. More details are described in [DESIGN DOCS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RS4Q3VbxlZ_Yy0fdWgTJ-k0QxFd1dToCqpLAYvIJ34U/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nParent ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32063\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA temporary view is just a VIEW. It doesnât materialize data in storage. So it has below shortage:\r\n\r\n1. View will not give improved performance. Materialize intermediate data in temporary tables for a complex query will accurate queries, especially in an ETL pipeline.\r\n2. View which calls other views can cause severe performance issues. Even, executing a very complex view may fail in Spark. \r\n3. Temporary view has no database namespace. In some complex ETL pipelines or data warehouse applications, without database prefix is not convenient. It needs some tables which only used in current session.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYES.\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tt1 AS SELECT ..\r\n```\r\nbefore the patch, it will create a local temporary VIEW. After this patch, it will create a temporary table.\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tt1 USING ..\r\n```\r\nbefore the patch, it will throw exception. After this patch, it will create a temporary table.\r\n\r\nAdd a new API in `Catalog.scala`\r\n```scala\r\ndef dropTempTable(tableName: String): Boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-23T03:55:11Z","updated_at":"2020-11-02T00:34:58Z","closed_at":"2020-11-02T00:34:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e6403a0e246c306b7bcc4d2f546be844d7bddc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b11aace28be8169e8eff1ce61810bc8250fc37d","head":{"label":"LantaoJin:SPARK-32064","ref":"SPARK-32064","sha":"9b11aace28be8169e8eff1ce61810bc8250fc37d","user":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90969496,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDk2OTQ5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"LantaoJin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to coalesce partitions for repartition by expressions without specifying number of partitions, when AQE is enabled. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen repartition by some partition expressions, users can specify number of partitions or not. If  the number of partitions is specified, we should not coalesce partitions because it breaks user expectation. But if without specifying number of partitions, AQE should be able to coalesce partitions as other shuffling.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. After this change, if users don't specify the number of partitions when repartitioning data by expressions, AQE will coalesce partitions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.","created_at":"2020-06-23T02:54:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:49Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T11:33:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2ad187072636516f6f0e685325780dd42b2bdc76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ae1a8799ecf0a485cb4617a54d8d68feea0eaf8","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-32056","ref":"SPARK-32056","sha":"1ae1a8799ecf0a485cb4617a54d8d68feea0eaf8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is intended to solve schema pruning not working with window functions, as described in SPARK-32059. It also solved schema pruning not working with `Sort`. It also generalizes with `Project->Filter->[any node can be pruned]`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is needed because of performance issues with nested structures with querying using window functions as well as sorting. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIntroduced two tests: 1) optimizer planning level 2) end-to-end tests with SQL queries.

When we have different numeric types in the column it will be resolved correctly. And when we have other different types it will be resolved as a String type column\r\n> IntegerType\r\n> > LongType\r\n> > > DecimalType\r\n> > > > DoubleType\r\n> > > > > StringType\r\n\r\n> TimestampType\r\n> > StringType\r\n\r\n> BooleanType\r\n> > StringType\r\n\r\n> StringType\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Fixes an issue with separate consecutive `ReuseExchange` and `ReuseSubquery` rules that can result a `ReusedExchange` node pointing to an invalid exchange. This can happen due to the 2 separate rules when `ReuseSubquery` rule modifies an exchange that has already been referenced (reused) in `ReuseExchange` rule.\r\n   Consider the following query:\r\n   ```\r\n   WITH t AS (\r\n     SELECT df1.id, df2.k\r\n     FROM df1 JOIN df2 ON df1.k = df2.k\r\n     WHERE df2.id < 2\r\n   ),\r\n   t2 AS (\r\n     SELECT * FROM t\r\n     UNION\r\n     SELECT * FROM t\r\n   )\r\n   SELECT * FROM t2 AS a JOIN t2 AS b ON a.id = b.id\r\n   ```\r\n   Before this PR the plan of the query was (note the `<== this reuse node points to a non-existing node`

contains issue 1 as well.)\r\n\r\n3. Improves the reuse of exchanges and subqueries by enabling reuse across the whole plan. This means that the new combined rule utilizes the reuse opportunities between parent and subqueries by traversing the whole plan. The traversal is started on the top level query only.\r\n\r\n4. Due to the order of traversal this PR does while adding reuse nodes, the reuse nodes appear in parent queries if reuse is possible between different levels of queries (typical for DPP). This is not an issue from execution perspective, but this also means \"forward references\" in explain formatted output where parent queries come first. The changes I made to `ExplainUtils` are to handle these references properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above 3 issues by unifying the separate rules into a `ReuseExchangeAndSubquery` rule that does a 1 pass, whole-plan, bottom-up traversal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- New UTs in `ReuseExchangeAndSubquerySuite` to cover 1. and 2.\r\n- New UTs in `DynamicPartitionPruningSuite`, `SubquerySuite` and `ExchangeSuite` to cover 3.\r\n- New `ReuseMapSuite` to test `ReuseMap`.\r\n- Checked new golden files of `PlanStabilitySuite`s for invalid reuse references.\r\n- TPCDS benchmarks.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-21T08:00:12Z","updated_at":"2021-06-22T11:13:21Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T04:53:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5945624a396617da703dd75d9094633c6fb65afd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7187ebd2e053570d92017100dba4a0738fa2f014","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-29375-SPARK-28940-whole-plan-reuse","ref":"SPARK-29375-SPARK-28940-whole-plan-reuse","sha":"7187ebd2e053570d92017100dba4a0738fa2f014","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1.Add a UT in `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalogSuite`\r\n2.Throw `AnalysisException` when table storage location url not equal to storage path properties.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n**Step 1**,When hive support is enabled and we use sparksql create and save hive table as fellowï¼ \r\n`df = spark.createDataFrame([{\"a\": \"x\", \"b\": \"y\", \"c\": \"3\"}])`\r\n`df.write.format(\"orc\").option(\"compression\", \"ZLIB\").mode(\"overwrite\").saveAsTable('test_spark');`\r\n**Step 2**,When we alter table name through hive interface not spark like belowï¼\r\n  `alter table test_spark rename to test_spark2;`\r\nThe location of `test_spark` is changed to `test_spark2` but spark maintain the path serde `test_spark`ï¼this lead to spark read `test_spark` while `test_spark2` is expected\r\n**Step 3**, Since we can not forbidden alter table from hive side, once this happens, we need to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCreate a single post-order rule for ReuseExchange and ReuseSubquery which traverses the plan in 1 single post order and replaces duplicated nodes with ReusedExchangeExec, ReuseSubqueryExec.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the `ReusedExchangeExec Reference issue` where a ReusedExchangeExec points to an Exchange which doesn't exist in entire query plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark do 3 iterations on plan to identify and replace nodes which can be ReusedExchangeExec and ReusedSubqueryExec:\r\nPhase-1: First one is done in ReuseExchange rule to replace Exchange with ReusedExchangeExec. \r\nPhase-2: Seconds one is introduces by DPP in ReuseExchange rule to find out all the InSubqueryExec and traverse the plans inside it and replace relevant Exchange with ReusedSubqueryExec. \r\nPhase-3: Third we do in ReuseSubquery rule to identify ExecSubqueryExpression which are reusable and replace them with ReuseSubqueryExec.\r\n\r\nWhen any change is done by Phase-2/Phase-3 in a subtree of Exchange, then the id of exchange will change. and sometimes this leads to another ReusedExchangeExec pointing to Exchange which doesn't exist in plan.\r\n\r\nExample: Suppose this is the plan after Phase-1 when we try to do self join of a view.\r\n\r\n                                     SORTMERGEJOIN         \r\n           Exchange (id=1234)                          ReusedExchangeExec (points-to-id=1234)\r\n                          |\r\n                     ChildSubtree\r\n\r\nSuppose ChildSubtree has DPP applied inside it. So Phase-2 will try to convert plan inside InSubqueryExec to use ReuseBroadcast and in that process, complete hierarchy of ChildSubtree will also change. i.e.\r\n\r\n                                     SORTMERGEJOIN         \r\n           Exchange (id=1878)                        ReusedExchangeExec (points-to-id=1234)\r\n                          |\r\n                    NewChildSubtree\r\n\r\nBut the `ReusedExchangeExec (points-to-id=1234)` is still pointing to id 1234 and so no reuse will happen.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by merging Phase1,Phase2 and Phase3 into a single post order traversal.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\nAlso tried the fix on TPCDS 1000 scale with Spark 2.4.5 + DPP

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a Spark Job launched in Cluster mode with Yarn, Application Master sets spark.ui.port port to 0 which means Driver's web UI gets any random port even if we want to explicitly set the Port range for Driver's Web UI\r\n\r\n## Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe access Spark Web UI via Knox Proxy, and there are firewall restrictions due to which we can not access Spark Web UI since Web UI port range gets random port even if we set explicitly.\r\n\r\nThis Change will check if there is a specified port range explicitly mentioned so that it does not assign a random port.\r\n\r\n## Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nLocal

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nWhen a Spark Job launched in Cluster mode with Yarn, Application Master sets `spark.ui.port` port to 0 which means Driver's web UI gets any random port even if we want to explicitly set the Port range for Driver's Web UI\r\n\r\n**Why are the changes needed?**\r\nWe access Spark Web UI via Knox Proxy, and there are firewall restrictions due to which we can not access Spark Web UI since Web UI port range gets random port even if we set explicitly. \r\n\r\nThis Change will check if there is a specified port range explicitly mentioned so that it does not assign a random port. \r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nLocal

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch applies `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` to distinct aggregate to fix a regression of distinct aggregate on NaNs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe added `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` optimization rule in 3.0.0 to normalize special floating numbers (NaN and -0.0). But it is missing in distinct aggregate so causes a regression. We need to apply this rule on distinct aggregate to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing a regression of distinct aggregate on NaNs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR add unlimited MATCHED and NOT MATCHED clauses in MERGE INTO statement.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow the MERGE INTO syntax is,\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO [db_name.]target_table [AS target_alias]\r\n USING [db_name.]source_table [<time_travel_version>] [AS source_alias]\r\n ON <merge_condition>\r\n [ WHEN MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <matched_action> ]\r\n [ WHEN MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <matched_action> ]\r\n [ WHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <not_matched_action> ]\r\n```\r\nIt would be nice if we support unlimited MATCHED and NOT MATCHED clauses in MERGE INTO statement, because users may want to deal with different \"AND <condition>\"s, the result of which just like a series of \"CASE WHEN\"s. The expected syntax looks like\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO [db_name.]target_table [AS target_alias]\r\n USING [db_name.]source_table [<time_travel_version>] [AS source_alias]\r\n ON <merge_condition>\r\n [when_matched_clause [, ...]]\r\n [when_not_matched_clause [, ...]]\r\n```\r\nwhere when_matched_clause is\r\n```\r\nWHEN MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <matched_action>\r\n```\r\nand when_not_matched_clause is\r\n```\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND <condition> ] THEN <not_matched_action>\r\n ```\r\nmatched_action can be one of\r\n```\r\nDELETE\r\nUPDATE SET * or\r\nUPDATE SET col1 = value1 [, col2 = value2, ...]\r\n```\r\nand not_matched_action can be one of\r\n```\r\nINSERT *\r\nINSERT (col1 [, col2, ...]) VALUES (value1 [, value2, ...])\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR will remove references to these \"blacklist\" and \"whitelist\" terms besides the blacklisting feature as a whole, which can be handled in a separate JIRA/PR.\r\n\r\nThis touches quite a few files, but the changes are straightforward (variable/method/etc. name changes) and most quite self-contained.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs per discussion on the Spark dev list, it will be beneficial to remove references to problematic language that can alienate potential community members. One such reference is \"blacklist\" and \"whitelist\". While it seems to me that there is some valid debate as to whether these terms have racist origins, the cultural connotations are inescapable in today's world. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIn the test file `HiveQueryFileTest`, a developer has the ability to specify the system property `spark.hive.whitelist` to specify a list of Hive query files that should be tested. This system property has been renamed to `spark.hive.includelist`. The old property has been kept for compatibility, but will log a warning if used. I am open to feedback from others on whether keeping a deprecated property here is unnecessary given that this is just for developers running tests.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark uses an old and deprecated API named `KafkaConsumer.poll(long)` which never returns and stays in live lock if metadata is not updated (for instance when broker disappears at consumer creation). Please see [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/25/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#poll-long-) and [standalone test application](https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/kafka-get-assignment) for further details.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've applied the new `KafkaConsumer.poll(Duration)` API on executor side. Please note driver side still uses the old API which will be fixed in SPARK-32032.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nInfinite wait in `KafkaConsumer.poll(long)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-19T09:19:59Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T08:33:06Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T21:46:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c983fa33980c3062504e7d283d2565e7ba886d03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith my understanding of Aggregate framework, especially, according to the logic of `AggUtils.planAggXXX`, I think for the `PartialMerge`/`Final` `AggregateExpression` the right references should be `inputAggBufferAttributes`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, for an Aggregate operator, its input attributes will always be equal to or more than(because it refers to its own attributes while it should refer to the attributes from the child) its reference attributes. Therefore, its missing inputs must always be empty and break nothing. Thus, it's impossible to add a UT for this patch.\r\n\r\nHowever, after correcting the right references in this PR, the problem is then exposed by `QueryTest.assertEmptyMissingInput` in the UT of SPARK-31620, since missing inputs are no longer always empty. This PR can fix the problem.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-19T07:21:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T14:13:43Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T14:00:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7da460f76879b6478b5fc5828c0aa5c317640479","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/04a2d4485021b8be1aa66936e2ca071bd52990a6","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-agg-reference","ref":"fix-agg-reference","sha":"04a2d4485021b8be1aa66936e2ca071bd52990a6","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**First**\r\n`DAGSchedulerSuite` provides `completeNextStageWithFetchFailure` to make all tasks in non first stage occur `FetchFailed`.\r\nBut many test case uses complete directly as follows:\r\n```scala\r\n complete(taskSets(1), Seq(\r\n     (FetchFailed(makeBlockManagerId(\"hostA\"),\r\n        shuffleDep1.shuffleId, 0L, 0, 0, \"ignored\"), null)))\r\n```\r\nWe need to reuse `completeNextStageWithFetchFailure`.\r\n\r\n**Second**\r\n`DAGSchedulerSuite` also check the results show below:\r\n```scala\r\ncomplete(taskSets(0), Seq((Success, 42)))\r\nassert(results === Map(0 -> 42))\r\n```\r\nWe can extract it as a generic method of `checkAnswer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReuse

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change replaces the world slave with alternatives matching the context.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is no need to call things slave, we might as well use better clearer names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the ouput JSON does change. To allow backwards compatibility this is an additive change.\r\nThe shell scripts for starting & stopping workers are renamed, and for backwards compatibility old scripts are added to call through to the new ones while printing a deprecation message to stderr.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2020-06-18T18:04:13Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T23:06:57Z","closed_at":"2020-07-13T21:06:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f0b9be200414471f0de9d29e2905e9af4e2adb7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c43172daf2b9ad38fce32f5349c87944fa62caa","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-32004-drop-references-to-slave","ref":"SPARK-32004-drop-references-to-slave","sha":"9c43172daf2b9ad38fce32f5349c87944fa62caa","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen loading DataFrames from JDBC datasource with Kerberos authentication, remote executors (yarn-client/cluster etc. modes) fail to establish a connection due to lack of Kerberos ticket or ability to generate it.\r\n\r\nThis is a real issue when trying to ingest data from kerberized data sources (SQL Server, Oracle) in enterprise environment where exposing simple authentication access is not an option due to IT policy issues.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added Oracle support.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Added `OracleConnectionProvider`\r\n* Added `OracleConnectionProviderSuite`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing JDBC kerberos support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, now user is able to connect to Oracle using kerberos.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Additional + existing unit tests\r\n* Test on cluster manually. There is no automated integration test, just like MS SQL. The reason is the same. Namely I've tried to make it work with `MiniKDC` but it was working only with Active Directory (AD is not available in docker, please see https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/165).","created_at":"2020-06-18T15:43:10Z","updated_at":"2020-06-30T20:56:37Z","closed_at":"2020-06-30T17:30:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b45ca0c3a2fc29dbc0af4387f3b73953c19b4042","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/461eed070d86a7d9d5f8ba536a69d59621faa907","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-31336","ref":"SPARK-31336","sha":"461eed070d86a7d9d5f8ba536a69d59621faa907","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is for fixing bug [32024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32024). We found after history server restart, below error would randomly happen: \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Disk usage tracker went negative (now = -***, delta = -***)\" from `HistoryServerDiskManager`. \r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10524738/85034468-fda4ae80-b136-11ea-9011-f0c3e6508002.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Cause**: Reading data from level db would trigger table file compaction, which may also trigger size of level db directory changes.  This size change may not be recorded in LevelDB (`ApplicationStoreInfo` in `listing`). When service restarts, `currentUsage` is calculated from real directory size, but `ApplicationStoreInfo` are loaded from leveldb, then `currentUsage` may be less then sum of `ApplicationStoreInfo.size`. In `makeRoom()` function, `ApplicationStoreInfo.size` is used to update usage. Then `currentUsage` becomes negative after several round of `release()` and `lease()` (`makeRoom()`).\r\n**Reproduce**: we can reproduce this issue in dev environment by reducing config value of \"spark.history.retainedApplications\" and \"spark.history.store.maxDiskUsage\" to some small values. Here are steps: 1. start history server, load some applications and access some pages (maybe \"stages\" page to trigger leveldb compaction). 2. restart HS, and refresh pages.\r\nI also added an UT to simulate this case in `HistoryServerDiskManagerSuite`.\r\n**Benefit**: this change would help improve history server reliability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNew `spark.sql.metadataCacheTTLSeconds` option that adds time-to-live cache behaviour to the existing caches in `FileStatusCache` and `SessionCatalog`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark [caches file listing for tables](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.4/sql-data-sources-parquet.html#metadata-refreshing) and requires issuing `REFRESH TABLE` any time the file listing has changed outside of Spark. Unfortunately, simply submitting `REFRESH TABLE` commands could be very cumbersome. Assuming frequently added files, hundreds of tables and dozens of users querying the data (and expecting up-to-date results), manually refreshing metadata for each table is not a solution. \r\n\r\nThis is a pretty common use-case for streaming ingestion of data, which can be done outside of Spark (with tools like Kafka Connect, etc.).\r\n\r\nA similar feature exists in Presto: `hive.file-status-cache-expire-time` can be found [here](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html#hive-configuration-properties).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it's controlled with the new `spark.sql.metadataCacheTTLSeconds` option.\r\n\r\nWhen it's set to `-1` (by default), the behaviour of caches doesn't change, so it stays _backwards-compatible_.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you can specify a value in seconds, for example `spark.sql.metadataCacheTTLSeconds: 60` means 1-minute cache TTL.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests in:\r\n\r\n- FileIndexSuite\r\n- SessionCatalogSuite\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-17T21:18:47Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T18:32:23Z","closed_at":"2020-07-17T13:41:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd1d7377c8ffe1b4cd0460a6c9454afa79e5b7de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e761dcd790b9c30e5cee7bffe916dfc2c82b7a5","head":{"label":"sap1ens:SPARK-30616-metadata-cache-ttl","ref":"SPARK-30616-metadata-cache-ttl","sha":"3e761dcd790b9c30e5cee7bffe916dfc2c82b7a5","user":{"login":"sap1ens","id":260702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens","html_url":"https://github.com/sap1ens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273033464,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzMwMzM0NjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"sap1ens/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sap1ens","id":260702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens","html_url":"https://github.com/sap1ens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sap1ens/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the test to get an active executorId and set it as preferred location instead of setting a fixed preferred location.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test is flaky. After checking the [log](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/124086/artifact/core/), I find the root cause is:\r\n\r\nTwo test cases from different test suites got submitted at the same time because of concurrent execution. In this particular case, the two test cases (from DistributedSuite and BarrierTaskContextSuite) both launch under local-cluster mode. The two applications are submitted at the SAME time so they have the same applications(app-20200615210132-0000). Thus, when the cluster of BarrierTaskContextSuite is launching executors, it failed to create the directory for the executor 0, because the path (/home/jenkins/workspace/work/app-app-20200615210132-0000/0) has been used by the cluster of DistributedSuite. Therefore, it has to launch executor 1 and 2 instead, that lead to non of the tasks can get preferred locality thus they got scheduled together and lead to the test failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove reference from `java.lang.ApplicationShutdownHooks` to `sparkContext` when the spark context is stopped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  /** The active SparkSession for the current thread. */\r\n  private val activeThreadSession = new InheritableThreadLocal[SparkSession]\r\n\r\n  protected[spark] val localProperties = new InheritableThreadLocal[Properties]\r\n```\r\nThere is still a reference(eg. `java.lang.ApplicationShutdownHooks` -> `org.apache.hive.common.util.ShutdownHookManager$1` -> `SparkContext`) to `sparkContext` after the spark context is stopped because `activeThreadSession` and `localProperties` variables are `InheritableThreadLocal` object , so the JVM cannot collect that. \r\n\r\nIf we start and stop sparkSession several times, there will be a OOM exception.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3626747/84971997-867c1400-b150-11ea-8128-81299e6277b1.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the test to get an active executorId and set it as preferred location instead of setting a fixed preferred location.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test is flaky. After checking the [log](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/124086/artifact/core/), I find the root cause is:\r\n\r\nTwo test cases from different test suites got submitted at the same time because of concurrent execution. In this particular case, the two test cases (from DistributedSuite and BarrierTaskContextSuite) both launch under local-cluster mode. The two applications are submitted at the SAME time so they have the same applications(app-20200615210132-0000). Thus, when the cluster of BarrierTaskContextSuite is launching executors, it failed to create the directory for the executor 0, because the path (/home/jenkins/workspace/work/app-app-20200615210132-0000/0) has been used by the cluster of DistributedSuite. Therefore, it has to launch executor 1 and 2 instead, that lead to non of the tasks can get preferred locality thus they got scheduled together and lead to the test failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test can not be reproduced locally. We can only know it's been fixed when it's no longer flaky on

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf an executor is lost, the `DAGScheduler` handles the executor loss by removing the executor but does not unregister its outputs if the external shuffle service is used. However, if the node on which the executor runs is lost, the shuffle service may not be able to serve the shuffle files.\r\nIn such a case, when fetches from the executor's outputs fail in the same stage, the `DAGScheduler` again removes the executor and by right, should unregister its outputs. It doesn't because the epoch used to track the executor failure has not increased.\r\n\r\nWe track the epoch for failed executors that result in lost file output separately, so we can unregister the outputs in this scenario. The idea to track a second epoch is due to Attila Zsolt Piros.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout the changes, the loss of a node could require two stage attempts to recover instead of one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test. This test fails without the change and passes with it.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-17T04:54:28Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T14:57:21Z","closed_at":"2020-07-22T14:53:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4bcc071b3987296cfe0ceb2e3ab318c3edd57ff6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e0086288f6279569e8a11cef9d928b87c40469b","head":{"label":"wypoon:SPARK-32003","ref":"SPARK-32003","sha":"0e0086288f6279569e8a11cef9d928b87c40469b","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108919243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg5MTkyNDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wypoon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon/spark","description":"Mirror

Instead of creating query stages in batch, incrementally creating query stage can bring the optimization in earlier. It could avoid unnecessary local shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current way of creating query stage in AQE is in batch. For example, the children of a sort merge join will be materialized as query stages in a batch. Then AQE brings the optimization in and optimize sort merge join to broadcast join. Except for the broadcasted exchange, we don't need do any exchange on another side of join but we already materialized the exchange. Currently AQE wraps the materialized exchange with local reader, but it still brings unnecessary I/O. We can avoid unnecessary local shuffle by incrementally creating query stage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the warning about multi-thread in local properties, and change the guide to use `collectWithJobGroup` for multi-threads for now because:\r\n- It is too noisy to users who don't use multiple threads - the number of this single thread case is arguably more prevailing.\r\n- There was a critical issue found about pin-thread mode SPARK-32010, which will be fixed in Spark 3.1.\r\n- To smoothly migrate, `RDD.collectWithJobGroup` was added, which will be deprecated in Spark 3.1 with SPARK-32010 fixed.\r\n\r\nI will target to deprecate `RDD.collectWithJobGroup`, and make this pin-thread mode stable in Spark 3.1. In the future releases, I plan to make this mode as a default mode, and remove `RDD.collectWithJobGroup` away.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid guiding users a feature with a critical issue, and provide a proper workaround for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, warning message and documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n/.../spark/python/pyspark/util.py:141: UserWarning: Currently, 'setLocalProperty' (set to local \r\nproperties) with multiple threads does not properly work.\r\nInternally threads on PVM and JVM are not synced, and JVM thread can be reused for multiple \r\nthreads on PVM, which fails to isolate local properties for each thread on PVM.\r\nTo work around this, you can set PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD to true (see SPARK-22340). However, \r\nnote that it cannot inherit the local properties from the parent thread although it isolates each \r\nthread on PVM and JVM with its own local properties.\r\nTo work around this, you
