SUMMARY\r\nChanges the log level from `exception` to `warning` for failed attempts to load table/view schemas from analytics DBs. These failures are typically due to misconfiguration of the database credentials, or transient failures in connecting to or querying the DB, and therefore should not log as an exception.\r\n\r\nAn example error that will be converted from `exception` level logging to `warning`:\r\n```\r\n(psycopg2.OperationalError) could not translate host name \"scratchdb-aws-c1.us-west2-aws.production.test.zone\" to address: Name or service not known\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerify log level of `warning` for failures to fetch table/view schemas from analytics DBs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the new export functionality (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167) to the frontend, behind the feature flag `VERSIONED_EXPORT`. When the flag is enabled (disabled by default):\r\n\r\n- The dataset export will return the new format (ZIP with multiple YAML files).\r\n- The dashboard export will return the new format.\r\n- An option to export charts and databases is added, returning the new format.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### Dashboard\r\n\r\nNo

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nReact-bootstrap adds styles with a VERY broad `:focus` style, adding goofy outlines all over the place. \r\n\r\nI'm removing that outline for a few key elements, namely `div` `span` and `i` so we don't see them in strange places. This should not affect focus on form elements and such, so it has a relatively low impact on accessibility. That said, I admit there may be areas where there's tab-based navigation we DO want to support. In such cases, we should make sure that it's supported (and styled) _properly_ in those relevant components, when we get to do a broader accessibility sweep to meet WCAG standards.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug where when `DASHBOARD_CACHE` feature flag is enabled, saving datasource will become too slow and sometimes generate the following error: \r\n\r\n> (raised as a result of Query-invoked autoflush; consider using a session.no_autoflush block if this flush is occurring prematurely) (pymysql.err.OperationalError) (1205, 'Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction') [SQL: UPDATE table_columns SET changed_on=%(changed_on)s, is_active=%(is_active)s, changed_by_fk=%(changed_by_fk)s WHERE table_columns.id = %(table_columns_id)s] [parameters: {'changed_on': datetime.datetime(2020, 10, 20, 17, 15, 11, 547150), 'is_active': None, 'changed_by_fk': 9117, 'table_columns_id': 1555231}] (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/13/e3q8)\r\n\r\nThis is because of a wrong join condition where I thought multiple join conditions can be passed to SQLAlchemy's [join](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/selectable.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.join) as consecutive positional arguments, when it's actually expecting only one positional argument for the join conditions.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a typo that has made editing datasource unable to update the dashboard cache.\r\n\r\ncc @graceguo-supercat @serenajiang \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n- Enable `DASHBOARD_CACHE`\r\n- Try edit a datasource in the Explore view\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

SUMMARY\r\nAfter we deployed #11236, several charts broke because the sql parser could not identify the type of the query and pessimistically classified them as write queries. These problems occur because the sql parser is sensitive to certain syntax issues that may not actually be problems in some dialects of sql (in this case, presto sql).\r\n\r\nThese errors are confusing to users because their queries work in sql lab but fail in explore view. Debugging and fixing the so-called \"incorrect\" syntax is very tedious.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I am allowing queries with an \"UNKNOWN\" type (optimistic instead of pessimistic). This couuuuld potentially allow some write queries through, but it's still a step up from how things were before #11236.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nSome examples of correct queries that failed in explore view due to unknown type:\r\n```sql\r\nWITH x AS(SELECT 1 AS col) SELECT * FROM x\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH events AS (SELECT 1 AS col) SELECT * FROM events\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nRolling back the change I made that forced all `<Label/>` to be `uppercase`. In many cases, labels contain table names, viz type names, filter summary and other things where case matters. We should leave as is by default.\r\n\r\nThe original intent was to have good vertical alignment of letters inside the label, and having all letters have the same height make things look more even, but I think that doesn't matter much.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### after\r\n<img width=\"504\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-20 at 10 55 44 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI added babel plugin for production debug babel variant - it trims data-test from production code. It requires passing BABEL_ENV=production while building prod.\r\nI observed that it is not applicable for inputProps:\r\n```     <div style={{ margin: '5px 0' }}>\r\n                        <Datetime\r\n                          inputProps={{ 'data-test': 'date-from-input' }}\r\n```\r\nand for code in templates in superset/ directory:\r\n```  \r\n<!-- Modal for misc messages / alerts  -->\r\n    <div class=\"misc-modal modal fade\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"myModalLabel\">\r\n      <div class=\"modal-dialog\" role=\"document\">\r\n        <div class=\"modal-content\" data-test=\"modal-content\">\r\n          <div class=\"modal-header\" data-test=\"modal-header\">\r\n            <button type=\"button\" class=\"close\" data-dismiss=\"modal\" aria-label=\"Close\" data-test=\"modal-header-close-button\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is working for \r\n```    const trs = [\r\n      <tr {...{ 'data-test': 'table-row' }} className=\"row\" key={record.id}>\r\n        {tds}\r\n      </tr>,\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I think the next step is to wrap somehow elements from superset/ and replace inputProps with some other wrapper for elements.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the chart data endpoint always shows data as being cached. This differs from how the legacy endpoint works, which for the first or forced load doesn't show the `cached` pill. This changes the behaviour on the new endpoint to work similar to how the old one works.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour (legacy endpoint)\r\nIn this video we can see how the `CACHED` pill is deactivated when the data is force refreshed:\r\n![line-current](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/96441025-7d3fa880-1211-11eb-97d7-db9661b260bc.gif)\r\n\r\n### Current behaviour (v1 chart data endpoint)\r\nHere we see the new data endpoint before the change. Note how the `CACHED` pill is always active:\r\n![echarts-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/96441115-a102ee80-1211-11eb-82e4-84289fce3dc9.gif)\r\n\r\n### New behaviour (v1 chart data endpoint)\r\nHere we see the new data endpoint after the

SUMMARY\r\nAdds support for `applied_filters` and `rejected_filters` to chart data endpoint + adds support for temporal extras to both `viz.py` and chart data endpoint.\r\n\r\nShort summary of changes:\r\n- In the legacy data `json_explore` endpoint, temporal extras (`__time_range` etc) are applied to `form_data` in `merge_extras` (see: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/735123d1f5513d366955db1865faf6b064c9bd4a/superset/utils/core.py#L922-L953 ), information of which temporal filters have been overridden is lost. To get around this, we add the applied temporal extras in a dict called `applied_time_extras` that we can later reference to determine which of them were applied and which were not.\r\n- since `superset-ui/core` merges temporal extras to the query object prior to sending the request, essentially performing the above operation (see: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/packages/superset-ui-core/src/query/extractExtras.ts) , we need to pass along `applied_time_extras` in the request.\r\n\r\n**Please note**: needs to upgrade to new version of `superset-ui/core` introduced here to function properly with v1 API plugins: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/809 .\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\nIn the below screenshot we can see that all temporal SQL filters are showing up as applied, while the druid ones aren't, as they aren't applicable to SQL datasources:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/96431847-c2ada700-120c-11eb-8a0c-39c8a89267d7.png)\r\n\r\nIn the below screenshot we can see that all filters are flagged as incompatible, as the datasource doesn't have the gender column, nor any temporal SQL or Druid columns:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/96415516-61c7a400-11f7-11eb-8caf-b3d2a11580da.png)\r\n\r\nIn this screenshot, we have both legacy (top row) and v1 (bottom row) viz plugins on the same dashboard. Notice that the filters apply similar to the legacy plugins:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/96431717-95f98f80-120c-11eb-9e48-4504a2874028.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPer the SQLAlchemy  default dialect it seems that the [`do_ping`](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/engine/default.py#L625-L639) method will raise only if the ping failed via a non-disconnect. This PR ensures that if the ping fails (either via raising an error or returning `False`) that the test connection also fails.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it seems that the `do_ping` could raise a number of DBAPI exceptions and thus I thought there was merit in catching a broader exception.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is to fix an issue related to #11220 . To reproduce:\r\n1. open a dashboard and edit,\r\n2. save change, successfully,\r\n3. in the same browser window, edit same dashboard again,\r\n4. when you try to save the 2nd change, you will see error message.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is, after user's first update, the client-side still hold the previous value for dashboard last_updated_time. On user submit the second edit, server-side compare the last_updated_time with newer one and will reject the 2nd edit request.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds solution for this issue: update last_updated_time in client-side when the first save is successful.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and new unit test.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug where dashboard cache used while visiting dashboard via slug is not updated when editing an embedded chart.\r\n\r\nI used `dashboard.slug` in the default dashboard `__repr__` string because I wanted to make it human readable, but since this is mostly used in cache and not all dashboards have slugs, human readability doesn't really matter. It's more important to have stable cache keys.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Enable `DASHBOARD_CACHE` feature flag\r\n2. Visit a dashboard with slug\r\n3. Edit a chart in the dashboard\r\n4. In base you will not see the chart updates when you return to dashboard and refresh. After the fix, the chart in dashboard should be updated.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nChange the save button text to \"Save as new chart\" when users cannot override an existing chart (normally because they are not the owner of the chart).\r\n\r\nWanted to add this change because I tried to edit a chart from someone else's dashboard today, after saving it I didn't see the change in the dashboard and got confused.\r\n\r\nThe text will only change if you are editing from an existing chart.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nOpen an existing chart that you are not an owner of, try save the chart:\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug from #11234 where cache keys for dashboard bootstrap data are incorrectly deleted.\r\n\r\nWe noticed this when some dashboard failed to update cache when updating charts. \r\n\r\n`delete_memoized` from Flask caching treats instance method and class method differently:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Delete memoized is also smart about instance methods vs class methods.\r\n        When passing a instancemethod, it will only clear the cache related\r\n        to that instance of that object. (object uniqueness can be overridden\r\n        by defining the __repr__ method, such as user id).\r\n        When passing a classmethod, it will clear all caches related across\r\n        all instances of that class.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Create a dashboard and add a chart\r\n2. Change chart title in Dashboard edit mode\r\n3. Explore the chart, make updates and save\r\n4. Return to dashboard and refresh. In base, you may see the chart is not updated. After the fix, the chart should update.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nUpdate webpack config so that developers can `npm link .../plugin-path` without also having to `npm link ../path/to/superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-core/`.  Currently you have to do the additional linking because `npm link` will install its own version of `@superset-ui/core` under the plugin's `node_modules`, which will take precedent for the plugin's JS modules during module resolution.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. clone the [superset-ui](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/) repo\r\n2. npm link a plugin `npm link ~/projects/superset-ui/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/` in `superset-frontend`\r\n3. Your plugin should show up in viz type selection\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

dev script in docker. Change was applied in tsx file in container but UI did not show this change applied without restarting. I added an option to possibly run npm run dev-server while using docker-compose up setup.```\r\n**UPDATE**:\r\nI tested hot-reload mechanism again and I was able to use hot-reload without any historical change from this pull request. I returned original logic in files and introduced only one minor change - > instead of npm run dev command triggered from docker-compose I placed this to docker-frontend.sh file -> for being consistent with backend and other services in yaml. @craig-rueda let me know if this change is nice to have or do we want to close this PR as not needed now.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nLarge and complex dashboards can be very slow to load because they need to read all the related slices and datasources and they all have go through SQL queries with no caching enabled.\r\n\r\nA previous [attempt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/10963) to cache the rendered dashboard page had to be reverted because it did not consider user-specific data on that page. Why don't we cache the non-user-specific bootstrap data instead?\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts the data building logics from the `/dashboard/:id_or_slug` Flask view to the `Dashboard` model and uses Flack caching decorator to manage the cache. Cache will be cleaned up when any one of the dashboard, the associated slices, datasources, or table columns/metrics is updated.\r\n\r\nWhen tested with a dashboard of 300+ slices in our staging environment, this change can save up to more than 3 seconds of page load time.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nMake sure the dashboard page still work as expected.\r\n\r\n- You second visit to a very large dashboard page should be much more faster\r\n- Update a slice or datasource, refresh the Dashboard page, you should see the updates\r\n- User access etc should still work\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new endpoint at `/api/v1/databases/export/?q=!(id1,id2)` for exporting databases (with datasets) as a zipped file, according to https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167.\r\n\r\nCurrently the endpoint is never called. I'll create a separate PR implementing the frontend work under a feature flag, and when/if the SIP is approved we can default to the new endpoint and remove the feature flag.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests for the functionality, ensuring that the download has all the metadata. In the process I fixed some of the unit tests so that they don't have side effects, since running tests in isolation was giving different results than running all of them.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [X] Has associated issue:
