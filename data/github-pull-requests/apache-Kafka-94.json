Unclean Leader Election, there could be data loss due to truncation at the resigned leader.\r\nThis PR tries to add more logs to understand the scale of message loss during an unclean leader election.\r\n\r\nSuppose there are 3 brokers that has replicas for a given partition:\r\nBroker A (leader) with largest offset 9 (log end offset 10)\r\nBroker B (follower) with largest offset 4 (log end offset 5)\r\nBroker C (follower) with largest offset 1 (log end offset 2)\r\n\r\nOnly the leader A is in the ISR with B and C lagging behind.\r\nNow an unclean leader election causes the leadership to be transferred to C. Broker A would need to truncate 8 messages, and Broker B 3 messages.\r\n\r\nCase 1: if these messages have been produced with acks=0 or 1, then clients would experience 8 lost messages.\r\nCase 2: if the client is using acks=all and the partition's minISR setting is 2, and further let's assume broker B dropped out of the ISR after receiving the message with offset 4, then only the messages with offset<=4 have been acked to the client. The truncation effectively causes the client to lose 3 messages.\r\n\r\nKnowing the exact amount of data loss involves knowing the client's acks setting when the messages are produced, and also whether the messages have been sufficiently replicated according to the MinISR setting.\r\nWithout getting too involved, this PR reduces the requirement from getting the exact data loss numbers to getting an ESTIMATE of the data loss.\r\nSpecifically this PR adds logs during truncation to show the log end offset, number of messages truncated, and number of bytes truncated.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nI manually tested a ULE case where the resigned leader contains two more messages than the newly elected leader, and saw the following log on the resigned leader\r\n[2020-10-29 15:43:50,154] INFO [Log partition=topic0-0, dir=/tmp/kafka-logs-0] Truncated to offset 0 from the log end offset 2 with 2 messages and 85 bytes truncated (kafka.log.Log)\r\n\r\nThe bytes truncated match the result shown by the kafka-dump-log.sh script before the truncation\r\nStarting offset: 0\r\nbaseOffset: 0 lastOffset: 1 count: 2 baseSequence: -1 lastSequence: -1 producerId: -1 producerEpoch: -1

initializing the raft state machine after shutting down as a leader, we were previously entering the \"unattached\" state, which means we have no leader and no voted candidate. This was a bug because it allowed a reinitialized leader to cast a vote for a candidate in the same epoch that it was already the leader of. This patch fixes the problem by introducing a new \"resigned\" state which allows us to retain the leader state so that we cannot change our vote and we will not accept additional appends.\r\n\r\nThis patch also revamps the shutdown logic to make use of the new \"resigned\" state. Previously we had a separate path in `KafkaRaftClient.poll` for the shutdown logic which resulted in some duplication. Instead now we incorporate shutdown behavior into each state's respective logic.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

```@Test(expected = Exception.class)``` is replaced by ```assertThrows```\r\n1. remove reference to ```org.scalatest.Assertions``` \r\n1. change the magic code from 1 to 2 for ```testAppendAtInvalidOffset``` to test ZSTD\r\n1. rename ```testMaybeAddPartitionToTransactionXXXX``` to ```testNotReadyForSendXXX```\r\n1. increase maxBlockMs from 1s to 3s to avoid unexpected timeout from ```TransactionsTest#testTimeout``` \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

These interfaces and implementations are low level API for writing and reading snapshots. They are internal to the Raft implementation and are not exposed to the users of `RaftClient`. They operation at the `Record` level. These types are exposed to the `RaftClient` through the `ReplicatedLog` interface.\r\n\r\n2. Adds a buffered snapshot writer: `SnapshotWriter<T>`. This type is a higher-level type and it is exposed through the `RaftClient` interface. A future PR will add the related `SnapshotReader<T>`, which will be used by the state machine to load a snapshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

1.4.5-6 allocates large internal buffers inside of ZstdInputStream and ZstdOutputStream. This caused a lot of allocation and GC activity when creating and closing the streams. It also does not buffer the reads or writes. This causes inefficiency when DefaultRecord.writeTo() does a series of small single bytes reads using various ByteUtils methods. The JNI is more efficient if the writes of uncompressed data were flushed in large pieces rather than for each byte. This is due to the the expense of context switching between the Java code and the native code. This is also the case when reading as well. Per https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/issues/141 the maintainer of zstd-jni and I agreed to not buffer reads and writes in favor of having the caller do that, so here we are updating the caller. Here is part of a flame graph of  CPU time spent in the single byte writes from Kafka:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1082334/97130235-3113cd00-1717-11eb-835c-cc145d549604.png)\r\n\r\nIn this patch, I upgraded to the most recent zstd-jni version with the buffer reuse built-in. This was done in https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/pull/143 and https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/pull/146 Since we decided not to add additional buffering of input/output with zstd-jni, I added the BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream to CompressionType.ZSTD just like we currently do for CompressionType.GZIP which also is inefficient for single byte reads and writes. I used the same buffer sizes as that existing implementation.\r\n\r\nNOTE: if so desired we could pass a wrapped BufferSupplier into the Zstd*Stream classes to have Kafka decide how the buffer recycling occurs. This functionality was added in the latter PR linked above. I am holding off on this since based on jmh benchmarking the performance gains were not clear and personally I don't know if it worth the complexity of trying to hack around the reflection at this point in time. The zstd-jni uses a very similar default recycler as snappy does currently which seems to provide decent efficiency. While this PR fixes the defect, I feel that using BufferSupplier in both zstd-jni and snappy is outside of the scope of this bugfix and should be considered a separate improvement. I would prefer this change get merged in on its own since the performance gains here are very significant relative to the more incremental and minor optimizations which could be achieved by doing that separate work.\r\n\r\nThere are some noticeable improvements in the JMH benchmarks (excerpt):\r\n\r\nBEFORE:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark

PR replaces #9470 as I needed to do some cleanup of my repo and break this into its own branch so it did not block everything else. Also I have created Jira request [KAFKA-10640](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10640) to cover a requirement for this change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have added support for the `Cast` and `ReplaceField` transformations to recursively traverse the structure of messages (both with and without a schema) and perform the Cast or Replace operations on matching child primitive fields if they are found at any level nested within the structure.  Nested parents of all currently-supported Connect complex types should be supported (Map, Array, or Struct) but most of the primitive field handling is still similar to before (the lowest level within the nesting would normally be a Struct when using Schema or Map when schemaless).\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be controlled by a new configuration parameter called `recursive` for both transformations.  The default setting is **false** so any existing connectors would not be impacted -- you must set the parameter to **true** in order for the child complex types to be traversed.  Otherwise, the default behavior should be the same as before.\r\n\r\nI have also cleaned up the Config names a bit to match some of the other transformations (namely, using a class interface called `ConfigName` which can be accessed statically), it is a bit nicer to work with and brings a little more consistency across the different built-in transforms.\r\n\r\nSince this is more than just a trivial change, I have created a few new unit tests, some of them quite complex, to try and make sure that everything is working ok compared to before.  I have also been running both of these as custom SMTs against data in our production kafka cluster and used some learnings there to iron out a few issues.  I have had tens of millions of events actually using this updated code so I think/hope the changes are pretty well-tested but welcome if there is some kind of feedback or concern with them!\r\n\r\nHere is a full list of everything that I have changed:\r\n\r\n### Cast\r\n\r\n#### Added new Config Parameters:\r\n- `recursive` optional boolean, default = `false`\r\n- `complex.string.as.json` optional boolean, default = `false`\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n- Created new public static interface `ConfigName` and marked the old public static string `SPEC_CONFIG` as deprecated (so it can still be used for a while until it is removed later).\r\n- Added new `ConfigName` for `SPEC`, `RECURSIVE`, and `COMPLEX_STRING_AS_JSON`\r\n- Created new interface `ConfigDefault` to provide an easy way to set and consume default values for these two new optional configuration parameters.\r\n- And then of course defined and set up the config parameters for usage within the rest of the class.\r\n- Added ARRAY, MAP, and STRUCT as valid types to convert FROM (but the only thing they can convert TO is STRING, otherwise if your `SPEC` tries to convert them to something else it will throw a `DataException`).  Before you would receive a `DataException` if you tried to include a complex type in the `SPEC` but now at least you are given the option to Cast them to a string!\r\n- Refactored the `apply...` methods so that they will call a child method that recursively builds the structure of the schema or value depending if the user sets the `recursive` config parameter to true (otherwise it should basically work the same as before -- look at everything that is at the top level of the structure and then return).  There are new methods for recursively handling different type of structures but in the end the same basic flow happens at each child level as what was happening before (`for each field in fields...`). \r\n   - However, one change in the design is that when building the new Value, instead of looping through each field from the new schema and performing an `oldstruct.get(oldfield)`, it instead will loop again through each field in the old schema.  This is so that nested primitive conversions happen correctly and what happens in the Value should be exactly the same thing that happened in the Schema.\r\n- When a child schema is created as part of the recursion, it is also added to the `schemaUpdateCache`, and the recursive methods call `getOrBuildUpdatedSchema` so they should fetch it from the cast in case it has already been converted.  This is the same when child values are converted -- they should fetch their new child schemas from the cache instead of building them again.\r\n- Added usage of an instance of `JsonConverter` and `JsonDeserializer` if you wish to have the complex types toString come out in a JSON text format instead of the Java object's toString() implementation.  This is helpful for scenarios for example like using a JdbcSinkConnector where you have an array of structs as one field in your source, you can put these values into a database table as a blob of JSON text, then parse these values as JSON (for example PostgreSQL has loads of really good JSON parsing).  This behavior is controlled by the new configuration parameter `complex.string.as.json` but again by default it is set to false (so you have to set to true in order to use this).\r\n- I also changed `castValueToType` from `private static` to `private`.  This was so that we can allow a check in this method on the instance value of our new `complex.string.as.json` configuration parameter and decide to call `castToJsonString` instead of the old `castToString` method.\r\n  - I realize this one can maybe be a bit controversial, and there were several options I considered.  First, however, I tried to examine any public static method or property of any kind and see if anything ever makes use of `castValueToType` and could not see any (please mention if you see something I missed).  So a change from private static to private in this case seems very minor and should not impact any functionality -- nothing else can see or use it anyway outside of this class itself.\r\n  - Another option is possibly a bit more like the `TimestampConverter` transform, where they have created a private instance of a `Config` subclass and then pass the entire instance to some of the static methods.  But I think that change would have to \"touch\"  a lot more places, and given the point above (I did not see where it was actually used anywhere from anything public static ) this seemed like a bit too much of a rebuild.\r\n  - Also usage of this `castToJsonString` with using the `JsonConverter` and `JsonDeserializer` could be done a few other ways... but this was the one that I felt tried to use existing functionalities within Connect and was the \"cleanest\" looking that I could initially come up with from a code perspective.  And the reason to use a single private instance of the classes was to try and save a bit on resources -- it is possible that you will have multiple Json string conversions even within one record so I thought it was better to only have one instance we can re-use over and over.\r\n- Changed the log level for the Cast log message from Trace to Debug (this seems like something you definitely want to see in Debug and not just Trace!).\r\n- Added new test cases for casting Arrays and Maps to string, to JSON Strings, as well as for working with different types of recursive records (both with and without schema).  In these tests, I found that a lot of the weird issues only happen once you go a few levels deep so I have made the tests a little more complicated to ensure that everything was working properly even with multiple nested levels.\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\r\n  \"connector.class\": \"FileStreamSink\",\r\n  \"topics\": \"test\",\r\n  \"file\": \"/tmp/cast.txt\",\r\n  \"transforms\": \"cast\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.type\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Cast$Value\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.spec\": \"child_int:string,child_array_of_structs:string\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.recursive\": \"true\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.complex.string.as.json\": \"true\"\r\n}' http://localhost:8083/connectors/filestreamsink_cast_test/config\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### ReplaceField\r\n\r\n#### Added new Config Parameters:\r\n- `recursive` optional boolean, default = `false`\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n- A lot of the changes here are very similar to what was done in `Cast`.  In fact, even before my changes, the flow of these two transforms was actually almost identical, so it worked quite well to do them both like this at the same time and they are easily used together in transform chains within Connect.\r\n- Namely, there is a new `recursive` configuration parameter and the `apply...` methods have been updated to recursively call methods to build the new target schema and values.  A lot of the code is exactly the same so you should even find direct copy-paste from `Cast` to here and using a lot of the same private object names, methods, etc.\r\n   - Note also that the pattern follows the same as with `Cast` -- looping through the old schema and converted child values based on the old structure instead of first creating a new schema and then getting the old field.  This new flow also means that the `reverseRenamed` method and its `reverseRenames` map are no longer needed either (but I left them in for now).\r\n- Added a logger instance and added Debug-level logging for a few different events, such as when a field is excluded or included, or when it is renamed.  So some of the methods were refactored a bit in order to provide this logging (for example the `filter` and `renamed` methods).\r\n- I also added support when using `renames` for a \"contains exactly one of\" kind of scenario.  What I mean by this is that in your schema, you have several fields which you know by design that only one of them will have a value, and when that one has a value, all of the rest within that group will be null.  The change to this transform now allows you to specify a target name more than one time, but when the value transform is occurring, if more than one of them have a value then it will throw a `DataException`.  Before, the transform would throw a `DataException` when building the new schema based on the `renames` config (trying to add a duplicate field to the schema) but instead now this check happens when building the updated value instead.\r\n- Also added a few unit tests to handle new scenarios and recursive operation (both with and without schemas).\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\r\n  \"connector.class\": \"FileStreamSink\",\r\n  \"topics\": \"test\",\r\n  \"file\": \"/tmp/replace.txt\",\r\n  \"transforms\": \"replace\",\r\n  \"transforms.replace.type\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ReplaceField$Value\",\r\n  \"transforms.replace.renames\": \"child_value_one:child_value,child_value_two:child_value\",\r\n  \"transforms.replace.recursive\": \"true\",\r\n}' http://localhost:8083/connectors/filestreamsink_replace_test/config\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this covers everything but if you have any questions or concerns then please feel free to ask!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

have made an update to **TimestampConverter** Connect transform to address the main issues that I logged in [KAFKA-10627](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10627).\r\n\r\nNamely, that it now ...\r\n\r\n- supports multiple fields via a new configuration parameter `fields` as a comma-separated list of field names. The old parameter `field` is still supported for compatibility but the value is moved to the new parameter.\r\n- supports a DateTimeFormatter-compatible pattern string that can support multiple timestamp formats for parsing input of string values to whatever target you configure (e.g. parsing strings to Timestamp type).\r\n   - `format` config is now split into two: `format.input` and `format.output` but you can still just send `format` by itself if you do not need to use a more complicated input pattern. When providing only `format`, the string pattern which you provide will be used for both `format.input` and `format.output`.\r\n\r\nI realized that kafka is using `java.util.Date` everywhere and as part of its core types (including in Schemas, values, etc).  In theory it would be good over time to upgrade to `java.time` classes but on first reflection it seems like quite a big overhaul to do this.\r\n\r\nSo instead I focused on the specific problem at hand: parsing strings into `Date` where the strings can come in different formats.  So for this part alone I changed to use `DateTimeFormatter` so we can use multiple patterns to match input strings and convert them to a `java.util.Date` after.\r\n\r\nI also updated some of the way the Config parameters and values work, to bring in line with the other classes and similar to what I did with #9470.\r\n\r\n#### String Input and Output Timestamp Format updates\r\n\r\nBecause now for input formats we allow multiple different possibilities using pattern matching, this does not work for the output format of a Timestamp to a String (which was another possibility of this transform).  So I have changed the configuration a bit... now there are three parameters:\r\n\r\n- `format` which is the original one. You can still use this one, and it will set both input (parsing) and output (Date/Timestamp to string format) based on this format.\r\n- `format.input` is a new parameter, where you can specify a DateTimeFormatter-compatible pattern string that supports multiple different formats in case you have a mix in your data.  For just one example, now you can use something like this as `format.input` and it will catch a lot of different variations which you might see in one timestamp field: `\"[yyyy-MM-dd[['T'][ ]HH:mm:ss[.SSSSSSSz][.SSS[XXX][X]]]]\"`\r\n- `format.output` is a new parameter which only controls the output of a Date/Timestamp to target type of `string`. This is the same as before and still uses `SimpleDateFormat` to create the output string, it is just controlled in a separate parameter now.\r\n\r\nI also added some code which checks the value of each of these three.  Basically it forces you to use either `format`, or one or both of the new parameters -- you cannot mix the old and new together.  In the end, `format.input` and `format.output` are the ones used in the rest of the logic, but the code first compares `format` against these values and sets the value for both of the new parameters depending on what was sent in the config.\r\n\r\n#### Support for multiple fields instead of one single field\r\n\r\nI changed the `field` parameter to now be called `fields` and supports multiple values as a comma-separated list.  I used this new `ConfigUtils.translateDeprecatedConfigs` method to provide automatic translation of of the old parameter to the new one as well.\r\n\r\nWith this change I also updated the `apply` methods so that they loop through each field and check against the list of `fields`.  Now you can specify a comma-separated list of multiple fields to have the same input format/output type applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added for both new updates (string formatting and multiple field support).\r\n\r\nAs I looked at this one then I realized that maybe it would be good to add `recursive` support similar to what I have done in #9470 but I guess that can come at another day!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

version 0.7.10 pinned paramiko to version 2.3.2 to deal with random `SSHException`s confluent had been seeing since ducktape was updated to a later version of paramiko.\r\nThis PR pins both the version in `setup.py` and in `ducker-ak`'s `Dockerfile` to the same version. Previously ducker version was pinned to 0.8.0. \r\nI'll send a separate PR that pins both versions to 0.8.0 (unless someone is already working on that separately) - the idea is that we can backport ducktape 0.7.10 change as far back as possible, while keep the ducktape 0.8.0 change in trunk only (unless we plan to backport python3 changes).\r\n\r\nTested:\r\nhttp://confluent-kafka-branch-builder-system-test-results.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2020-10-23--001.1603440055--stan-confluent--ducktape-710--3c51234d0/report.html\r\n\r\nThere are 10 failing tests, 9 of which have been failing before this change, and 1 (streams_upgrade_test) I've seen failing on different branches recently as well, though it was passing on trunk as of couple of days ago.

PR introduces a streams specific uncaught exception handler that currently has the option to close the client or the application. If the new handler is set as well as the old handler (java thread handler) will be ignored and an error will be logged. \r\nThe application shutdown is achieved through the rebalance protocol. \r\n\r\n\r\nTesting is done through a series of integration tests and unit tests. The Integration test make a processor that throws and StreamsException which triggers the handler. Then it verifies that Streams object is in the correct state and had reacted accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

#9418, we add a listener to the `RaftClient` interface. In that patch, we used it only to send commit notifications for writes from the leader. In this PR, we extend the `handleCommit` API to accept all committed data and we remove the pull-based `read` API. Additionally, we add two new callbacks to the listener interface in order to notify the state machine when the raft client has claimed or resigned leadership.\r\n\r\nFinally, this patch allows the `RaftClient` to support multiple listeners. This is necessary for KIP-500 because we will have one listener for the controller role and one for the broker role.\r\n\r\nNote this patch builds on top of #9418. Once merged, I will rebase this patch and remove draft status.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

have added support for the `Cast` and `ReplaceField` transformations to recursively traverse the structure of messages (both with and without a schema) and perform the Cast or Replace operations on matching child primitive fields if they are found at any level nested within the structure.  Nested parents of all currently-supported Connect complex types should be supported (Map, Array, or Struct) but most of the primitive field handling is still similar to before (the lowest level within the nesting would normally be a Struct when using Schema or Map when schemaless).\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be controlled by a new configuration parameter called `recursive` for both transformations.  The default setting is **false** so any existing connectors would not be impacted -- you must set the parameter to **true** in order for the child complex types to be traversed.  Otherwise, the default behavior should be the same as before.\r\n\r\nI have also cleaned up the Config names a bit to match some of the other transformations (namely, using a class interface called `ConfigName` which can be accessed statically), it is a bit nicer to work with and brings a little more consistency across the different built-in transforms.\r\n\r\nSince this is more than just a trivial change, I have created a few new unit tests, some of them quite complex, to try and make sure that everything is working ok compared to before.  I have also been running both of these as custom SMTs against data in our production kafka cluster and used some learnings there to iron out a few issues.  I have had tens of millions of events actually using this updated code so I think/hope the changes are pretty well-tested but welcome if there is some kind of feedback or concern with them!\r\n\r\nHere is a full list of everything that I have changed:\r\n\r\n### Cast\r\n\r\n#### Added new Config Parameters:\r\n- `recursive` optional boolean, default = `false`\r\n- `complex.string.as.json` optional boolean, default = `false`\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n- Created new public static interface `ConfigName` and marked the old public static string `SPEC_CONFIG` as deprecated (so it can still be used for a while until it is removed later).\r\n- Added new `ConfigName` for `SPEC`, `RECURSIVE`, and `COMPLEX_STRING_AS_JSON`\r\n- Created new interface `ConfigDefault` to provide an easy way to set and consume default values for these two new optional configuration parameters.\r\n- And then of course defined and set up the config parameters for usage within the rest of the class.\r\n- Added ARRAY, MAP, and STRUCT as valid types to convert FROM (but the only thing they can convert TO is STRING, otherwise if your `SPEC` tries to convert them to something else it will throw a `DataException`).  Before you would receive a `DataException` if you tried to include a complex type in the `SPEC` but now at least you are given the option to Cast them to a string!\r\n- Refactored the `apply...` methods so that they will call a child method that recursively builds the structure of the schema or value depending if the user sets the `recursive` config parameter to true (otherwise it should basically work the same as before -- look at everything that is at the top level of the structure and then return).  There are new methods for recursively handling different type of structures but in the end the same basic flow happens at each child level as what was happening before (`for each field in fields...`). \r\n   - However, one change in the design is that when building the new Value, instead of looping through each field from the new schema and performing an `oldstruct.get(oldfield)`, it instead will loop again through each field in the old schema.  This is so that nested primitive conversions happen correctly and what happens in the Value should be exactly the same thing that happened in the Schema.\r\n- When a child schema is created as part of the recursion, it is also added to the `schemaUpdateCache`, and the recursive methods call `getOrBuildUpdatedSchema` so they should fetch it from the cast in case it has already been converted.  This is the same when child values are converted -- they should fetch their new child schemas from the cache instead of building them again.\r\n- Added usage of an instance of `JsonConverter` and `JsonDeserializer` if you wish to have the complex types toString come out in a JSON text format instead of the Java object's toString() implementation.  This is helpful for scenarios for example like using a JdbcSinkConnector where you have an array of structs as one field in your source, you can put these values into a database table as a blob of JSON text, then parse these values as JSON (for example PostgreSQL has loads of really good JSON parsing).  This behavior is controlled by the new configuration parameter `complex.string.as.json` but again by default it is set to false (so you have to set to true in order to use this).\r\n- I also changed `castValueToType` from `private static` to `private`.  This was so that we can allow a check in this method on the instance value of our new `complex.string.as.json` configuration parameter and decide to call `castToJsonString` instead of the old `castToString` method.\r\n  - I realize this one can maybe be a bit controversial, and there were several options I considered.  First, however, I tried to examine any public static method or property of any kind and see if anything ever makes use of `castValueToType` and could not see any (please mention if you see something I missed).  So a change from private static to private in this case seems very minor and should not impact any functionality -- nothing else can see or use it anyway outside of this class itself.\r\n  - Another option is possibly a bit more like the `TimestampConverter` transform, where they have created a private instance of a `Config` subclass and then pass the entire instance to some of the static methods.  But I think that change would have to \"touch\"  a lot more places, and given the point above (I did not see where it was actually used anywhere from anything public static ) this seemed like a bit too much of a rebuild.\r\n  - Also usage of this `castToJsonString` with using the `JsonConverter` and `JsonDeserializer` could be done a few other ways... but this was the one that I felt tried to use existing functionalities within Connect and was the \"cleanest\" looking that I could initially come up with from a code perspective.  And the reason to use a single private instance of the classes was to try and save a bit on resources -- it is possible that you will have multiple Json string conversions even within one record so I thought it was better to only have one instance we can re-use over and over.\r\n- Changed the log level for the Cast log message from Trace to Debug (this seems like something you definitely want to see in Debug and not just Trace!).\r\n- Added new test cases for casting Arrays and Maps to string, to JSON Strings, as well as for working with different types of recursive records (both with and without schema).  In these tests, I found that a lot of the weird issues only happen once you go a few levels deep so I have made the tests a little more complicated to ensure that everything was working properly even with multiple nested levels.\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\r\n  \"connector.class\": \"FileStreamSink\",\r\n  \"topics\": \"test\",\r\n  \"file\": \"/tmp/cast.txt\",\r\n  \"transforms\": \"cast\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.type\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Cast$Value\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.spec\": \"child_int:string,child_array_of_structs:string\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.recursive\": \"true\",\r\n  \"transforms.cast.complex.string.as.json\": \"true\"\r\n}' http://localhost:8083/connectors/filestreamsink_cast_test/config\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### ReplaceField\r\n\r\n#### Added new Config Parameters:\r\n- `recursive` optional boolean, default = `false`\r\n\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n- A lot of the changes here are very similar to what was done in `Cast`.  In fact, even before my changes, the flow of these two transforms was actually almost identical, so it worked quite well to do them both like this at the same time and they are easily used together in transform chains within Connect.\r\n- Namely, there is a new `recursive` configuration parameter and the `apply...` methods have been updated to recursively call methods to build the new target schema and values.  A lot of the code is exactly the same so you should even find direct copy-paste from `Cast` to here and using a lot of the same private object names, methods, etc.\r\n   - Note also that the pattern follows the same as with `Cast` -- looping through the old schema and converted child values based on the old structure instead of first creating a new schema and then getting the old field.  This new flow also means that the `reverseRenamed` method and its `reverseRenames` map are no longer needed either (but I left them in for now).\r\n- Added a logger instance and added Debug-level logging for a few different events, such as when a field is excluded or included, or when it is renamed.  So some of the methods were refactored a bit in order to provide this logging (for example the `filter` and `renamed` methods).\r\n- I also added support when using `renames` for a \"contains exactly one of\" kind of scenario.  What I mean by this is that in your schema, you have several fields which you know by design that only one of them will have a value, and when that one has a value, all of the rest within that group will be null.  The change to this transform now allows you to specify a target name more than one time, but when the value transform is occurring, if more than one of them have a value then it will throw a `DataException`.  Before, the transform would throw a `DataException` when building the new schema based on the `renames` config (trying to add a duplicate field to the schema) but instead now this check happens when building the updated value instead.\r\n- Also added a few unit tests to handle new scenarios and recursive operation (both with and without schemas).\r\n\r\n#### Example Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\r\n  \"connector.class\": \"FileStreamSink\",\r\n  \"topics\": \"test\",\r\n  \"file\": \"/tmp/replace.txt\",\r\n  \"transforms\": \"replace\",\r\n  \"transforms.replace.type\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.ReplaceField$Value\",\r\n  \"transforms.replace.renames\": \"child_value_one:child_value,child_value_two:child_value\",\r\n  \"transforms.replace.recursive\": \"true\",\r\n}' http://localhost:8083/connectors/filestreamsink_replace_test/config\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this covers everything but if you have any questions or

This PR creates the class, modifies code to use the class in the message protocol and changes the code surrounding the existing messages/json that used the old UUID class.\r\n\r\nSimpleExampleMessage was used only for testing, so all usages of UUID have been switched to the new class.\r\n\r\nSubscriptionInfoData uses UUID for processId extensively. It also utilizes java.util.UUID implementation of Comparable<UUID> so that UUIDs can be ordered. I felt that this functionality was not necessary for the UUIDs used for topic IDs so I decided to convert to java.util.UUID on the boundary of SubscriptionInfoData. I was only able to find the sorting necessary for testing, though, so this still may be changed.\r\n\r\nI also added tests for the methods of the new UUID class. The existing SimpleExampleMessage tests should be sufficient for testing the new UUID class in message protocols.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

followup to KAFKA-10559\r\n\r\nI noticed that we were converting any and all TaskAssignmentException to the INCOMPLETE_SOURCE_TOPIC_METADATA error code to shut down all the clients. Since these errors are typically fatal, it does seem appropriate to propagate the shutdown command. But we should do so with a new AssignorError instead of piggy-backing on the INCOMPLETE_SOURCE_TOPIC_METADATA, which would be pretty confusing for users who do in fact have all their source topics.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n- Add new AssignorError.ASSIGNMENT_ERROR for generic assignment errors\r\n- Missing source topics --> throw/catch MissingSourceTopicException --> INCOMPLETE_SOURCE_TOPIC_METADATA \r\n- Internal assignment errors --> throw/catch TaskAssignmentException --> ASSIGNMENT_ERROR\r\n\r\nShould be cherry-picked to
