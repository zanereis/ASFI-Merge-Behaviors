definition of next for a byte key is incorrectly set as old key + 1 when treating the key as the next smallest value, for example:\r\n0x01 is the next key for 0x00\r\n\r\nThe ByteKey compareTo operator treats two keys where one key is the proper prefix of the other as smaller hence 0x01 is greater then 0x00, but so is 0x0000 thus next is skipping over 0x0000 as the next smallest key larger then 0x00.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes

This can delay the pipeline for large inputs, and does not guarantee that the schema is ready (if it is created in the same pipeline) for small inputs.\r\n\r\nIt also breaks streaming mode completely as the input PCollection is never closed.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional parameter with a PCollection to wait for before reading the schema. If not specified, the schema is read immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Batch Mutations by bundle\r\nPreviously the entire input was scanned, assigned partitions and GroupByKey before writing. This required that the input was bounded, large amounts of disk space, and the entire input had to be read before any writes started.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the input is only sorted/batched over the current Bundle (or 1000x max batch size, whichever is smaller).\r\n\r\nThis has the following benefits: \r\n\r\n- Significantly decreases latency before the first row is written (down to a few seconds after the pipeline is started)\r\n- Allows the SpannerIO writer to be used in a streaming pipeline\r\n- Reduces the amount of worker disk space required for large sources\r\n- Significantly improves the write speed for large sources\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes PR #6422 and #6409 \r\n\r\n@chamikaramj \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all `standard_library.import_aliases()` calls because its changes are too implicit. Especially since the `install_aliases()` call seems to also have effect on any modules imported from the module with the call.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like none of these calls were actually needed, but were added by the automatic conversion via the futurize tool.\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @charlesccychen @aaltay \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

that this change modifies the @ProcessElement method to require users to use RestrictionTracker\r\ninstead of a concrete sub-type.\r\n\r\nThis change enables us to remove the synchronization requirement for users as we will\r\nwrap the underlying restriction tracker allowing us to add appropriate synchronization as\r\nneeded and also to watch any calls that pass through the object such as the claim calls.\r\n\r\nRestrictionTrackers was placed within sdks/java/fn-execution since watching claim observers will\r\nbe needed within the Java SDK harness in addition to the legacy implementation found in runners/core-java.\r\n\r\nEventually the code can be moved out of sdks/java/fn-execution and placed only within the SDK harness\r\nitself once all pipelines run portably.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes

a `location` init kwarg and attribute to `BigQuerySource` to allow specifying the location explicitly for query-source instances.~\r\n- ~In `BigQueryReader._get_source_table_location`: Fall back to using `self.source.location`  if `self.source.table_reference` is `None`.~\r\n- Run the query using `dryRun=True` to get a list of referenced tables from the query, get the locations of all referenced tables and verify that they either are the same or that no tables were referenced.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\nFixing the tests for Python 3 requires a lot of cross-package fixes. I'm therefore submitting this PR with the failing tests skipped during Python 3 testing. This will allow us to build on these fixes while porting the other packages. Since the remaining errors might be caused by other packages, porting of these packages might already solve some of these errors.\r\n\r\nIn a later stage, these errors should be un-skipped and fixed if they are still failing.\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @charlesccychen @aaltay \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

was disabled as it was behaving erratically: testCheckpointMark was randomly failing with unexpected queue sizes. \r\n\r\nThis would appear to be a consequence of the default ActiveMQ connection factory setting which sees acknowledgement messages sent and processed asynchronously. With this configuration it would be possible that an assertion against queue size could be performed before previous acknowledgements sent via a different connection had been processed.\r\n\r\nThe fix is a simple change to the connection URL query string, adding sendAcksAsync=false (http://activemq.apache.org/maven/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/ActiveMQConnectionFactory.html#isSendAcksAsync--) in order to ensure that acknowledgements are processed before subsequent test assertions.\r\n\r\n@jbonofre \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

is is part of a series of PRs with goal to make Apache Beam PY3 compatible. The proposal with the outlined approach has been documented [here](https://s.apache.org/beam-python-3).\r\n\r\nFixing the tests for Python 3 requires a lot of cross-package fixes. I'm therefore submitting this PR with the failing tests skipped during Python 3 testing. This will allow us to build on these fixes while porting the other packages. Since the remaining errors might be caused by other packages, porting of these packages might already solve some of these errors.\r\n\r\nIn a later stage, these errors should be un-skipped and fixed if they are still failing.\r\n\r\n2 tests were skipped in this PR:\r\n- test_side_input_tagged (apache_beam.pipeline_test.DoFnTest)\r\n- test_side_input_no_tag (apache_beam.pipeline_test.DoFnTest)\r\n\r\n@tvalentyn @Fematich @charlesccychen @aaltay \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

behavior waits for the entire input PCollection to be read\r\nand closed before reading the Schema. This can delay the pipeline\r\nfor large inputs, and does not guarantee that the schema is ready\r\n(if it is created in the same pipeline) for small inputs.\r\n\r\nIt also breaks streaming mode completely as the input PCollection\r\nis never closed. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds an optional parameter with a PCollection to wait for\r\nbefore reading the schema. If not specified, the schema is read\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThis provides a partial -- but not complete -- fix for streaming mode (there are still issues with the partitioning/grouping in streaming mode which means that NPE's will be thrown with more than trivial load).\r\n\r\n@chamikaramj \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
