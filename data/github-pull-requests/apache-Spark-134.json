What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `InternalSequenceBase` to pass a time-zone aware value to `DateTimeUtils#timestampAddInterval`, rather than a time-zone agnostic value, when performing `Date` arithmetic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following query gets the wrong answer if run in the America/Los_Angeles time zone:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select sequence(date '2021-01-01', date '2022-01-01', interval '3' month) x;\r\n[2021-01-01,2021-03-31,2021-06-30,2021-09-30,2022-01-01]\r\nTime taken: 0.664 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> \r\n```\r\nThe answer should be\r\n```\r\n[2021-01-01,2021-04-01,2021-07-01,2021-10-01,2022-01-01]\r\n```\r\n`InternalSequenceBase` converts the date to micros by multiplying days by micros per day. This converts the date into a time-zone agnostic timestamp. However, `InternalSequenceBase` uses `DateTimeUtils#timestampAddInterval` to perform the arithmetic, and that function assumes a _time-zone aware_ timestamp.\r\n\r\nOne simple fix would be to call `DateTimeUtils#timestampNTZAddInterval` instead for date arithmetic. However, Spark date arithmetic is typically time-zone aware (see the comment in the test added by this PR), so this PR converts the date to a time-zone aware value before calling `DateTimeUtils#timestampAddInterval`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR modifies type inference for python lists to consider all values in the list, not just the first value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis enables convenient type inference in the two following cases:\r\n|  | previous | current |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `[None, 1]` | `array<void>` (raises `ValueError`) | `array<bigint>` |\r\n| `[{\"b\": 1}, {\"c\": 2}]` | `array<struct<b:bigint>>`  | `array<struct<b:bigint,c:bigint>>`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nPossible user-facing changes:\r\n* attempting to infer the schema of an array with mixed types (e.g. `[\"a\", 1]`) may result in a TypeError\r\n   * previously, this was inferred as an `array<string>` and produced a value `[\"a\", \"1\"]`\r\n* fields of inferred struct types will differ if dictionaries in an array have different keys\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests for various cases.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-13T20:28:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T01:07:30Z","closed_at":"2022-05-19T01:06:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b83f273020f6885a1af6a0611fee4ff2e8697b52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cde786d3cf40e6cfbfbd42cff513d94b2003c06","head":{"label":"physinet:infer_schema_from_full_array","ref":"infer_schema_from_full_array","sha":"7cde786d3cf40e6cfbfbd42cff513d94b2003c06","user":{"login":"physinet","id":14351965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet","html_url":"https://github.com/physinet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":394416823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ0MTY4MjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"physinet/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"physinet","id":14351965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet","html_url":"https://github.com/physinet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/physinet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/physinet/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR simplifies the planning of limit and offset:\r\n1. Unify the semantics of physical plans that need to deal with limit + offset. These physical plans always do limit first, then offset. The planner rule should set limit and offset properly, for different plans, such as limit + offset and offset + limit.\r\n2. Refactor the planner rule `SpecialLimit` to reuse the code of planning `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec`.\r\n3. Let `GlobalLimitExec` to handle offset as well, so that we can remove `GlobalLimitAndOffsetExec`. This matches `CollectLimitExec`.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode simplification\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch `java.lang.IllegalStateException` and `java.lang.AssertionError` (raised by asserts), and wrap them by Spark's exception w/ the `INTERNAL_ERROR` error class. The modification affects only actions so far.\r\n\r\nThis PR affects the case of missing bucket file. After the changes, Spark throws `SparkException` w/ `INTERNAL_ERROR` instead of `IllegalStateException`. Since this is not Spark's illegal state, the exception should be replaced by another runtime exception. Created the ticket SPARK-39163 to fix this.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36500.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL and unify representation of internal errors by using error classes like for other errors. Usually, users shouldn't observe asserts and illegal states, but even if such situation happens, they should see errors in the same way as other errors (w/ error class `INTERNAL_ERROR`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. At least, in one particular case, see the modified test suites and SPARK-39163.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.BucketedReadWithoutHiveSupportSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.AdaptiveQueryExecSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.WholeStageCodegenSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace all invokes of `sys.error()` by throwing of `IllegalStateException` in the `sql` namespace.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36524.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the context of wrapping all internal errors like asserts/illegal state exceptions (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36500), it is impossible to distinguish `RuntimeException` of `sys.error()` from Spark's exceptions like `SparkRuntimeException`. The last one can be propagated to the user space but `sys.error` exceptions shouldn't be visible to users in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, shouldn't. sys.error shouldn't propagate exception to user space in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, for most of the cases, the project https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38615 is able to show where the runtime errors happen within the original query.\r\nHowever, after trying on production, I found that the following queries won't show where the divide by 0 error happens\r\n```\r\ncreate table aggTest(i int, j int, k int, d date) using parquet\r\ninsert into aggTest values(1, 2, 0, date'2022-01-01')\r\nselect sum(j)/sum(k),percentile(i, 0.9) from aggTest group by d\r\n```\r\nWith `percentile` function in the query, the plan can't execute with whole stage codegen. Thus the child plan of `Project` is serialized to executors for execution, from ProjectExec:\r\n```\r\n  protected override def doExecute(): RDD[InternalRow] = {\r\n    child.execute().mapPartitionsWithIndexInternal { (index, iter) =>\r\n      val project = UnsafeProjection.create(projectList, child.output)\r\n      project.initialize(index)\r\n      iter.map(project)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `TreeNode.origin` is not serialized to executors since `TreeNode` doesn't extend the trait `Serializable`, which results in an empty query context on errors. For more details, please read https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39140\r\n\r\nA dummy fix is to make `TreeNode` extend the trait `Serializable`. However, it can be performance regression if the query text is long (every `TreeNode` carries it for serialization). \r\nA better fix is to introduce a new trait `SupportQueryContext` and materialize the truncated query context for special expressions. This PR targets on binary arithmetic expressions only. I will create follow-ups for the remaining expressions which support runtime error query context.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove the error context framework and make sure it works when whole stage codegen is not available.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace all invokes of `sys.error()` by throwing of `IllegalStateException` in the `sql` namespace.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the context of wrapping all internal errors like asserts/illegal state exceptions (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36500), it is impossible to distinguish `RuntimeException` of `sys.error()` from Spark's exceptions like `SparkRuntimeException`. The last one can be propagated to the user space but `sys.error` exceptions shouldn't be visible to users in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, shouldn't. sys.error shouldn't propagate exception to user space in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites.","created_at":"2022-05-12T12:36:53Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T15:11:49Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T15:11:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e8bf87b9ab9678045ea1151e1765cd722ea628a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRegardless of whether the functions are ANSI or not, most databases are actually unsure of their support.\r\nSo we should add a new API into `JdbcDialect` so that jdbc dialect decide which function could be pushed down.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet function push-down more flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to revert commit 973ea0f06e72ab64574cbf00e095922a3415f864 from `branch-3.3` to exclude it from Apache Spark 3.3 scope.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-36837 tried to use Apache Kafka 3.1.0 at Apache Spark 3.3.0 and initially wanted to upgrade to Apache Kafka 3.3.1 before the official release. However, we can use the stable Apache Kafka 2.8.1 at Spark 3.3.0 and wait for more proven versions, Apache Kafka 3.2.x or 3.3.x.\r\n\r\nApache Kafka 3.2.0 vote is already passed and will arrive.\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-17993 introduce `ParquetLogRedirector` for Parquet version < 1.9, [PARQUET-305](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-305) change to use slf4j instead of jul in Parquet 1.9,  Spark uses Parquet 1.12.2 now  and [no longer relies on Parquet version 1.6](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30005) now , the `ParquetLogRedirector` is no longer needed, so this pr clean up the usage of `ParquetLogRedirector` in `ParquetFileFormat`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up the usage of `ParquetLogRedirector` in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix a bug in UPDATE commands with DEFAULT values.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the previous implementation of the `mapStructFieldNamesToExpressions` method associated column names with default values in the order of the keys in `Map[String, StructField]`. Since that's not always true, this PR updates that method to consume these columns in the order they actually appear in the target table schema instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug is fixed with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAn extra test exercises an error case that failed before, but is now fixed.","created_at":"2022-05-12T00:24:58Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T00:46:35Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T16:46:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ad4b7fa1c21299326de117ca68b51dd527cc07f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb52494c978df3ae474d4f10191dd9d47a3aac4e","head":{"label":"dtenedor:default-update-fix-bug","ref":"default-update-fix-bug","sha":"fb52494c978df3ae474d4f10191dd9d47a3aac4e","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6ddb5ae57665e10596182a0ed1d7c683be36078e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDeregistering disk persisted local blocks from the block manager in case of IO related errors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn case of a disk corruption a disk persisted block will lead to job failure as the block registration is always leads to the same file. So even when the task is rescheduled on a different executor the job will fail.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nFirst failure (the block is locally available):\r\n```\r\n22/04/25 07:15:28 ERROR executor.Executor: Exception in task 17024.0 in stage 12.0 (TID 51853)\r\njava.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 00000000\r\n  at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readStreamHeader(ObjectInputStream.java:943)\r\n  at java.io.ObjectInputStream.<init>(ObjectInputStream.java:401)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaDeserializationStream$$anon$1.<init>(JavaSerializer.scala:63)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaDeserializationStream.<init>(JavaSerializer.scala:63)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializerInstance.deserializeStream(JavaSerializer.scala:122)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.SerializerManager.dataDeserializeStream(SerializerManager.scala:209)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.getLocalValues(BlockManager.scala:617)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.getOrElseUpdate(BlockManager.scala:897)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.getOrCompute(RDD.scala:335)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.iterator(RDD.scala:286)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.MapPartitionsRDD.compute(MapPartitionsRDD.scala:52)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the task might be rescheduled on a different executor but as the block is registered to the first block manager the error will be the same:\r\n```\r\njava.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 00000000\r\n  at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readStreamHeader(ObjectInputStream.java:943)\r\n  at java.io.ObjectInputStream.<init>(ObjectInputStream.java:401)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaDeserializationStream$$anon$1.<init>(JavaSerializer.scala:63)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaDeserializationStream.<init>(JavaSerializer.scala:63)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializerInstance.deserializeStream(JavaSerializer.scala:122)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.serializer.SerializerManager.dataDeserializeStream(SerializerManager.scala:209)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager$$anonfun$getRemoteValues$1.apply(BlockManager.scala:698)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager$$anonfun$getRemoteValues$1.apply(BlockManager.scala:696)\r\n  at scala.Option.map(Option.scala:146)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.getRemoteValues(BlockManager.scala:696)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.get(BlockManager.scala:831)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.getOrElseUpdate(BlockManager.scala:886)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.getOrCompute(RDD.scala:335)\r\n ``` \r\n \r\nMy idea deregistering the block when the IO operation occurs and let the following task to recompute it.\r\n\r\nThis PR only targets only local blocks. In a follow up PR `getRemoteValues` can be extended with the block removing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1) An existing unit test was extended.\r\n2) Manually.\r\n\r\n#### Manual testing\r\n\r\nStart Spark:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell --master \"local-cluster[3,1,1200]\" --conf spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializer\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a persisted RDD (here via a DF):\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = sc.parallelize(1 to 20, 4).toDF\r\n...\r\nscala> df.persist(org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)\r\n...\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|    1|\r\n|    2|\r\n|    3|\r\n|    4|\r\n|    5|\r\n|    6|\r\n|    7|\r\n|    8|\r\n|    9|\r\n|   10|\r\n|   11|\r\n|   12|\r\n|   13|\r\n|   14|\r\n|   15|\r\n|   16|\r\n|   17|\r\n|   18|\r\n|   19|\r\n|   20|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow as the blocks are persisted let's corrupt one of the file. For this we have to find the the directory where the blocks stored:\r\n```\r\n$ grep \"DiskBlockManager: Created local directory\" work/app-20220511112820-0000/*/stdout\r\nwork/app-20220511112820-0000/0/stdout:22/05/11 11:28:21 INFO DiskBlockManager: Created local directory at /private/var/folders/s4/qrgp74ds36l9t56tx_f6w54h0000gn/T/spark-df93a007-256e-4c16-ad23-ff7eae76c850/executor-0f4c0d32-8f12-447f-add3-5cfbd4a7c777/blockmgr-dde20b67-a824-4d92-9023-8fa902588a26\r\nwork/app-20220511112820-0000/1/stdout:22/05/11 11:28:21 INFO DiskBlockManager: Created local directory at /private/var/folders/s4/qrgp74ds36l9t56tx_f6w54h0000gn/T/spark-df93a007-256e-4c16-ad23-ff7eae76c850/executor-05de3de7-60ca-4954-8baa-965da3c35ce5/blockmgr-71c559a6-f0e8-42a1-bf53-3bddb4a69618\r\nwork/app-20220511112820-0000/2/stdout:22/05/11 11:28:21 INFO DiskBlockManager: Created local directory at /private/var/folders/s4/qrgp74ds36l9t56tx_f6w54h0000gn/T/spark-df93a007-256e-4c16-ad23-ff7eae76c850/executor-bf0ca6de-17c6-437f-82e9-33afb01dce7d/blockmgr-1f66ae2a-0a3a-4a99-8f75-b65b5d4e5e0c\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's write something into one of the rdd file:\r\n```\r\nvim /private/var/folders/s4/qrgp74ds36l9t56tx_f6w54h0000gn/T/spark-df93a007-256e-4c16-ad23-ff7eae76c850/executor-bf0ca6de-17c6-437f-82e9-33afb01dce7d/blockmgr-1f66ae2a-0a3a-4a99-8f75-b65b5d4e5e0c/19/rdd_4_1\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the DF/RDD one more time:\r\n```\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n22/05/11 11:30:41 WARN TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 7) (192.168.1.65 executor 2): java.io.StreamCorruptedException: invalid stream header: 41ACED00\r\n        at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readStreamHeader(ObjectInputStream.java:938)\r\n        at java.io.ObjectInputStream.<init>(ObjectInputStream.java:396)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaDeserializationStream$$anon$1.<init>(JavaSerializer.scala:66)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaDeserializationStream.<init>(JavaSerializer.scala:66)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.serializer.JavaSerializerInstance.deserializeStream(JavaSerializer.scala:137)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.serializer.SerializerManager.dataDeserializeStream(SerializerManager.scala:212)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.getLocalValues(BlockManager.scala:967)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.get(BlockManager.scala:1277)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager.getOrElseUpdate(BlockManager.scala:1344)\r\n ...\r\n         at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.tryWithSafeFinally(Utils.scala:1504)\r\n        at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:551)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n        at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:750)\r\n\r\n+-----+\r\n|value|\r\n+-----+\r\n|    1|\r\n|    2|\r\n|    3|\r\n|    4|\r\n|    5|\r\n|    6|\r\n|    7|\r\n|    8|\r\n|    9|\r\n|   10|\r\n|   11|\r\n|   12|\r\n|   13|\r\n|   14|\r\n|   15|\r\n|   16|\r\n|   17|\r\n|   18|\r\n|   19|\r\n|   20|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the logs:\r\n```\r\n$ cat work/app-20220511112820-0000/2/stdout\r\n...\r\n22/05/11 11:30:41 INFO CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend: Got assigned task 7\r\n22/05/11 11:30:41 INFO Executor: Running task 0.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 7)\r\n...\r\n22/05/11 11:30:41 INFO BlockManager: invalid stream header: 41ACED00.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen a task fails, users are more concerned about the causes of failed tasks and failed tasks. The Current Spark UI and History are sorted according to \"Index\" rather than \"Errors\". When a large number of tasks are sorted, you need to wait a certain period for tasks to be sorted. In order to find the cause of Errors for failed tasks, we can improve the user experience by specifying sorting by the \"Errors\" column at the beginning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid sorting time for tasks because the user's primary purpose is to view the logs of failed tasks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno change by default\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-11T18:59:47Z","updated_at":"2022-05-24T15:23:30Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T09:21:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"536a4051332fc8005895cd47343eba01581e77e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

This PR fixes this check. Now \"extract-only\" means: the attribute only appears as a child of `ExtractValue`, but the consumer expression can be in any shape.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark was able to read complex unions already but not write them. \r\nNow it is possible to also write them.  If you have a schema with a complex union the following code is now working:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark\r\n  .read.format(\"avro\").option(\"avroSchema\", avroSchema).load(path)\r\n  .write.format(\"avro\").option(\"avroSchema\", avroSchema).save(\"/tmp/b\")\r\n```\r\nWhile before this patch it would throw `Unsupported Avro UNION type` when writing.\r\n\r\nAdd the capability to write complex unions, next to reading them.\r\nComplex unions map to struct types where field names are member0, member1, etc.\r\nThis is consistent with the behavior in SchemaConverters for reading them\r\nand when converting between Avro and Parquet.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes SPARK-25050, lines up read and write compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe behaviour improved of course, this is as far as I could see not impacting any customer facing API's or documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added extra unit tests.\r\n- Updated existing unit tests for improved behaviour.\r\n- Validated manually with an internal corpus of avro files if they now could be read and written without problems.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR seeks to allow exists (but also NOT exists, IN, and NOT IN) to be rewritten as the appropriate join by `RewritePredicateSubquery` before `InferFiltersFromConstraints` runs. This allows the join conditions to infer filters, such as null filtering that can be pushed down to the scan.\r\n\r\nThis particular example came about when executing a query derived from TPCDS q16 where we see an exists that is converted into a LeftSemi, but null filtering or push down filters don't exist, forcing Spark to load many null key rows that will not match (more details in the jira issue, with plans and a simpler repro case).\r\n\r\nI am particularly weary of making changes in the optimizer as rules depend on the order and build on each other.\r\n\r\nI copied (but believe I should move) `RewritePredicateSubquery` ahead of `InferFiltersFromConstraints`, which has the desired effect in my particular test case. I did not bring the whole `RewriteSubquery` batch with it, and that's my first question. Should all of [RewriteSubquery](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/Optimizer.scala#L237) move further up?\r\n\r\nWith the new join and filter (and push down) added earlier now, does anyone know if this could cause conflicts with rules that come after? I've spent some time reading through each of the rules and I am not convinced that a push down rule, or join reorder isn't going to be affected. \r\n\r\nAny feedback would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, LeftSemi/LeftAnti inserted because of (NOT) exists or (NOT) in, will not get null key filtering or push down benefits.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is going to make some queries run faster.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manual execution of a query based on TPCDS q16\r\n- Unit test was added to assert that the FilterExec is added. I am happy to add more tests.","created_at":"2022-05-11T04:32:55Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T00:30:56Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T00:30:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9020b7247660abedb54d30bdedea95614e4a13ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36036690a795f886f744f957893e7340b71358ef","head":{"label":"abellina:SPARK-39131","ref":"SPARK-39131","sha":"36036690a795f886f744f957893e7340b71358ef","user":{"login":"abellina","id":1901059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDEwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina","html_url":"https://github.com/abellina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143883563,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM4ODM1NjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"abellina/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abellina","id":1901059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDEwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina","html_url":"https://github.com/abellina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abellina/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen we have nested subquery expressions, there is a chance that deduplicate relations could replace an attributes with a wrong one. This is because the attributes replacement is done by top down than bottom up. This could happen if the subplan gets deduplicate relations first (thus two same relation with different attributes id), then a more complex plan built on top of the subplan (e.g. a UNION of queries with nested subquery expressions) can trigger this wrong attribute replacement error.\r\n\r\nFor concrete example please see the added unit test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is bug that we can fix. Without this PR, we could hit that outer attribute reference does not exist in the outer relation at certain scenario. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch `java.lang.IllegalStateException` and `java.lang.AssertionError` (raised by asserts), and wrap them by Spark's exception w/ the `INTERNAL_ERROR` error class. The modification affects only actions so far.\r\n\r\nThis PR affects the case of missing bucket file. After the changes, Spark throws `SparkException` w/ `INTERNAL_ERROR` instead of `IllegalStateException`. Since this is not Spark's illegal state, the exception should be replaced by another runtime exception. Created the ticket SPARK-39163 to fix this.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL and unify representation of internal errors by using error classes like for other errors. Usually, users shouldn't observe asserts and illegal states, but even if such situation happens, they should see errors in the same way as other errors (w/ error class `INTERNAL_ERROR`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. At least, in one particular case, see the modified test suites and SPARK-39163.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.BucketedReadWithoutHiveSupportSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.AdaptiveQueryExecSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.WholeStageCodegenSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-05-10T16:47:21Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T20:54:26Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T20:54:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc9f1885df95330e4b749ac2a19936b222807136","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36500/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36500/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36500/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c6a6478d1fcf0f10366e9ff39b074fac39e0a36","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:class-internal-error","ref":"class-internal-error","sha":"0c6a6478d1fcf0f10366e9ff39b074fac39e0a36","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n - Implemented getCatalystType method in TeradataDialect\r\n - Handle Types.NUMERIC explicitly\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLoad table from Teradata, if the type of column in Teradata is `Number`, it will be converted to `DecimalType(38,0)` which will lose the fractional part of original data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it will convert Number type to DecimalType(38,18) if the scale is 0, so that keep the fractional part in some way.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT is added to JDBCSuite.scala.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-10T16:14:39Z","updated_at":"2022-06-20T23:10:51Z","closed_at":"2022-06-20T23:10:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44fe2dcd261ec1ca992d83f3ca1932722c21ed50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9a41cca183b5ce1847bc46bbd6112d1c761722e","head":{"label":"Eugene-Mark:teradata-loading","ref":"teradata-loading","sha":"d9a41cca183b5ce1847bc46bbd6112d1c761722e","user":{"login":"Eugene-Mark","id":51333308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzMzMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51333308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark","html_url":"https://github.com/Eugene-Mark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":485454301,"node_id":"R_kgDOHO9x3Q","name":"spark","full_name":"Eugene-Mark/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Eugene-Mark","id":51333308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzMzMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51333308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark","html_url":"https://github.com/Eugene-Mark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eugene-Mark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Eugene-Mark/spark","description":"Apache

The intention was to avoid putting the LOCATION clause for managed tables in `ShowCreateTableExec`. However, if we use the v2 DESCRIBE TABLE command by default in the future, this will bring a behavior change and v2 DESCRIBE TABLE command won't print the table location for managed tables.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this regression by using a different idea to fix the SHOW CREATE TABLE issue:\r\n1. introduce a new reserved table property `is_managed_location`, to indicate that the location is managed by the catalog, not user given.\r\n2. `ShowCreateTableExec` only generates the LOCATION clause if the \"location\" property is present and is not managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis proposes to add a custom metric of skipped null values for stream-stream join operator.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `STATE_STORE_SKIP_NULLS_FOR_STREAM_STREAM_JOINS` is enabled, Spark will skip null values in hash-based stream-stream joins. But currently we cannot track if this is happened and how many it is. For our customers, they have an interest to know the number of values skipped for better tracking purpose.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. One custom metric is added to stream-stream join if the config is enabled. As the config is disabled by default, it is 'no' for users by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated current test.","created_at":"2022-05-10T02:30:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:26:21Z","closed_at":"2022-05-10T23:51:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbbbd0df4a7cf749b2d14bd5f5d6043c15daa331","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `iteratorTracker` in `RockDB` holds `LevelDBIterator` WeakReference  but not strong eference, so it doesn't hold all unclosed `LevelDBIterator` due to JVM GC, some `LevelDBIterator` will be held by the JVM `Finalizer` thread. We cannot interfere with the running state of `Finalizer`, so there is no guarantee that all not closed `LevelDBIterator` in `Finalizer` have been closed before `LevelDB.close()` is executed. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the thread executing `LevelDB.close()` and `Finalizer` thread need the same lock, so if `LevelDB.close()` executes first, pending `db.closeIterator(this)` in `Finalizer` can only wait.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the current mechanism cannot guarantee that all `LevelDBIterator`s are closed before the `LevelDB` is closed.\r\n\r\nThis pr try to use a custom `ReferenceQueue + cleanupThread` instead of `Finalization` mechanism to automatically clean up `LevelDBIterator` resources that are not explicitly closed in Spark code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix potential risk  `LevelDBIterator` resource leak and ensure all `LevelDBIterator`s are closed before the `LevelDB` is closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA and add a new test to check all LevelDBIterator not explicit closed\r\n- test `org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.LevelDBBenchmark`\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\n                                          count mean  min max 95th\r\ndbClose                                   4 0.135

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPropagateEmptyRelation can simplify Join. For example, if the right side of LEFT JOIN is empty, then it can eliminate join to its left side.\r\n\r\nIf there is a shuffle on the left side, it can be considered that the shuffle is meaningless, and the shuffle can be optimized by using LocalRead.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM testData LEFT JOIN testData2 ON key = a and a > 10\r\n```\r\nBefore this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the Period test to use months rather than days.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhile the Period test as-is confirms that the compilation error is fixed, it doesn't confirm that the newly generated code is correct. Spark ignores any unit less than months in Periods. As a result, we are always testing `0/(num + 3)`, so the test doesn't verify that the code generated for the right-hand operand is correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, only changes a test.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRespect table capability ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA in DEFAULT column resolution by leaving such tables unchanged by any DEFAULT column resolution logic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTables with ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA capability declare themselves to accept inserted rows of any schema, so we should not add extra columns to INSERT VALUES lists or projections corresponding to any DEFAULT columns in the target table schema.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces new unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix test failure in build.\r\nDepending on the umask of the process running tests (which is typically inherited from the user's default umask), the group writable bit for the files/directories could be set or unset. The test was assuming that by default the umask will be restrictive (and so files/directories wont be group writable). Since this is not a valid assumption, we use jnr to change the umask of the process to be more restrictive - so that the test can validate the behavior change - and reset it back once the test is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix test failure in build\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nAdds jnr as a test scoped dependency, which does not bring in any other new dependency (asm is already a dep in spark).\r\n```\r\n[INFO] +- com.github.jnr:jnr-posix:jar:3.0.9:test\r\n[INFO] |  +- com.github.jnr:jnr-ffi:jar:2.0.1:test\r\n[INFO]

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`sql-expression-schema.md` is a golden file for tracking purposes: whenever we change a function or add a new function, this file must be updated. However, the number of functions in this file is not very useful and stops people from adding functions at the same time. This PR prints the summary information during test instead of putting it in the golden file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIncrease development velocity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- add try-catch when we fold children inside `ConditionalExpression` if it's not foldable\r\n- mark `CaseWhen` and `If` as foldable if it's children are foldable\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor a conditional expression, we should add a try-catch to partially fold the constant inside it's children because some bracnhes may no be evaluated at runtime. For example if c1 or c2 is not null, the last branch should be never hit:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COALESCE(c1, c2, 1/0);\r\n```\r\nBesides, for CaseWhen and If, we should mark it as foldable if it's children are foldable. It is safe since the both non-codegen and codegen code path have already respected the evaluation order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd more test in sql

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `iteratorTracker` in `RockDB` holds `RocksDBIterator` WeakReference  but not strong reference, so it doesn't hold all unclosed `RocksDBIterator` due to JVM GC, some `RocksDBIterator` will be held by the JVM `Finalizer` thread. We cannot interfere with the running state of Finalizer, so there is no guarantee that all not closed `RocksDBIterator`s in `Finalizer` have been closed before `RocksDB.close()` is executed. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the thread executing `RocksDB.close()` and `Finalizer` thread need the same lock, so if `RocksDB.close()` executes first, pending `db.closeIterator(this)` in `Finalizer` can only wait.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the current mechanism cannot guarantee that all `RocksDBIterator`s are closed before the `RocksDB` is closed.\r\n\r\nIf user use a `rocksdbjni` compile with `DEBUG_LEVEL=1` to enables all assertions of `rocksdbjni`(official `rocksdbjni` compile with `DEBUG_LEVEL=0` and diabled all assertions), above issue will lead to JVM crash. \r\n\r\nSo this pr try to use a custom `ReferenceQueue + cleanupThread` instead of `Finalization` mechanism to automatically clean up `RocksDBIterator` resources that are not explicitly closed in Spark code and solve the issue mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix potential risk of JVM crash and `RocksDBIterator` resource leak, ensure all `RocksDBIterator`s are closed before the `RocksDB` is closed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA and add a new test to check all RocksDBIterator not explicit closed\r\n- Manual test：\r\n\r\n1. Compile a rocksdbjni with `DEBUG_LEVEL=1` ref to https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksJava-Basics and modify `pom.xml` as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.rocksdb</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>rocksdbjni</artifactId>\r\n  <version>7.1.2</version>\r\n  <scope>system</scope>\r\n  <systemPath>/${basepath}/rocksdb/java/target/rocksdbjni-7.1.2-osx.jar</systemPath>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n2. Run test cases `testCloseRocksDBIterator` and `testAllRocksDBIteratorNotExplicitClosed` in `kvstore.RocksDBSuite`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests -pl common/kvstore -am \r\nmvn test  -pl common/kvstore -Dtest=org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.RocksDBSuite#testCloseRocksDBIterator\r\nmvn test  -pl common/kvstore -Dtest=org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.RocksDBSuite#testAllRocksDBIteratorNotExplicitClosed\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\nAll UTs lead JVM crash as follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Error occurred in starting fork, check output in log\r\n[ERROR] Process Exit Code: 134\r\n[ERROR] Crashed tests:\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.spark.util.kvstore.RocksDBSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey error message as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssertion failed: (last_ref), function ~ColumnFamilySet, file db/column_family.cc, line 1494.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\nAll test passed\r\n\r\n- test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd groupby positional indexing support for Pandas on Spark.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPandas supports Groupby positional indexing since v1.4.0\r\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.4.0.html#groupby-positional-indexing\r\n\r\nBefore 1.4.0, `pdf.groupby(\"a\").head(-2) == pdf.groupby(\"a\").head(0)` return empty dataframe, after 1.4.0, it allows to specify positional ranges relative to the ends of each group.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[\"g\", \"g0\"], [\"g\", \"g1\"], [\"g\", \"g2\"], [\"g\", \"g3\"], [\"h\", \"h0\"], [\"h\", \"h1\"]], columns=[\"A\", \"B\"])\r\ndf.groupby(\"A\").head(-1)\r\n\r\n   A   B\r\n0  g  g0\r\n1  g  g1\r\n2  g  g2\r\n4  h  h0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, follow pandas 1.4+ behaviors, still keep the behavor when using pandas < 1.4\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added some more postional indexing test (-1, -100000).\r\n- `test_tail` and `test_head` pass with pandas 1.3.x and 1.4.x","created_at":"2022-05-06T07:02:40Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T10:02:48Z","closed_at":"2022-05-19T10:02:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"864ddc10396f62fe6370c753268b6de5442037f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36464/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36464/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36464/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49ae707703253035adf84975e085e1d783802720","head":{"label":"Yikun:SPARK-38947","ref":"SPARK-38947","sha":"49ae707703253035adf84975e085e1d783802720","user":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335541670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU1NDE2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Yikun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR marks overridden methods with `@Override` annotation. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAn overridden method from an interface or abstract class must be marked with `@Override` annotation. To accurately determine whether the overriding is successful, an `@Override` annotation is necessary. Meanwhile, once the method signature in the abstract class is changed, the implementation class will report a compile-time error immediately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen trying to perform a regex replace, account for the possibility of having empty strings as input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29891 was merged to address https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30796 and introduced a bug that would not allow regex matching on empty strings, as it would account for position within substring but not consider the case where input string has length 0 (empty string)\r\n\r\nFrom https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39107 there is a change in behavior between spark versions.\r\n3.0.2\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = spark.sql(\"SELECT '' AS col\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [col: string]\r\n\r\nscala> df.withColumn(\"replaced\", regexp_replace(col(\"col\"), \"^$\", \"<empty>\")).show\r\n+---+--------+\r\n|col|replaced|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n|   | <empty>|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n```\r\n3.1.2\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = spark.sql(\"SELECT '' AS col\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [col: string]\r\n\r\nscala> df.withColumn(\"replaced\", regexp_replace(col(\"col\"), \"^$\", \"<empty>\")).show\r\n+---+--------+\r\n|col|replaced|\r\n+---+--------+\r\n|   |        |\r\n+---+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe 3.0.2 outcome is the expected and correct one\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes compared to spark 3.2.1, as it brings back the correct behavior when trying to regex match empty strings, as shown in the example above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded special casing test in `RegexpExpressionsSuite.RegexReplace` with empty string

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd `ConditionalExpression` trait.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor developers, if a custom conditional like expression contains common sub expression then the evaluation order may be changed since Spark will pull out and eval the common sub expressions first during execution.\r\n\r\nAdd ConditionalExpression trait is friendly for developers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, add a new trait\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR is proposed to\r\n- Implement `numeric_only` of `SeriesGroupBy.mean` and `DataFrameGroupBy.mean`\r\n- Adjust `SeriesGroupBy.mean/median` to match pandas 1.4\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove API compatibility with pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `GroupBy.mean/median` behaves the same as pandas 1.4's.\r\n\r\nTake `GroupBy.mean` as an example:\r\n- DataFrameGroupBy.mean\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 1, 2],\"B\": [3.1, 4.1, 4.1, 3.1],\"C\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"b\", \"a\"],\"D\": [True, False, False, True]})\r\n>>> psdf\r\n   A    B  C      D\r\n0  1  3.1  a   True\r\n1  2  4.1  b  False\r\n2  1  4.1  b  False\r\n3  2  3.1  a   True\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.groupby('A').mean(numeric_only=False)\r\n...: FutureWarning: Dropping invalid columns in GroupBy.mean is deprecated. In a future version, a TypeError will be raised. Before calling .mean, select only columns which should be valid for the function.\r\n  warnings.warn(\r\n     B    D\r\nA          \r\n1  3.6  0.5\r\n2  3.6  0.5\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.groupby('A').mean(numeric_only=None)\r\n...: FutureWarning: Dropping invalid columns in GroupBy.mean is deprecated. In a future version, a TypeError will be raised. Before calling .mean, select only columns which should be valid for the function.\r\n  warnings.warn(\r\n     B    D\r\nA          \r\n1  3.6  0.5\r\n2  3.6  0.5\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.groupby('A').mean(numeric_only=True)\r\n     B    D\r\nA          \r\n1  3.6  0.5\r\n2  3.6  0.5\r\n\r\n# Not raise the FutureWarning when there is no non-numeric aggregation column\r\n>>> psdf[['A', 'B', 'D']].groupby('A').mean(numeric_only=False)\r\n     B    D                                                                     \r\nA          \r\n1  3.6  0.5\r\n2  3.6  0.5\r\n```\r\n- SeriesGroupBy.mean\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf.groupby(\"A\")[\"C\"].mean()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Only numeric aggregation column is accepted.\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-05T00:32:22Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T00:05:02Z","closed_at":"2022-05-11T00:05:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"330d9c8b8b1ceb3e5797796ccf626adef3e58e61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36452/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36452/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36452/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95ac111a6825ea680f88146849cafc7ff0eeb5df","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:groupby.numeric_only","ref":"groupby.numeric_only","sha":"95ac111a6825ea680f88146849cafc7ff0eeb5df","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache
