What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR is to address so called `offline view` (view only + offline) mode. In this mode you open notebook in `only view` mode meaning can't do any editions + notebook and paragraph bars are disabled. Further, it's called `offline`, in case someone else does any changes in the notebook while you have it open, the changes will not be rendered in your screen until you reload it. There was initial work under #389, however some notable differences exist. For example, same functionality here available from frontend menu without need to restart Zeppelin. Also it provides `offline` view which was absent in initial PR.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - basic frontend implementation\n- [ ] - address comments + green CI\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nrelated to [ZEPPELIN-385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-385)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. open any notebook\n2. click `offline view` from the dropdown menu of notebook `looknfeel` bar on the  top right\n3. try to edit note or do any changes\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nview only\n![offlineview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1642088/16442880/489470f8-3d8a-11e6-9edb-4677230a6a44.gif)\n\noffline view\n![offline4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1642088/16543563/f5ae83a4-4114-11e6-9ada-80afef7666e8.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nIf a user has \"org.apache.phoenix:phoenix-core:4.x.x\" jar added as a dependency in JDBC interpreter, and for some reason phoenix was not accessible or not properly configured; then the phoenix tries to for 35 times (which is default for hbase.client.retries.number) and each retires is 8 second apart, before it finally fails.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### Todos\n- [x] - Set phoenix.hbase.client.retries.number for JDBC\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1076](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1076)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIn JDBC interpreter add `org.apache.phoenix:phoenix-core:4.4.0-HBase-1.0` as dependency, but don't configure phoenix setting.\nThen try to run any sql query with any of the configured JDBC driver (like `show tables`)\n- Without this it will take slightly more than about 5 mins\n- With this it should fetch result sooner (in less than a minute)\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? n/a\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? n/a\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nSometimes extra space is present as part of username in search box while trying to setup Zeppelin permissions\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### Todos\n- [x] - trim string and then add user\n- [x] - implement searching in Active Directory\n- [x] - improve order by search result\n- [x] - implement debounce to reduce server request\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- [ZEPPELIN-1042](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1042)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nZeppelin is configured with LDAP authentication.\nHere is the scenario\n1. Login as 'user1' user and create a notebook ('Untitled Note 1')\n2. Try to change the permission of 'Untitled Note 1'. Start typing in owners box -> user1\n3. The search box appears with a saved name ' user1' (There is an extra space in front of user1')\n4. Then click on the search box item and save the permissions. The permissions that get saved have all got an extra space before the username 'user1' though it is not intended to have that space.\n5.

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR is fixing the bug by implementing a new layout for the Notebook Dropdown menu.\nReason being that setting a maximum height and having a scrollbar doesn't mix with having bootstrap submenus.\n\nIn term of dropdown layout, I think we have 2 options:\n- The one I implemented, a tree view similar to the one in the home page, I can probably uniform both of them later. One possible problem is the dropdown width getting bigger and bigger as we indent at each submenu.\n- The second one would not have any indent, but use a background color to show elements in the same folder (A grey that goes clearer as we go in the submenus)\n\n<img width=\"691\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-25 at 1 42 41 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/710411/16344155/2d387af0-3a76-11e6-87ba-9626d9f17fea.png\">\n\nReworking the whole notebook list and dropdown will probably need a lot more work later (especially in term of refactoring and code cleaning), so I'm not sure where the scope of this PR should stop, especially with the release coming.

Since in step-3 owners = admin ; it allows me to save these changes successfully\n5) Now I again try to toggle permissions of the notebook.

What is this PR for?\n\nFor next release I would like to do simple additions to my proxy setup on main README:\n- Add Maven proxy configuration example.\n- Add note on Bower main repository (just for zeppelin-web module) [1].\n\n[1] Currently, there is no way to reach Bower main repository through NTLM proxy (no matter what you put in your .bowerrc). The problem is `Request failed with ECONNRESET`. Let me know if someone can build zeppelin-web behind NTLM proxy .\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nDocumentation\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nZEPPELIN-281 (closed)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nNo tests, just check README, proxy settings paragraph.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T21:05:05Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T08:43:07Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T16:38:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71a7e02b24b9067a489dcd2a1d8ae495aabaa42b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/065e3f399ad39e315560f676ba8d570eab106627","head":{"label":"fvaleri:windows7-build2","ref":"windows7-build2","sha":"065e3f399ad39e315560f676ba8d570eab106627","user":{"login":"fvaleri","id":11456498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDU2NDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11456498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri","html_url":"https://github.com/fvaleri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ab5ce6256f15ce70ef165a62d21fda0c677e96d9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently, when a user who doesn't have a permission for a notebook is trying to access to the notebook, a dialog is shown up. The user can login in this dialog or close it.\nBut if the user is trying to just close this dialog, the location is not changed and still stay `/notebook/NOTE_ID` with blank page. So the user have to click somewhere manually. \n\nSo I just added `$window.history.back()` so that it can go back to previous page.\nSee the attached gif image :)\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### Todos\n- [x] - Disable backdrop, ESC drop and close icon\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1043](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1043)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Apply this patch and activate shiro -> login with `admin`\n2. Create a notebook and set a note permission (just fill  all 3 fields with `admin`)\n3. Logout with `admin` and login with `user1` \n4. Try to access to the notebook -> a popup will be shown\n5. Click `Cancel` -> Page will redirect to your previous location (home or the previous notebook page)\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- Before\n  ![before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16245851/96bd5674-37b7-11e6-9f9e-c69b74b0e6cc.gif)\n- After\n  When you were in home\n  ![after1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16245854/9a16fc30-37b7-11e6-80d3-b7bae18c78b2.gif)\n  When you were in the other notebook \n  ![after2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16245855/9c0da7a0-37b7-11e6-8e07-470be0d18fa2.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nShiro web test is included as an element of Selenium web test.\nHowever, Shiro test case is to restart the zeppelin server.\nAs a result, the Selenium test does not work properly.\n- Shiro modified to proceed to the last test.\n\n``` java\npublic class AuthenticationIT extends AbstractZeppelinIT {\n  @BeforeClass\n  public static void startUp() {\n    if

(AuthenticationIT.java -> ZeppelinShiroAuthenticationIT.java) -fixed last test\n### How should this be tested?\n\nthis is a travis result issue.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-06-20T05:43:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T04:32:20Z","closed_at":"2016-06-29T04:32:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"877354b8235ff0930898af0f2afa98d30f0b3104","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/95d1ee2f45248e18dd19c359802f469e828e82fa","head":{"label":"cloverhearts:cifail/selenium-testfailed-via-auth","ref":"cifail/selenium-testfailed-via-auth","sha":"95d1ee2f45248e18dd19c359802f469e828e82fa","user":{"login":"cloverhearts","id":10525473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1NDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10525473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts","html_url":"https://github.com/cloverhearts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloverhearts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"8085ab678e3404a7e8de594f85a1c2b3c11defb8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\n\nI added auto TOC(Table of Contents) generator for Zeppelin documentation website. TOC can help people looking through whole contents at a glance and finding what they want quickly. \n\nI just added `<div id=\"toc\"></div>`  to the each documentation header. [`toc`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-1018?expand=1#diff-85af09fb498a5667ea455391533f945dR3)  recognize `<h2>` & `<h3>` as a title in the docs  and it automatically generate TOC. So I set a rule for this work. (I'll write this rule on `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` or [docs/howtocontributewebsite](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/development/howtocontributewebsite.html)). \n\n```\n# Level-1 Heading  <- Use only for the main title of the page\n## Level-2 Heading <- Start with this one\n### Level-3 heading <- Only use this one for child of Level-2\n\ntoc only recognize Level-2 & Level-3\n```\n\nPlease see the below attached screenshot image.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement & Documentation\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add TOC generator\n- [x] - Apply TOC(`<div id=\"toc\"></div>`) to every documentation and reorganize each headers(apply the above rule)\n- [x] - Fix some broken code block in several docs\n- [x] - Apply TOC to `r.md` (Currently R docs has some duplicated info since [this one](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/commit/d5e87fb8ba98f08db5b0a4995104ce19f182c678) and [this one](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/commit/7d6cc7e99154e2d337c11fdf8be1a874ed3e9ada) )\n- [x] - Apply TOC to `install.md` after #1010 merged\n- [x] - Apply TOC to `interpreterinstallation.md` after #1042 merged\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1018](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1018)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Apply this patch and build `docs/` with [this guide](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation)\n2.  Visit some docs page. Then you can see TOC in the header of page. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- Automatically generated TOC in Spark interpreter docs page\n  <img width=\"831\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-16 at 9 37 18 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16140902/945b9c7a-340a-11e6-91f3-b6174738bed0.png\">\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? \n  No. Actually I used [jekyll-table-of-contents#copyright](https://github.com/ghiculescu/jekyll-table-of-contents#copyright). But I don't need to add a license for this :)\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

[x] - Fix\n- [x] - Unittest\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1015\n### How should this be tested?\n\nCreate two paragraphs in the notebook\nFirst takes longer than second (last) paragraph.\nFirst paragraph and second paragraph should use different interpreter.\n\nIf cron schedule the notebook with 'auto-restart interpreter on cron execution' checked.\nThen interpreters will be restarted when second paragraph finished, but first paragraph is still running.\nThat may cause abort of first paragraph run.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T00:33:58Z","updated_at":"2016-06-18T17:16:29Z","closed_at":"2016-06-18T17:16:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89a50c66dc3cc3805ac613664be2bd23f5b46415","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/ccee60a74913dc51eb3a64f633b4c0e0449276b0","head":{"label":"Leemoonsoo:ZEPPELIN-1015","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1015","sha":"ccee60a74913dc51eb3a64f633b4c0e0449276b0","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32886931,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4NjkzMQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nMost of other projects have **Quick Start** or **Getting Started** page for the beginner. Currently, Zeppelin also has [Zeppelin Install](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.6.0-SNAPSHOT/install/install.html) which is similar with those kind of instruction page. But it has only contents that explain just installation and configuration. So I updated this page to **Quick Start** so that it can include step by step guide for the beginners.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement & Documentation \n### Todos\n- [x] - Add each title link to the head of documentation \n- [x] - Add more information about Zeppelin installation\n- [x] - Reorder contents \n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-998](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-998)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nSee the attached screenshot images\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n<img width=\"809\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-14 at 2 59 47 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16061227/d88abe56-3240-11e6-845c-e37a9975aceb.png\">\n<img width=\"796\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-14 at 3 00 01 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16061229/daca8b06-3240-11e6-821b-7d118b7b3e09.png\">\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-14 at 3 00 15 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16061234/dd12072c-3240-11e6-9a0a-cf1e320fd879.png\">\n<img width=\"785\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-14 at 3 00 27 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16061238/df7f904c-3240-11e6-83e0-73f3688c0815.png\">\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-06-14 at 3 00 38 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/16061242/e1ad1402-3240-11e6-81ba-2e7125cec98e.png\">\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?
