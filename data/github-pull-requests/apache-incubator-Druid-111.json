with current autoscaling : \n1. when lots of tasks are getting started, SimpleResourceManagementStrategy can wait too long to provision new nodes as it provisions 1 node at a time and then waits for that node to come online before starting another. \n2. SimpleResourceManagementStrategy maintains a targetWorkerCount based on the number of current  running tasks. During an indexing service upgrade an entire copy of the RT cluster is made. This copy remains mostly idle for the first hour (or few hours) while tasks slowly get launched on it. This causes reluctance to do anything risky with real time nodes as upgrades become very expensive\n\nThis PR adds PendingTaskBasedAutoscalingStrategy as an attempt to resolve above two issues. \nPendingTaskBasedAutoscalingStrategy takes into account the state of pending tasks, available capacity on existing nodes and the task assignment strategy to determine how many nodes to scale to.\nDuring an upgrade, only minWorkerNodes (instead of duplicating complete cluster) will be created as the service is updated and after that nodes are added as new tasks are added to the queue.  \n\nThe default resource management strategy is still be the old one which can be replaced by the new strategy once it gets tested well in production environments.

the function AbstractIndexerTest.unloadAndKillData(dataSource) removes segments for the specified data source, for hardcoded dates 2013-01-01 through 2013-12-01.  Originally, all of the integration tests used segments within that date range; that's no longer true. I had added a second flavor of unloadAndKillData() with additional parameters specifying a start and end date.  Himanshu suggested that it might be nicer to change unloadAndKillData() to delete every segment in a data source.  I've implemented that here.\n\nI could have changed the hardcoded dates to 1970-01-01 through some time in the far future, but I found that unappealing.  Instead, I gave CoordinatorResourceTestClient a function getSegmentDatesForDataSource (dataSource) to return a list of the segment dates for dataSource, and modified unloadAndKillData(dataSource) to sort that list and remove segments from the first date through the last.\n\nThough I'll be modifying existing tests (at Himanshu's request) to use the remove-all-segments function, I would like to leave the second flavor of unloadAndKillData present.  In future tests, we might have a reason to remove only a subset of data source segments (if only to test the removal functionality).\n","created_at":"2015-12-02T21:11:22Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:08Z","closed_at":"2015-12-09T19:12:14Z","merged_at":"2015-12-09T19:12:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"42d414e6926f332ed3304ee1f9b1662311542578","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/14","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/14","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/14/labels","id":1092727,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTA5MjcyNw==","number":14,"title":"0.9.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":393,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-01T16:53:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T00:30:50Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T00:30:50Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/ae4357dfabdb60367c45984a30c433cfae657066","head":{"label":"rasahner:intTestRmAllSegments","ref":"intTestRmAllSegments","sha":"ae4357dfabdb60367c45984a30c433cfae657066","user":{"login":"rasahner","id":3065997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3065997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner","html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34288228,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDI4ODIyOA==","name":"druid","full_name":"rasahner/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rasahner","id":3065997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjU5OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3065997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner","html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasahner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rasahner/druid","description":"Real²time

fixes #1970\n- extracted out segment handoff callbacks in SegmentHandoffNotifier\n  which is responsible for tracking segment handoffs and doing callbacks\n  when handoff is complete.\n- Coordinator now maintains a timeline for the segments which makes it faster to provide serverView for an interval\n- Added new end point to DatasourcesResource which exposes information about where nodes segments are loaded based on interval. \n- realtime index task  and realtime nodes now use HTTP end points exposed by the\n  coordinator to get serverView\n\nBelow image shows the improvements by above changes on zookeeper read load with nearly 500 realtime index tasks running - \n\n<img width=\"881\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-12-09 at 3 21 58 am\"

addresses issue #658 \n\nRelated to https://github.com/druid-io/druid-api/pull/68\n\nThis changes the RealtimePlumber and IndexGeneratorJob so that when an index is persisted, the next index created will inherit the dimension order built up by the previous index.\n\nThis is to better support arbitrary dimension orders when schema-less ingestion is used.\n\nWhen merging indexes, the index merger will now attempt to find the largest common dimension ordering across the indexes, e.g.:\n\nIndex 1 dims: DimA, DimB\nIndex 2 dims: DimC\nIndex 3 dims: DimC, DimA, DimB\n\nThe ordering that will be used will be DimC, DimA, DimB as that encompasses all of the shorter orderings.\n\nIf no common order is found, the merger will fall back to the original lexicographic dimension ordering.\n\nTo support this change, the persisted indexes now include null dimensions and the dimension encoding dictionaries will now always have an entry for the empty string. This is done so that previously seen dimensions are not dropped in case an index does not receive any events with values for that dimension.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n- Dimension order can be passed between the FireHydrants within a Sink, but not across Sinks.\n- Dimension orders can be passed between indexes within a single partition during batch ingestion, but not across partitions.\n","created_at":"2015-11-24T02:53:39Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:07Z","closed_at":"2016-01-19T23:20:15Z","merged_at":"2016-01-19T23:20:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"3bce294614be79a474fe01af8b160728e5ba249a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/14","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/14","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/14/labels","id":1092727,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTA5MjcyNw==","number":14,"title":"0.9.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"xvrl","id":815147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTE0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/815147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl","html_url":"https://github.com/xvrl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvrl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":393,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-05-01T16:53:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-20T00:30:50Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2016-05-20T00:30:50Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/747343e6212e0c8581e2f0ce7cd6a928fb2241e6","head":{"label":"jon-wei:inherit_dim_order","ref":"inherit_dim_order","sha":"747343e6212e0c8581e2f0ce7cd6a928fb2241e6","user":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41450391,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTQ1MDM5MQ==","name":"druid","full_name":"jon-wei/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei/druid","description":"Column

https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/1517\n\nIncompatible change:\nDeprecates `druid.coordinator.merge.on`. Instead, user will use `druid.coordinator.merge.strategy` for segment merging.\n\nIn this PR,\n `DruidCoordinatorHadoopSegmentMerger` will find small segments in the segment timeline, and submit HadoopIndexTask to reindex those imbalanced segments.\n\nFor example,\nHere is a timeline of segments for a specific dataSource (Note: The segment granularity for each segment could be arbitrary, there might also be a gap between two segments)\n\n```\nSegID:    1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12   13\nShard0: |_O_|_O_|_O_|_O_|_S_|_S_|_S_|_O_|_S_|_O_|_S_|_O_|_S_|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|\nShard1:         |_S_|                   |_S_|   |_S_|_S_|\nShard2:         |_S_|                   |_S_|   |_S_|\n\nS: the size of shard is below configured optimal size\nO: the size of shard >= configured optimal size\n```\n\nAs `DruidCoordinatorHadoopSegmentMerger` runs periodically, eventually there will be no shards in the timeline that are tagged with S.\n\nHere is the algorithm `DruidCoordinatorHadoopSegmentMerger` implements for finding imbalanced segments and submits the reindex task,\n\n```\nunbalancedIntervals = []\ncurrTotalSize = 0\nintervalToReindex = null\nshouldBeMerged = false  // whether we should reindex segments within intervalToReindex\n\n// the direction of scanning will alternate if we don't want to merge segments\n// that have gaps between them\nfor each segment \n\n  expand intervalToReindex with the interval of current segment\n\n  for each shard of current segment\n    if shard.getSize() < optimal size\n      shouldBeMerged = true // found a small segment\n    currTotalSize += shard.getSize()\n\n  // this is an estimate that whether we can get a good-size segment by\n  // reindexing the segments within intervalToReindex\n  if currTotalSize >= optimal size\n    if shouldBeMerged \n      unbalancedIntervals.add(intervalToReindex)\n    currTotalSize = 0\n    intervalToReindex = null\n    shouldBeMerged = false\n  else {\n    // do nothing. Since we don't have enough total size to make a segment \n    // with size >= optimal size, we'll seek to merge it with the next segment in the timeline\n  }\n\nif unbalancedIntervals is not empty:\n  submit HadoopIndexTask with unbalancedIntervals \n\nif we want to keep the segment gap during merge\n  invert the scan direction so that in next Coordinator's run, we will scan the segments in the inverted direction.\nNote: The reason we need to invert the scan direction when keepGap is enabled \nis because it's possible to have a small segment that is at the boundary of gap left over\n and never gets merged.\n\n```\n\nBasically, the algorithm iterates each segment in the timeline, and for each shard in that segment, we check if its size is below optimal size, if yes, we should definitely try to merge that shard with others. However, it's possible that the total size of shards in that segment is not big enough to make an optimal size segment, so we should seek to merge the current segment with the next one in the timeline.\nNote: If we want to keep the gap between segments that don't abut, it's possible to have small segments left over, however, we can invert the scan direction in the next Coordinator's run to eliminate those small segments.\n\n~~After #1728, #1768 are merged, `DruidCoordinatorHadoopSegmentMerger` should be able to get Aggregator information by sending SegmentMetadataQuery. Currently, users have to provide aggregation information through runtime properties.~~\n","created_at":"2015-11-20T21:42:58Z","updated_at":"2019-02-07T11:28:30Z","closed_at":"2019-02-07T11:28:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3340ab7973283a77be8419264dbf3f481df16ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

(similar to `hyperUniqueCardinality`)\n- removes creation of one theta sketch per event at ingestion time, this is about 3x faster\n\n@cheddar can you please review this one?

existing Iterable returned by IncrementalIndexAdapter.getRows() does not work correctly if it is walked more than once.\n\nThe \"count\" integer inside the transformation function never gets reset, so after iterating through the getRows() iterable once, the Rowboats that are returned have invalid rowNums.\n\nThe patch changes the behavior of getRows() so that a new Iterator is created each time iterator() is called on the returned Iterable; the transform function and its count variable are no longer shared across iterator() calls.\n# \n\nThis came up as I was stepping through testPersistMerge() from IndexMergerTest in a debugger, and makeIndexFiles from IndexMerger. \n\nWhen IndexMerger is merging rows:\nIterable<Rowboat> theRows = rowMergerFn.apply(boats);\n\nI looked at
