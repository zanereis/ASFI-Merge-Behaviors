Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4564\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- Azure polling errors before container is up fixed\r\n- Azure polling spam in log from TokenRequest fixed\r\n- Only 1 request to Azure per polling iteration (instead of 2)\r\n- Status indication if container fails provisioning\r\n- On-kill procedure (also for execution timeout)\r\n- Environmental variables can be secret/secure (azure)\r\n- Name of container has name-checking at construction time to avoid errors during execution.\r\n- Added GPU support\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- tests/contrib/operators/test_azure_container_instances_operator.py \r\n  - test_name_checker\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T21:30:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T16:23:03Z","closed_at":"2019-07-01T16:23:03Z","merged_at":"2019-07-01T16:23:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"722379adc7a51bfa19d08b74ce8f048c85aa6738","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ca2d1192860ad764cfae3807c3eef3c0f5739815","head":{"label":"Trollgeir:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca2d1192860ad764cfae3807c3eef3c0f5739815","user":{"login":"Trollgeir","id":7591857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTE4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7591857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir","html_url":"https://github.com/Trollgeir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176610151,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzY2MTAxNTE=","name":"airflow","full_name":"Trollgeir/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Trollgeir","id":7591857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTE4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7591857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir","html_url":"https://github.com/Trollgeir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trollgeir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Trollgeir/airflow","description":"Apache

It creates weird interaction assigning it to `method` parameter instead of `url` which raises `requests.exceptions.MissingSchema: Invalid URL 'None': No schema supplied`. Fixed making both explicit.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUses existing Operator tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-4089?filter=allopenissues) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR addresses the fact that pytz timezone objects do not have the attribute `name`. It does have a similar attribute `zone` that could be used though not with complete compatibility. For example, there are no `pendulum.tzinfo.name`s for `Africa/Casablanca, Africa/El_Aaiun` but there are for `pytz.tzinfo.zone`. I propose we just remove the mention of pytz compatibility from the docs instead of dealing with incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo test because just a documentation change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4479\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFixes bug where s3_overwrite kwarg was not being passed to S3Hook load_bytes method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExtends existing test to include kwargs\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-22T12:58:24Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T15:20:09Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T15:29:06Z","merged_at":"2019-06-21T15:29:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5c39f89df6cb4c9cb15f4434ef9d1f9c934d42f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0fe36a15ae67f538a6bbe4a7cbbba980b623b61f","head":{"label":"JCoder01:airflow_4479_imap_s3","ref":"airflow_4479_imap_s3","sha":"0fe36a15ae67f538a6bbe4a7cbbba980b623b61f","user":{"login":"JCoder01","id":651639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01","html_url":"https://github.com/JCoder01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":184792215,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODQ3OTIyMTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"JCoder01/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JCoder01","id":651639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/651639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01","html_url":"https://github.com/JCoder01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JCoder01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JCoder01/airflow","description":"Apache

Argument was present but not called.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadjusts existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nShell script tests for the `sudo` command and only uses it if present.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:  The bash script is untested.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`   (N/A - no python change)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-21T20:43:55Z","updated_at":"2019-05-23T21:45:17Z","closed_at":"2019-05-23T21:45:16Z","merged_at":"2019-05-23T21:45:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"4856353dc4cdb61bf0c914507a00bbf16ead91d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f3d8fc7b4670fa5b838944b8ec21c4a59c205f18","head":{"label":"dossett:unit_test_tweak","ref":"unit_test_tweak","sha":"f3d8fc7b4670fa5b838944b8ec21c4a59c205f18","user":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":153471524,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM0NzE1MjQ=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"dossett/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dossett","id":7207582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDc1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7207582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett","html_url":"https://github.com/dossett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dossett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dossett/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nInline code highlighting of `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/master` at https://airflow.apache.org/howto/connection/index.html are broken. So I fix it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-21T15:23:04Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T16:30:10Z","closed_at":"2019-05-21T16:30:10Z","merged_at":"2019-05-21T16:30:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8d837109f152d6d6a9eca509f72bce3ca0ccc08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9e4e2d28a78c1314468daa7c542cfa924e291e0f","head":{"label":"shibataka000:fix_wrong_inline_code_highlighting","ref":"fix_wrong_inline_code_highlighting","sha":"9e4e2d28a78c1314468daa7c542cfa924e291e0f","user":{"login":"shibataka000","id":1219666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1219666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000","html_url":"https://github.com/shibataka000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187328321,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODczMjgzMjE=","name":"airflow","full_name":"shibataka000/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shibataka000","id":1219666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1219666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000","html_url":"https://github.com/shibataka000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shibataka000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shibataka000/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4549\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nthis PR updates wait_for_downstream dependency to be satisfied for tasks that are skipped.  This is desirable because \r\n(a) depends_on_past, which this is interacts with, allows skipped tasks\r\n(b) documentation for wait_for_downstream mentions it is to avoid resource conflicts, which are de facto avoided when a task is skipped\r\n\r\nSee e.g. discussion at http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/airflow-dev/201609.mbox/%3CCAHEEp7UTGPjVKgww9_9N5FUpNU+PSKF3RmBvXUGK5dxb6bhjbw@mail.gmail.com%3E \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDagRunTest.test_wait_for_downstream\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-21T05:22:14Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T02:03:34Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T02:03:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c85ddb2a2da6f568062b326959162ba1e206d9a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

conflicts among `gcp_api` dependency versions.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4546\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `gcp_api` extras group pins `google-cloud-bigtable` to version 0.31.0, which pins `google-cloud-core<0.29dev,>=0.28.0`. This is incompatible with several other `gcp_api` requirements, which require `google-cloud-core>=1.0`. This discrepancy has been resolved in `google-cloud-bigtable` version 0.33.0. We should upgrade to fix.\r\n\r\nI looked at the changelog at https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/blob/master/bigtable/CHANGELOG.md and didn't see anything that looked concerning.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-20T15:51:21Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T12:35:18Z","closed_at":"2019-05-20T19:43:59Z","merged_at":"2019-05-20T19:43:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"05bfeec6eac8eec357a2f827ef16b31ea1e1f425","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5174b56b1069ef66eb30eff565de0ae0a243978f","head":{"label":"jmcarp:upgrade-bigtable","ref":"upgrade-bigtable","sha":"5174b56b1069ef66eb30eff565de0ae0a243978f","user":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53240459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzI0MDQ1OQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jmcarp/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jmcarp","id":1633460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM0NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp","html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmcarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jmcarp/airflow","description":"Airflow

breaking change!_\r\n\r\nThis PR creates enum classes for `TriggerRule` and `WeightRule`. Enums simplify the code base and improve in terms of memory usage & performance.\r\n\r\nI had to make a breaking change choice:\r\nIn the BaseOperator we currently support passing both a string (e.g. `\"all_done\"`) and enum member (e.g. `TriggerRule.ALL_DONE`). When using enums, you cannot pass the string value without doing some try except, e.g (in BaseOperator.\\_\\_init\\_\\_):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntrigger_rule = \"all_done\"\r\nif trigger_rule not in TriggerRule:\r\n    try:\r\n        trigger_rule = TriggerRule(trigger_rule)\r\n    except ValueError:\r\n        raise AirflowException(\r\n            \"The trigger_rule must be one of {all_triggers},\"\r\n            \"'{d}.{t}'; received '{tr}'.\"\r\n            .format(all_triggers=TriggerRule.all_triggers(), d=dag.dag_id if dag else \"\", t=task_id, tr=trigger_rule))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest to remove support for passing the string value, this was only used in the qubole example operator and that way we can unify the way for providing trigger_rules and weight_rules. This helps with typing and prevents errors while developing since the IDE can hint enum members. So:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Not possible anymore\r\ntask = DummyOperator(... trigger_rule=\"all_done\" ...)\r\ntask = DummyOperator(... weight_rule=\"downstream\" ...)\r\n\r\n# Only valid way of setting trigger_rule/weight_rule\r\ntask = DummyOperator(... trigger_rule=TriggerRule.ALL_DONE ...)\r\ntask = DummyOperator(... weight_rule=WeightRule.DOWNSTREAM ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4374\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPython 3.4 introduces the Enum type, which simplifies the WeightRule and TriggerRule class a lot. `is_valid` methods were removed because selecting an invalid Enum member will raise an AttributeError.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-18T16:43:45Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T21:24:05Z","closed_at":"2021-09-18T21:24:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"567c182d3a8820defd9a3a09de6fe6514e734ae4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4537\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWas trying to cleanup configuration.py and noticed this `mkdir_p` function which seems to come straight from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/600268. This functionality is now supported by native Python with pathlib, which is also explained in the same post:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npathlib.Path(\"/tmp/path/to/desired/directory\").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR removes `mkdir_p` in favour of pathlib.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-18T13:25:38Z","updated_at":"2019-05-19T17:34:07Z","closed_at":"2019-05-19T17:34:07Z","merged_at":"2019-05-19T17:34:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ecdef7d86bd53b94a75445e39093aff063688e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/811b64c962ae44a578451a8a60231de3eaf5615b","head":{"label":"BasPH:bash-airflow-4537","ref":"bash-airflow-4537","sha":"811b64c962ae44a578451a8a60231de3eaf5615b","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"675c14a7b10f4236872560e826b46857300cbab8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nOn master branch at the time of writing, airflow/jobs.py is 2695 lines long and I think it's time to split the file into a package. This should result in improved code structure.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I preserve the import structure by importing all job classes in `__init__.py`, so that all code importing `airflow.jobs.*` remains working.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCode in `tests/test_jobs.py` was also split, following the same structure as in `/airflow/jobs/`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-18T11:24:59Z","updated_at":"2019-05-19T09:43:01Z","closed_at":"2019-05-19T09:42:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21e1673cd938d6933feb489c6fa5c3887ecce533","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/552ad4cad8e7e18d92ba55f1b710b4d720e81507","head":{"label":"BasPH:bash-split-jobs","ref":"bash-split-jobs","sha":"552ad4cad8e7e18d92ba55f1b710b4d720e81507","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"675c14a7b10f4236872560e826b46857300cbab8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4534\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFollowing up on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5295, there are several redundant `list()` calls around dict comprehensions. This wastes time and is therefore removed in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-18T06:46:52Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T18:47:46Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T18:47:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80a6b669f998f7c06c8bb844921862ffb8bdeac6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect

   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2143\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  * Root cause of this bug is that the `TaskInstance.try_number` property returns a value 1 higher than the completed tries, which is useful for logging.  The TaskTries graph was binding to this property, making it seem as though untried tasks had \"1\" try, and single-try tasks had \"2\".\r\n  * Adds a new read-only property to the `TaskInstance` model to provide count of previous task tries\r\n  * Modify the `tries` view to bind the graph y-axis values to this property instead of `try_number`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  * No tests - property instance is read-only and is only used by graph view.  No existing tests for the `next_try_number` read-only property of this model, so I assume this is ok.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-18T02:46:33Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T22:24:15Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T22:21:49Z","merged_at":"2019-11-20T22:21:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"e969d38d5a8eb8f8b2fc98966ba460592cea0674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5297/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5297/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5297/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1ff771c23579ed077ca1dc977f5e1aeb5434cf67","head":{"label":"mcw0933:AIRFLOW-2143","ref":"AIRFLOW-2143","sha":"1ff771c23579ed077ca1dc977f5e1aeb5434cf67","user":{"login":"mcw0933","id":750196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDE5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933","html_url":"https://github.com/mcw0933","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187305405,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODczMDU0MDU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"mcw0933/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mcw0933","id":750196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MDE5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/750196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933","html_url":"https://github.com/mcw0933","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcw0933/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mcw0933/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4532\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of optimisation to achieve in the DAG and BaseOperator deepcopy methods. In both, we have an iteration as in `stmt_original` shown below. The fastest alternative is `stmt_no_list` which gives a +-28% speedup.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport timeit\r\n\r\nsetup = \"\"\"\r\nimport string\r\n\r\nnums = list(range(25))\r\nchars = [string.ascii_lowercase[i] for i in nums]\r\ntest = dict(zip(nums, chars))\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nstmt_original = \"\"\"\r\nfor k, v in list(test.items()):\r\n    if k not in (3, 7, 18):\r\n        pass\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nstmt_no_list = \"\"\"\r\nfor k, v in test.items():\r\n    if k not in (3, 7, 18):\r\n        pass\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nstmt_exclude_var = \"\"\"\r\nexclude = (3,7,18)\r\nfor k, v in test.items():\r\n    if k not in exclude:\r\n        pass\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nstmt_pre_filter = \"\"\"\r\nexclude = (3,7,18)\r\nfor k,v in {k:v for k,v in test.items() if k not in exclude}.items():\r\n    pass\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\ntimeit_runs = 100000\r\nprint(\"original: \", timeit.timeit(setup=setup, stmt=stmt_original, number=timeit_runs))\r\nprint(\"no list: \", timeit.timeit(setup=setup, stmt=stmt_no_list, number=timeit_runs))\r\nprint(\"no list & exclude var: \", timeit.timeit(setup=setup, stmt=stmt_exclude_var, number=timeit_runs))\r\nprint(\"exclude in dict compr: \", timeit.timeit(setup=setup, stmt=stmt_pre_filter, number=timeit_runs))\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults (lower is better):\r\n```python\r\noriginal:  0.25252830400131643\r\nno list:  0.18099403311498463\r\nno list & exclude var:  0.1814123059157282\r\nexclude in dict compr:  0.38640512502752244\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"no list\" is slightly faster than the \"no list & exclude var\" option. I wouldn't expect it and I'm not exactly sure why, but the data says so 😄 Either way, both are faster than the original implementation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"How to write a good git commit message\":\r\n  i. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  ii. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  iii. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  iv. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  v. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  vi. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4512) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n \r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] New trigger rule - atleast_one_success\r\n\r\nTrigger rules help in defining better dependencies on up stream tasks. There are good number of rules currently defined which are as below\r\n\r\nall_success: (default) all parents have succeeded\r\nall_failed: all parents are in a failed or upstream_failed state\r\nall_done: all parents are done with their execution\r\none_failed: fires as soon as at least one parent has failed, it does not wait for all parents to be done\r\none_success: fires as soon as at least one parent succeeds, it does not wait for all parents to be done\r\nnone_failed: all parents have not failed (failed or upstream_failed) i.e. all parents have succeeded or been skipped\r\nnone_skipped: no parent is in a skipped state, i.e. all parents are in a success, failed, or upstream_failed state\r\ndummy: dependencies are just for show, trigger at will\r\n \r\n\r\nThere can be another rule added here which is atleast_one_success - This waits for all parent tasks to be complete and checks if at least one parent is successful and triggers current task. It differs from one_success as it waits for all parents to be done. \r\n\r\nConsider a very common scenario in data pipelines where you have a number of parallel tasks generating some data. As a downstream task to all these generate tasks, you have a task to collate all data into one collection which has to run if any of the upstream generate is successful and also has to wait for all of them to be done. one_success can't be used as it doesn't wait for other tasks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-16T05:02:15Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T18:03:14Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T10:39:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5070aaa8dcf88ce9055072c0a8b581b76fd01f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7bc56078e312b05fd505ea160c33dbf17dd1af4d","head":{"label":"bharathpalaksha:master","ref":"master","sha":"7bc56078e312b05fd505ea160c33dbf17dd1af4d","user":{"login":"bharathpalaksha","id":342603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha","html_url":"https://github.com/bharathpalaksha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bharathpalaksha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2d89cefa0423d93c72233bfcc251c2421c5c1d40","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

And we can see the parent DAG and its subdags have different `is_paused` state. Currently `SubDagOperator` is using backfill to scheduler the subtasks, which does not respect `is_paused` and will continue to run when the DAG is paused.\r\n\r\nThis PR allow us to pause/un-pause DAGs including its subdags, which guarantees `is_paused` state consistency among DAGs and their subdags. In the future, if we want to change `SubDagOperator` to use normal scheduler (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5279) instead of backfill scheduler, we will also need this PR as normal scheduler respects `is_paused` state.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4059\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ntl;dr Make `SubDagOperator` use normal scheduler instead of backfill scheduler to run subtasks.\r\n\r\nCurrently `SubDagOperator` uses backfill scheduler to schedule tasks in the subdags and there are a few drawbacks:\r\n- Relying on backfill scheduler to schedule tasks in normal `DagRun`.\r\n- `parallelism` is not respected in backfill.\r\n- Tasks in the subdag continues to run even when the DAG is paused.\r\n- You need to specify an executor.\r\n\r\nSummary of implementation:\r\n- `SubDagOperator` creates a `DagRun` for the subdag and will wait until the `DagRun` finish. It will occupy a slot (same behavior as we run backfill in `SubDagOperator`) but we can probably introduce `reschedule` concept like `BaseSensorOperator` to release the slots.\r\n- Scheduler will pick up the `DagRun` and schedule the tasks.\r\n- Yet to be implemented: backfill `SubDagOperator`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4510\r\n  \r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhile initializing a DAG, default_args is being mutated. If another DAG is created in the same file with the same default_args, it gets initialized with the incorrect Timezone information.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt adds a unit test to make sure we don't lose timezone information when there are multiple DAGs with the same default_args dict.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4414\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* Currently it is not possible to make use of QueryExecutionID (the\r\n  unique identifier of the query submitted to Athena) in the tasks that\r\n  follow.\r\n\r\n* This commit changes the situation by making sure QueryExecutionID gets\r\n  pushed to XCom when BaseOperator.do_xcom_push is set to True.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThere currently does not seem to exist a simple way of testing XCom pushing of Operators.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-4494\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4494\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn DaskExecutor, the function that call `subprocess.Popen` use argument `shell=True`, it causes the command `airflow run ...` failed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNow the tests about executor use command `true ...` or `false ...`, they don't need a subcommand. I have no idea how to improve unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4504\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nYou typically open a subprocess with a single string `\"run some command\"` or list of strings `[\"run\", \"some\", \"command\"]` ([recommended by Python to use a list](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/subprocess.html?highlight=recommended%20pass%20args%20sequence#popen-constructor)) , but not a single string in list `[\"run some command\"]`. Technically it will work, but there's no point in doing so. There's an if-statement in `run_command` for running commands this way but it's unused, so I suggest to remove it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4457\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn Some scenarios where the airflow logs are being forwarded to external central destination like splunk, it may be cumbersome to search the logs corresponding to task execution amid all the airflow logs from different loggers.\r\nThere should be a way to append the task logs with some task context to facilitate searching those logs for the debugging or some other purpose.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-09T12:02:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T05:37:24Z","closed_at":"2019-05-14T05:37:05Z","merged_at":"2019-05-14T05:37:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"a968068811a173896eebfcc74f2d87704d0ff4aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f875fe28aa298123541fc0ef64890a032d3539cc","head":{"label":"kani5hk:task_logging","ref":"task_logging","sha":"f875fe28aa298123541fc0ef64890a032d3539cc","user":{"login":"kani5hk","id":47313506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzEzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47313506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk","html_url":"https://github.com/kani5hk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169039175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjkwMzkxNzU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kani5hk/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kani5hk","id":47313506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzEzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47313506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk","html_url":"https://github.com/kani5hk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kani5hk/airflow","description":"Apache

automating Airflow from Jenkins and our workflow looks like this:\r\n * Jenkins job triggers DAG run (using _POST /api/experimental/dags/**<dag_id>**/dag_runs_)\r\n * Airflow API returns response like this: \r\n\r\n`\r\n{\"message\":\"Created <DagRun dag_id @ 2019-05-08 11:42:43+00:00: run_id, externally triggered: True>\"}\r\n`\r\n * Jenkins job parses the response for **execution_date** (2019-05-08T11:42:43 for response above)\r\n * Jenkins job further uses execution_date to check DAG run state using _POST /api/experimental/dags/**<dag_id>**/dag_runs/**<execution_date>**_\r\n * Also Jenkins job generates DAG run UI link\r\n\r\nHere is [the code](https://github.com/doublescoring/jenkins-pipeline-goodness/blob/master/src/main/groovy/airflow.groovy) - how it works.\r\n\r\nActually it is not a good idea to parse message string for execution_date. So it is proposed to add **execution_date** in DAG run trigger API response as a field. It makes it possible to get execution_date directly from the response without dirty and unpredictable parsing. After this improvement API response will be like this:\r\n\r\n`\r\n{'execution_date': '2019-05-08T07:03:09+00:00', 'message': 'Created <DagRun dag_id @ 2019-05-08 07:03:09+00:00: manual__2019-05-08T07:03:09+00:00, externally triggered: True>'}\r\n` \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAsserts added for test_endpoints.test_trigger_dag\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Enhance Task logs by providing the task context\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4457\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn Some scenarios where the airflow logs are being forwarded to external central destination like splunk, it may be cumbersome to search the logs corresponding to task execution amid all the airflow logs from different loggers.\r\nThere should be a way to append the task logs with some task context to facilitate searching those logs for the debugging or some other purpose.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-08T07:51:34Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T12:02:59Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T12:02:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32ccc5a2238f0faec684920126e91225a24be6dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5257/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5257/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5257/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ad2c351234e84d96957628c3d27ed31fa8676ba5","head":{"label":"kani5hk:task_logger","ref":"task_logger","sha":"ad2c351234e84d96957628c3d27ed31fa8676ba5","user":{"login":"kani5hk","id":47313506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzEzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47313506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk","html_url":"https://github.com/kani5hk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169039175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjkwMzkxNzU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kani5hk/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kani5hk","id":47313506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzEzNTA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47313506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk","html_url":"https://github.com/kani5hk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kani5hk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kani5hk/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow manual trigger/scheduled trigger doesn't always work on mssql(azure mssql, mssql 2017, other versions)\r\n\r\n* fixed mssql server as airflow backend. Applies only to sql server 2005  later versions and azure sql db where datetime2 datatype is available. Issue is with execution_date used as primary key in task_instance and a equality comparison column in dag_run. When comparing equality python microsecond precision to sql server, it returns false when the millisecond is non-zero,e.g, 2019-04-20T18:51:35.033. This change will make the execution_date from datetime to datetime(precision=6) matches with mysql precision. The date equality comparision works as desired. Microsoft also recommends to use datetime2.\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, airflow is not usable in sql server and azure sql server db. This fix can also be applied to existing stable branches to make airflow work with mssql server\r\n\r\nClosed #5241 and created this pull request against master as per the suggestion from @potiuk \r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-4471\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4471\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n       -  Changes to documentation in DataProcOperators. \r\n       -  Fixed a bug where templated_fields weren't picked-up correctly (in the case of DataProcPySparkOperator)\r\n       -  Made the kwargs consistent over all dataproc operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-07T13:33:21Z","updated_at":"2019-05-09T08:56:09Z","closed_at":"2019-05-09T08:56:09Z","merged_at":"2019-05-09T08:56:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f276fd4fb3a4ec9df43e72cb52abfcd681a6cda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5250/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5250/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5250/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/019aa75cabd7f50a66f868fe89ab9ea1d2daed78","head":{"label":"martijnvdgrift:martijnvdgrift/AIRFLOW_4471","ref":"martijnvdgrift/AIRFLOW_4471","sha":"019aa75cabd7f50a66f868fe89ab9ea1d2daed78","user":{"login":"martijnvdgrift","id":6614641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTQ2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6614641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvdgrift","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185402321,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU0MDIzMjE=","name":"airflow","full_name":"martijnvdgrift/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"martijnvdgrift","id":6614641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTQ2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6614641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift","html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvdgrift","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martijnvdgrift/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/martijnvdgrift/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBy default, string comparisons in mysql are case-insensitive, so the task ids \"foo\" and \"FOO\" are treated as identical. This means that a dag with those task ids will fail to schedule with a sqlalchemy `IntegrityError` using mysql, but not postgres or sqlite. This situation probably doesn't happen often, and users probably shouldn't use task ids that are identical except for case, but I think we should improve the behavior here. A few options:\r\n\r\nConfigure sqlalchemy to use a binary collation for string id columns under mysql so that string comparisons are case-sensitive.\r\nRequire dag and task ids to be unique regardless of case. This would be a breaking change.\r\nDocument that mysql users should configure mysql to use binary collations for string types by default. This would still show users a 500 if the database isn't configured correctly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-06T14:07:53Z","updated_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:49Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:26:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b374bc3b30a4f48e56a0226485176c88ab4da416","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4463\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFixes the bug by rounding up prior to casting to int\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`test_next_retry_datetime_short_intervals` -> test tasks with short retry intervals to ensure they pass. Without the relevant code-fix in taskintstances.py, this test fails.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-06T13:55:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-11T13:32:22Z","closed_at":"2019-06-11T10:36:30Z","merged_at":"2019-06-11T10:36:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1dceff69ab15f9ce28ea04215a693b81c8a93a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5243/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5243/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5243/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/53fb644e23ab26102f71a223588e763c337da70f","head":{"label":"Chris7:handle-zero-timedelay-retries","ref":"handle-zero-timedelay-retries","sha":"53fb644e23ab26102f71a223588e763c337da70f","user":{"login":"Chris7","id":963909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MzkwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/963909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185201878,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODUyMDE4Nzg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"Chris7/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Chris7","id":963909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MzkwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/963909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7","html_url":"https://github.com/Chris7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chris7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Chris7/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow manual trigger/scheduler…trigger doesn't always work on mssql(azure mssql, mssql 2017, other versions)\r\n\r\n* fix mssql server as airflow backend. Applies only to sql server 2005  later versions and azure sql db. Issue is with execution_date used as primary key in task_instance and a equality comparison column in dag_run. When comparing equality python microsecond precision to sql server, it returns false when the millisecond is non-zero,e.g, 2019-04-20T18:51:35.033. This change will make the execution_date from datetime to datetime2(precision=6) matches with mysql precision. The date equality comparision works as desired.

PR adds Pylint to the CI, initially all files are blacklisted and the idea is to remove from the blacklist and make pylint compatible one-by-one.

There's a discussion to ignore specific messages for specific directories for years: More info: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2584.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes
