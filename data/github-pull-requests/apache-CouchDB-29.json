test was flaky for a variety of reasons:\r\n\r\n * waitForSeq only waited for 3 seconds and on failure it never explitly\r\n   indicated an error and just waited for the comparison below to fail. So made\r\n   it wait for 30 seconds and also throw an exception right away if it fails.\r\n\r\n * Last waitForSeq was used after task was canceled. So it just wasted time\r\n   waiting until timeout as the task was null. So created a function to\r\n   wait for task to be null.\r\n\r\n * waitForSeq spun in a tight do/while loop querying _active_tasks. In some test\r\n   environment with minimal CPU resources that's not the greatest thing to do.\r\n   So made it wait for 0.5 seconds between retries.\r\n\r\n * waitForSeq waited for replication task's through_seq value to match source\r\n   update sequence from source db info. Those don't necessarily match. Instead\r\n   made waitForSeq use the changes feed last sequence since that's what the\r\n   replication task uses to update through_seq.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-14T14:19:14Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T18:09:45Z","closed_at":"2017-07-14T16:14:27Z","merged_at":"2017-07-14T16:14:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"a866f6c873f73d1d67a2610fb8651c215c983c74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/98ef327f1460ccc132506a0987b5803bf94d9337","head":{"label":"cloudant:fix-replication-js-test","ref":"fix-replication-js-test","sha":"98ef327f1460ccc132506a0987b5803bf94d9337","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

currently checks document sizes based on Erlang's external\r\nterm size of the jiffy-decoded document body. This makes sense because that's\r\nwhat used to store the data on disk and it's what manipulated by the CouchDB\r\ninternals.\r\n\r\nHowever erlang term size is not always a good approximation of the size of json\r\nencoded data. Sometimes it can be way off (I've seen 30% off) and It's hard for\r\nusers to estimate or check the external term size beforehand. So for example if\r\nmax_document_size is 1MB, CouchDB might reject user's 600KB json document\r\nbecause Erlang's external term size of that document greater than 1MB.\r\n\r\nRe-encode the data using jiffy and check the size against that. That's a better\r\ncheck but will impact performance.\r\n\r\nAlso this is also not an exact solution.Users' json encoder might insert more\r\nwhitespace (say as indentation), or whitespace after commas, use a different\r\nalgorithm for encoding floating point numbers (scientific notation, represent\r\nexact floating point numbers without a decimal point (5 instead of 5.0 etc.).\r\nSo the size

21f9544 enabled the compaction daemon by default. And commit\r\n3afe3ad disabled the compaction daemon at the start of the compaction\r\ndaemon tests. Unfortunately, the compaction daemon remains active during\r\nall the other EUnit tests. This has resulted in some strange behaviour,\r\nespecially filling the LRU up and `all_dbs_active` errors during tests\r\nthat shouludn't be hitting it otherwise (like\r\n`couchdb_views_tests:couchdb_1283` which monkeys with max_dbs_open ).\r\n\r\nI attempted to override the [compactions] _default line in the file\r\nrel/files/eunit.ini but specifying `_default=` or `_default=[]` did not\r\nprovide the desired behaviour. (This in and of itself is worrying; how would\r\nsomeone disable the compaction daemon in `local.ini` now?)\r\n\r\nThis change disables the _default config as part of\r\n`test_util:start_couch` after startup. This means there is a very brief\r\nperiod during which the daemon is running, but in empirical testing the\r\nonly thing I've seen it manage to do is compact `_dbs` before being\r\ndisabled.\r\n\r\nTested with `make soak-eunit` for 3 hours; this seems to eliminate the\r\n`all_dbs_active` error we've been seeing in CI runs since the compaction\r\ndaemon was enabled by default.\r\n\r\nNow, I realize that this PR is at odds with making sure that all of the\r\nusual things we do in CouchDB work correctly while the compaction daemon\r\nis running in the background, so if you feel strongly about this, don't\r\nhesitate to -1 it.\r\n\r\nNoting here that the alternative is that we can try and fix all of the\r\nsuddenly failing tests - but with all of the DBs that EUnit creates and\r\ndeletes rapidly, the daemon will be working overtime to try and compact\r\nthem all. And many EUnit tests don't delete their databases after\r\nthey're done (which itself is probably another bug). The LRU is\r\nadversely affected as well, as we see in\r\n`couchdb_views_tests:couchdb_1283`, but\r\n`couch_db_tests:should_create_multiple_dbs` would also be affected.\r\n\r\nOther test failures from enabling the compaction daemon: \r\n* #649 \r\n* #643 \r\n\r\nCloses

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR includes 3 small commits to fix up the JS test suite:\r\n\r\n1. Really, truly disable the compaction daemon. (The previous approach wasn't working.)\r\n2. Ensure that every JS test cleans up after itself, removing all old databases before exiting.\r\n3. Disable the flaky `stats.js` test, which needs a complete rewrite to make sense. It was my fault re-enabling it even partially for 2.0. Sorry.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make javascript` and look for all passes.","created_at":"2017-07-07T07:23:56Z","updated_at":"2017-07-07T16:38:32Z","closed_at":"2017-07-07T16:38:14Z","merged_at":"2017-07-07T16:38:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1b5e1302b438dfdcf9f58538212ec0b9485a222","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/2c280f2a680896b981b034e8537b1e9bc8a77e5c","head":{"label":"apache:fix-js-tests","ref":"fix-js-tests","sha":"2c280f2a680896b981b034e8537b1e9bc8a77e5c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n[Issue 548](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/548) points out that tests fail randomly when using ad-hoc queries (i.e. create a design doc, query it, remove it again). Though I can't reproduce it (not even by doing this cycle three times in a row without wait in-between), there is a solution by simply adding comments to the map function (hence changing the signature, allowing two otherwise similar views to co-exist. As it's hardly production relevant (design docs likely won't and probably shouldn't be created and removed all the time - it's a performance no-go in most cases), we actually get *better* tests as they really indicate if things go wrong (instead of failing randomly and being ignored after some time).\r\n\r\nIn short: improves the quality of javascript tests\r\n\r\n## Testing

Overview\r\n\r\nWe don't set db open options to `fabric_view_map` and missing `user_ctx` when opening databases. For admin-only database we inject `user_ctx` for after doc check, pulling it from passed accumulator with assumption it is always `#vacc` record. This is incorrect in case of `list` or `mango` queries and breaks fabric abstraction, where it is spec'ed for acc to be type `any()`\r\n\r\nThis patch allows to pass db open options  and `user_ctx` along with it to `fabric:query_view/7` and modifies chttpd show and view handlers accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nJavascript test suite should pass:\r\n```\r\nmake javascript\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor manual check on admin-only database the following should work:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho '{\"name\": \"demo\", \"password\": \"apple\", \"roles\": [], \"type\": \"user\"}' | curl -u $CRED http://localhost:15984/_users/org.couchdb.user:demo\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\necho '{\"views\": {\"names\": {\"map\": \"function(doc) { emit(doc.name); }\"}}, \"lists\": {\"names\": \"function(head, req) { var row; while (row = getRow()) { send(\\\"name: \\\" + row.key + \\\"\\\\n\\\"); } }\"}}}' | curl -u $CRED http://localhost:15984/_users/_design/users \r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\r\n```\r\n$ curl -u $CRED http://localhost:15984/_users/_design/users/_view/names?include_docs=true\r\n$ curl  -u $CRED \"http://localhost:15984/_users/_design/users/_list/names/names\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n##

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nTo decom a node, one normally inserts {\"decom\":true} into that node's\r\ndocument via the admin /nodes endpoint. However, it's easy to\r\naccidentally insert {\"decom\":\"true\"} instead, in which case the\r\ncurrent mem3 allowed_nodes logic will include that node as allowed,\r\nwhich is probably not what was intended, and ultimately result in \"500\r\nbadard\" errors sent to the client.\r\n\r\nThis changes the allowed_nodes algorithm to also accept {\"decom\":\"true\"}\r\nto decom a node.\r\n\r\nThanks to Nick Vatamaniuc for discovering this shortcoming.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI've included a new unit test for this code, but I wonder if it's more trouble than it's worth.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\n<!-- If this is a significant change, please file a separate issue at:\r\n

there was a race between reporting the source update  sequence\r\nbetween the the workers and the changes readers. Each one used separate\r\nincrementing timestamp sequences.\r\n\r\nIn some cases that lead to pending changes being stuck. For example, if changes\r\nreader reported the highest sequence with timestamp 10000, then later workers\r\nreported it with sequences 5000, 5001, 5002, then all those reports would be\r\nignored and users would see an always lagging pending changes value reported\r\nwith timestamp 1000.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to thread the last_sequence update through the changes queue to\r\nthe changes manager, so only its timestamp sequence will be used.

Overview\r\n\r\nTest `couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests` periodically crashes with database not been idle after compaction completion. The reason been a race condition when index compacting process can be a bit slow (2ms is enough) to release db monitor after `swap_compacted` call. There are also amount of CRASH messages in test log related to premature unload of meck and indexers crashes on teardown, which makes troubleshooting harder.\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses the CRASH messages by refactoring the test's setup and teardown and adding monitor on compacting process to resolve the race.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make eunit apps=couch suites=couchdb_compaction_daemon_tests tests=compaction_daemon_test_` should successfully pass and `couch.log` in `src/couch/.eunit` shouldn't have CRASH messages.\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue

Overview\r\n\r\nThe previous version of ddoc_cache was written to rely on evicting\r\nentries after a maximum TTL. This leads to issues on clusters that have\r\na large amount of load on databases with a large Q. What ends up\r\nhappening is that when a design document is evicted we suddenly have a\r\nthundering herd scenario as every client attempts to reinsert it into\r\nthe cache.\r\n\r\nThis change instead relies on a monitor process for each cache entry\r\nthat periodically attempts to refresh the cache. This way normal clients\r\naccessing a popular design document will never hit a point where it\r\ndoesn't exist in cache. And we'll have at most one reader trying to\r\nwrite the value.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nmake eunit apps=ddoc_cache\r\n\r\nYou'll find its got 100% test coverage if you enable cover.\r\n\r\nOne note on the tests that's a bit different than other suites.

Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nIn two places where we calculate the ExternalSize of the document body,\r\nwe use the Summary which is a compressed version of the doc body. We\r\nchange this to use the actual ejson body. In copy_docs we don't have\r\naccess to the #doc record so we can't access the meta where we store\r\nthe ejson body. Unfortunately, this means we have to decompress the\r\ndocument body after reading it from disk.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nPerformance tests were conducted to compare pre-fix External Size values and post-fix External Size Values.

Overview\r\nAdding this header allows the client to request that only Non-Essential\r\nor All headers are removed from the response. This will decrease the\r\nsize of the response.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to remove all headers that a non-browser client would not need. \r\nI've had to leave `Server` header in otherwise Mochiweb adds its very lame/snarky header in its place.\r\n\r\nThere are two options `Non-Essential` which removes everything except caching headers. And then `All` which removes everything except Content-length, Content-Type, Server, Date.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\ncurl -v --header \"X-Couch-Exclude-Headers: Non-Essential\"

Overview\r\n\r\nThere are a race condition in `restore_backup_db_file` function between couch_server eviction of an old db updater and a test quering view on restored db file. The query in test can get old record for the updater and then crash with `noproc` exception.\r\n\r\nThis change makes `restore_backup_db_file` to wait until start of the new db updater.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe following should pass:\r\n\r\n`make eunit apps=couch suites=couchdb_views_tests tests=backup_restore_test_`\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\nFixes #565\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nBefore change, the view index files were renamed in place if the corresponding database was deleted and \"enable_database_recovery\" configuration item is set to true. This allows view index files to be re-used if database is recovered. \r\nHowever, these deleted view files are spread widely and  may become orphans. This makes disk management difficult. \r\nIn order to help better manage disk, the change is to implement automatic movement of index files into centralized place when main database is deleted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nmake check apps=couch

Overview\r\n\r\nThe timeout=1 (1ms) parameter would some times trigger extra newlines to be\r\nincluded in the response body. The use of `binary:split/2` would then\r\nreturn different portions of the body depending on timing in the\r\ncluster. This change adds a helper function to split out all newlines in\r\nthe response and then returns the last non-empty line.\r\n\r\nThis also removes introspection of the clustered update sequence

Overview\r\n\r\nTo test a config listener's restart we are deleting event handler in config_event and then immediately checking event manager.\r\n\r\nThis creates race when we can be a slightly early and catch old handler yet to be removed or slightly late and get new handler that already been installed.\r\n\r\nThis patch trying to address this by doing the check immediately after old handler exits and then incrementally waiting for new handler to be installed.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun for an isolated test:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake eunit apps=couch_log suites=couch_log_config_listener_test tests=couch_log_config_test_\r\n```\r\n\r\n## GitHub issue number\r\n\r\nFixes #581 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n-

full discussion is in #559, but here is a summary.\r\n\r\nThrough instrumentation of ddoc_cache and ets_lru I suspect that this is\r\ncaused by cache eviction happening after the second GET. While I didn't\r\ninstrument exactly where the GET occurs it's clear that it's fairly\r\nlate, certainly after the PUT 201 is returned, and likely after the\r\nsubsequent GET actually reads from ddoc_cache.\r\n\r\nAfter applying a change to allow me to completely disable the ddoc_cache\r\n(-ddoc_cache max_objects 0 in vm.args) I ran the test on a loop\r\novernight, and the test never failed (>1000 executions). Previously the\r\ntest would fail every 20-30 executions.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: we can't guarantee immediate ddoc_cache eviction on a ddoc\r\nupdate, even for a single .couch file on a single node. (For obvious\r\nreasons we definitely can't guarantee this in a cluster configuration.)\r\n\r\nI will document this as a backwards compatibility change in 2.0 and\r\nforward with a separate checkin to couchdb-documentation.\r\n\r\nThanks to @rnewson @janl and @davisp for helping track this one down!\r\n\r\nThis checkin also includes an improvement to the output when a JS test\r\nfails a notEquals assertion.\r\n\r\nCloses #559

Overview\r\n\r\nOur Jenkins setup has been using the traditional Jenkins definition, with a job driven by a shell script sitting in the apache/couchdb-ci repository, and a further script baked into each Docker image. To maintain the build process, ~8GB of new images have to be pushed to Docker Hub, which isn't practical or scalable.\r\n\r\nWe also now have requests to have Jenkins securely drive our binary deployment process, by triggering .deb/.rpm/Docker/snap builds. With a classic Jenkins job, we have to use dependent/downstream builds to trigger this behaviour, requiring more manual setup in the Jenkins web UI that is difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Jenkinsfile that uses the new declarative pipeline syntax introduced to Jenkins in February 2017.  It's similar to a .travis.yml file but with additional functionality for a multi-stage pipeline, and extra functionality provided by various Jenkins plugins. For instance, the build automatically archives a `make dist` tarball to Jenkins with each build.\r\n\r\nA new *multibranch* pipeline job has been defined in Jenkins pointing to our repository. Only minimal configuration was required:\r\n\r\n* Generic credentials were provided for a GitHub API key to poll the couchdb repository for branches and changes.\r\n* `couchdb-vm2.a.o` CouchDB credentials were specified for the logfile uploader.\r\n* The job is set to only build these origin branches: `master 2.1.x jenkins-pipeline`. No PRs (merged or unmerged, forked or not) are being built at this time due to the heavyweight nature of our Jenkins build - let's leave those to Travis.\r\n* The job is set up to keep only the last 10 build result logfiles and archived artefacts.\r\n\r\nMinor changes were also required to the logfile uploader due to changes in the environment variables available in the multibranch pipeline build.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nThe job is live in Jenkins already. You can see the [list of branches](https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/CouchDB/branches/) that have run, as well as a [list of recent activity](https://builds.apache.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/CouchDB/activity).\r\n\r\nAcross 4 runs on this branch, we have 1 success and 3 failures. The failures are of 3 sorts:\r\n* `docker pull` sometimes hangs on a Jenkins node ([bug here](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/12823))\r\n* `couchjs` still segfaults under Jenkins, most often on CentOS 6/7, but at least once in these 4 runs on Debian 8.\r\n* There is one failure due to an eunit context teardown. This is an odd new failure type. The logs were successfully uploaded to `couchdb-vm2.a.o` for further analysis, just as they should have been.\r\n\r\nNote that because I have renamed the job, some of the Blue Ocean links to logfiles don't show up. You can use the Jenkins classic view to access these logs (click the Exit icon at the top left to get there.)\r\n\r\nOne final change to the email address for notifications (currently just to me) will be made and squashed before I push this assuming +1. Emails will go to notifications@couchdb.a.o unless otherwise requested.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [X]

Overview\r\n\r\nWith certain data sets, performance of the `_changes` feed with the `doc_ids` filter falls off a cliff when the number of supplied `doc_ids` exceeds 100.\r\n\r\nThis change allows configuration of the poor performance threshold:\r\n\r\n### Previous default\r\n```\r\n[changes]\r\nmax_doc_ids = 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Always perform poorly\r\n```\r\n[changes]\r\nmax_doc_ids = 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Perform poorly when more than 10000 doc IDs are supplied\r\n```\r\n[changes]\r\nmax_doc_ids = 10000\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nGet a big dataset, and compare the performance of `_changes` requests with the `doc_ids` filter when:\r\n```\r\n[changes]\r\nmax_doc_ids = 0\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n[changes]\r\nmax_doc_ids = 100\r\n```\r\nwith 100 or less doc_ids.\r\n\r\n## Jira issue number\r\n\r\nFixes: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-3425\r\nRelated: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COUCHDB-1288\r\n\r\n## Related Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nIf minimum checkpointed sequence is greater or equal to source db sequence,\r\ndo not start an internal replication task. The typical case is when checkpoint\r\nsequence is equal to the db sequence. Previously replication task was started\r\nalways wrote a checkpoint document even if no database changes. This resulted\r\nin a flurry of writes during cluster startup.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n* Start 3 node dev cluster with ./dev/run\r\n* Create a database\r\n* Stop cluster\r\n* Start cluster again\r\n* Connect with ./dev/remsh\r\n* After 10-20 seconds sample `couchdb.database_writes` statistic:`couch_stats:sample([couchdb,database_writes]).`\r\n* On master it would 128 or so\r\n*

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously the test relied in the assumption that there are no\r\ncouch_tasks which are running concurrently.

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a second attempt to fix `_local_docs` end-point. The [previous one](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/488) didn't work on big enough btree_local, because local btree doesn't have reduction fun, so reuse of `couch_db_updater:btree_by_id_reduce/2` was crashing on a bad match as soon as btree_local was getting kp_node. Also using full fold to calculate `total_rows` value turned out to be resource expensive when a database have significant number of local documents.\r\n\r\nThis fix avoids calculating of `total_rows` and `offset` instead always setting them to `null` and also setting to `null` `update_seq` when requested, since it doesn't have meaning in context of local documents.\r\n\r\nA fabric module `fabric_view_all_docs.erl` was copied and modified as `fabric_view_local_docs.erl`, because re-using it for processing of both types of the documents was getting rather convoluted.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nUnit tests for all invoked dependencies could be run as `make eunit apps=chttpd,fabric,couch_mrview`. There are updated suite `couch_mrview_local_docs_tests` in `couch_mrview`.\r\n\r\nFrom HTTP perspective end-point `/{db}/_local_docs` supports all the query parameters of `/{db}/_all_docs` with the difference that `offset`, 'total_rows` and `update_seq` always return `null`.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nCOUCHDB-3337\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the

Overview\r\n\r\nThis update makes git to ignore .eunit and .rebar subdirs for all dependencies instead of specifying them in .gitignore file individually.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun `make eunit` and then `git status` on master to see list of untracked `.eunit` directories. Check out this branch and run `git status` again to confirm that the directories are not shown anymore.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n- [ ] I will not forget to update [rebar.config.script](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/rebar.config.script)\r\n

Unfortunately, using simply data size and disk size to calculate this prediction is misleading due to conflicts and attachments. This approach logs disk size pre and post compaction for db and view shard files. The hope is that with enough data points, users can run regression analysis to heuristically determine a compaction result.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTo see the output, one can connect to a node and run compaction on db or view to see the log result. \r\n  ```{ok, Db} = couch_db:open(<<\"shards/00000000-1fffffff/mydb.1494471596\">>, []).```\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nThis commit is intended to improve failure analysis in Travis and\r\nJenkins runs by uploading couch log files after failed test runs.\r\n\r\nA new script has been added that, upon invocation from the top-level\r\ndirectory, tars up all EUnit logfiles and the `dev/logs/node1.log` file.\r\nIt then constructs a document based on the running environment (Travis,\r\nJenkins, manual). The document is posted to a CouchDB instance running\r\non couchdb-vm.apache.org with credentials passed in the COUCHAUTH\r\nenvironment variable.\r\n\r\nThe `.travis.yml` file has been updated to install the script's\r\nprerequisites (python-requests) and with the secret credentials, and to\r\ninstruct travis to run the log uploader after any test failure. Similar\r\nsteps will be taken to reconfigure Jenkins after these changes are\r\nmerged to master.\r\n\r\nThe `test/javascript/run` harness had to be modified to terminate after\r\nthe first failure. This is because each new test wipes the logfile of\r\nthe previous run. All tests can still be run, regardless of failure, by\r\nspecifing the `-a/--all` flag, however it is expected that the reduction\r\nin test suite execution time when a test fails will be appreciated by\r\nmany.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIn the process of preparing this branch, Travis has already run multiple\r\ntimes. I used a now-reverted checkin on the branch that forced a test\r\nto fail to validate that the script worked correctly. One such build is:\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/couchdb/builds/230990140\r\n\r\nInterestingly, one of the jobs in that run actually encountered a new\r\ntest case failure:\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/couchdb/jobs/230990141\r\n\r\nNote that the URL of the uploaded tarball is displayed at the end\r\nof the logfile (behind the `after_failure` twisty.) \r\n\r\nFor the duration of this PR, you can access the uploaded logs with\r\nthe username/password combination `guest:guest`. After merging,\r\nCouchDB devs will be given access individually as desired and the\r\nguest login will be disabled.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nTake your pick of any JIRA ticket on which there is a currently failing test that we can't diagnose because the couch logfiles are missing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Overview\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the original change in COUCHDB-3298 ends up hurting\r\ndisk usage when a view emits large amounts of data (i.e., more than\r\nhalf of the btree chunk size). The cause for this is that instead of\r\nwriting single element nodes it would instead prefer to write kv nodes\r\nwith three elements. While normally we might prefer this in memory, it\r\nturns out that our append only storage this causes a significantly more\r\namount of trash on disk.\r\n\r\nWe can show this with a few trivial examples. Imagine we write KV's a\r\nthrough f. The two following patterns show the nodes as we write each\r\nnew kv.\r\n\r\n    Before 3298:\r\n\r\n    []\r\n    [a]\r\n    [a, b]\r\n    [a, b]', [c]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]', [e]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]', [e, f]\r\n\r\n    After 3298:\r\n\r\n    []\r\n    [a]\r\n    [a, b]\r\n    [a, b, c]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d, e]\r\n    [a, b]', [c, d]', [e, f]\r\n\r\nThe thing to realize here is which of these nodes end up as garbage. In\r\nthe first example we end up with [a], [a, b], [c], [c, d], and [e] nodes\r\nthat have been orphaned. Where as in the second case we end up with\r\n[a], [a, b], [a, b, c], [c, d], [c, d, e] as nodes that have been\r\norphaned. A quick aside, the reason that [a, b] and [c, d] are orphaned\r\nis due to how a btree update works. For instance, when adding c, we read\r\n[a, b] into memory, append c, and then during our node write we call\r\nchunkify which gives us back [a, b], [c] which leads us to writing [a,\r\nb] a second time.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit of this patch is to realize when its possible to reuse\r\na node that already exists on disk. It achieves this by looking at the\r\nlist of key/values when writing new nodes and comparing it to the old\r\nlist of key/values for the node read from disk. By checking to see if\r\nthe old list exists unchanged in the new list we can just reuse the old\r\nnode. Node reuse is limited to when the old node is larger than 50% of\r\nthe chunk threshold to maintain the B+Tree properties.\r\n\r\nThe disk usage improvements this gives can also be quite dramatic. In\r\nthe case above when we have ordered keys with large values (> 50% of the\r\nbtree chunk size) we find upwards of 50% less disk usage. Random keys\r\nalso benefit as well though to a lesser extent depending on disk size\r\n(as they will often be in the middle of an existing node which prevents\r\nour optimization).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n$ make check\r\n\r\nAlso, see @nickva's script for testing that he's written. I'll make him add details to this PR once its opened.\r\n\r\n## JIRA issue number\r\n\r\nCOUCHDB-3298\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [x] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n\r\nNote for documentation, this isn't user visible behavior. Though we will want to call out that we'll use less disk space in our release

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently if we have a document like this:\r\n```\r\ndoc = {\r\n  name: 'Garren',\r\n  activities: []\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then create a selector like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfind({selector: {\r\n   activities: {\r\n      $allMatch: {\r\n        ['fishing', 'golf']\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nCouchDB mango will return the above document. This doesn't seem correct since it doesn't actually match the `$allMatch` selector. This PR changes that so that an empty document is false.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nThere is an additional test added to the Mango tests to prove this works.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes;\r\n- [ ] I will not forget to update

Overview\r\n\r\nHandle non-default _replicator dbs in _scheduler/docs endpoint.\r\n\r\nPreviously _scheduler/docs assumed only the default _replicator db.\r\n\r\nTo provide consistency and to allow disambiguation between a db named\r\n'db/_replicator' and the document named 'db/_replicator' in the\r\ndefault replicator db, access to the single document API is changed to\r\nalways require the replicator db. That is `/docid` should not be\r\n`/_replicator/docid`.\r\n\r\nNow these kinds of paths are accepted after `_scheduler/docs`:\r\n\r\n * `/` : all docs from default _replicator db\r\n * `/_replicator` : all docs from default replicator db\r\n * `/other%2f_replicator` : non-default replicator db, urlencoded\r\n * `/other/_replicator` : non-default replicator db, unencoded\r\n * `/other%2f_replicator/docid` : doc from a non-default db, urlencoded\r\n * `/other/_replicator/docid` : doc from a non-default db, db is unencoded\r\n\r\nBecause `_replicator` is not a valid document ID, it's possible to unambiguously\r\nparse unescaped db paths.\r\n\r\nIssue: #506\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTry all the above URL patterns using a default and a non-default `_replicator` db.\r\n\r\n## Issue number\r\n\r\nIssue: #506\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly;\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests;\r\n- [ ] Documentation reflects the changes; (will make a separate PR for this)\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-08T15:59:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-09T20:39:26Z","closed_at":"2017-05-09T20:39:24Z","merged_at":"2017-05-09T20:39:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"c3d540410a37ab6137efd86c05c7de722ea6b499","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":594289920,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyODk5MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/api","name":"api","color":"BFD4F2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":594290095,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyOTAwOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/replication","name":"replication","color":"BFD4F2","default":false,"description":null},{"id":594290317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTQyOTAzMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"FF9F96","default":true,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/cbee9a34105933f9f84fb1818174a74095cfaf8c","head":{"label":"cloudant:gh-508-custom-rep-dbs-in-scheduler-docs","ref":"gh-508-custom-rep-dbs-in-scheduler-docs","sha":"cbee9a34105933f9f84fb1818174a74095cfaf8c","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nTravis has 2 build environments: containerised and VM based.  Right now\r\n`sudo:false` selects containers, while `sudo:required` selects the VM\r\nbased. Container-based builds guarantee 2 CPU cores and boot faster.\r\nWe've been using the latter because we needed a bunch of\r\n`apt-get install` commands. But Travis added native (non-sudo) support\r\nto install packages in containers, and we didn't notice.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches us to `sudo:false` and uses the new `apt` block to\r\ninstall required packages.\r\n\r\nThe PR also updates our Erlang build matrix, using the latest minor\r\nrelease of each major version we support, and prepares us to enable\r\nIRC notifications to `#couchdb-dev` once the test suite is reliable\r\nagain (currently disabled.)\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\nCheck the Travis build results on this PR.
