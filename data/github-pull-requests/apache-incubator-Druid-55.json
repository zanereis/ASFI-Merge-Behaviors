Description\r\nI loved the idea of the Javascript aggregator - the flexibility of being able to define arbitrary computations across any number of inputs to accumulate values is very powerful. But, it turns out it was a bit _too_ powerful due to the number of exploitive things you can do with it to the host machine, so it broke my heart. Additionally, it was limited to only supporting aggregations of double types, which really cuts down on the expressiveness possible.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I have re-imagined the concept of such a flexible aggregator, but sandboxed, using native Druid expressions. Further, this `ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory` really rounds out the role of the Druid expression system in the query engine. With its introduction, Druid native expressions can now be used to perform a \"fold\" or \"reduce\" operation on any number of input columns, in addition to the previously possible \"map\" (`ExpressionVirtualColumn`), \"filter\" (`ExpressionFilter`) and post-transform (`ExpressionPostAggregator`).\r\n\r\n`ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory` also supports all native Druid expression types, including array types, which means that it can be used to build things such as `ARRAY_AGG` and `GROUP_CONCAT` and similar functionality.\r\n\r\n`ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory` offers near complete control over the `AggregatorFactory` with expressions. \r\n| property | description | required |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `name` | aggregator name | true |\r\n| `fields` | aggregator input columns | true |\r\n| `accumulatorIdentifier` | variable which identifies the accumulator value in the fold and combine expressions | false (default `__acc`)|\r\n| `initialValue` | initial value of the accumulator for `fold` (and `combine`, if `InitialCombineValue` is null) expression | true |\r\n| `initialCombineValue` | initial value of the accumulator for `combine` expression | false (default `initialValue`) |\r\n| `fold` | expression to accumulate values from `fields`. The result of the expression will be stored in `accumulatorIdentifier` and available to the next computation. | true |\r\n| `combine` | expression to combine the results of various `fold` expressions. If not defined and `fold` has a single input column in `fields`, then the `fold` expression may be used, otherwise the input is available to the expression as the `name`| false (default to `fold` expression if and only if the expression has a single input in `fields`)|\r\n| `compare` | comparator expression which can only refer to 2 input variables, `o1` and `o2`, where `o1` and `o2` are the output of `fold` or `combine` expressions, and must adhere to the Java comparator contract. If not set, this will try to fall back to an output type appropriate comparator | false |\r\n| `finalize` | finalize expression which can only refer to a single input variable, `o`, and is used to perform any final transformation of the output of `fold` or `combine` expressions. If not set, then the value is not transformed | false |\r\n| `maxSizeBytes` | maximum size in bytes that variably sized aggregator output types such as strings and arrays are allowed to grow before the aggregation will fail. | false (8192 bytes) |\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples (some contrived)\r\n\r\n\"count\" aggregator\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"expression_count\",\r\n      \"fields\": [],\r\n      \"initialValue\": \"0\",\r\n      \"fold\": \"__acc + 1\",\r\n      \"combine\": \"__acc + expression_count\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"sum\" aggregator\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"expression_sum\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"column_a\"],\r\n      \"initialValue\": \"0\",\r\n      \"fold\": \"__acc + column_a\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"array\" aggregator, sorted by array length\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"expression_array_agg_distinct\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"column_a\"],\r\n      \"initialValue\": \"[]\",\r\n      \"fold\": \"array_set_add(__acc, column_a)\",\r\n      \"combine\": \"array_set_add_all(__acc, expression_array_agg_distinct)\",\r\n      \"compare\": \"if(array_length(o1) > array_length(o2), 1, if (array_length(o1) == array_length(o2), 0, -1))\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\"group_concat\" aggregator, sorted by array length\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"expression_group_concat_distinct\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"column_a\"],\r\n      \"initialValue\": \"[]\",\r\n      \"fold\": \"array_set_add(__acc, column_a)\",\r\n      \"combine\": \"array_set_add_all(__acc, expression_array_agg_distinct)\",\r\n      \"compare\": \"if(array_length(o1) > array_length(o2), 1, if (array_length(o1) == array_length(o2), 0, -1))\",\r\n      \"finalize\": \"array_to_string(o, ',')\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\ndecomposed \"sum\" aggregator, where instead of merging by summing it merges into an array of each individual sum, before finally summing values in a finalizer\r\n```json\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"expression\",\r\n      \"name\": \"expression_decomposed_sum\",\r\n      \"fields\": [\"column_a\"],\r\n      \"initialValue\": \"0.0\",\r\n      \"initialCombineValue\": \"<DOUBLE>[]\",\r\n      \"fold\": \"__acc + column_a\",\r\n      \"combine\": \"array_concat(__acc, expression_decomposed_sum)\",\r\n      \"finalize\": \"fold((x, __acc) -> x + __acc, o, 0.0)\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nVariably sized results such as string and array types are controlled with a maximum byte setting. Unlike some other aggregators like string first/last, the expression aggregator will currently fail if the size grows too large instead of silently truncating.\r\n\r\nSince array types can get quite large, i've added `array_set_add` and `array_set_add_all` which allows working with array types as sets so that they can contain only unique values (which also allows for modeling things such as use of distinct keyword with SQL functions such as `ARRAY_AGG` and `GROUP_CONCAT`).\r\n\r\nI have not actually documented the native expression aggregator itself in this PR yet, because I am unsure if it is ready for large scale use quite yet, but would consider adding it to the native querying docs perhaps with a disclaimer.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ExprEval`\r\n * `Parser`\r\n * `ExpressionLambdaAggregatorFactory`\r\n * `ExpressionLambdaAggregator`\r\n * `ExpressionLambdaBufferAggregator`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nFollow on to #10676. \r\n\r\nThe main change is adding `segmentAvailabilityWaitTimeMs` to `IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReportData`. This is the milliseconds that a task waited for its segments to be handed off to Historical nodes. If there is no wait for handoff, the value is simply 0. Otherwise the handoff value can be between 0 and the configured timeout.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I made a small refactor of `AbstractBatchIndexTask#waitForSegmentAvailability`. The method now sets the value for `segmentAvailabilityConfirmationCompleted` as well as returns the boolean value assigned to that variable. In the past the code only returned the boolean and relied on the caller to set the value, this seemed like poor practice.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReportData`\r\n * `AbstractBatchIndexTask`\r\n \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

feature to automatically remove audit logs based on retention period\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe currently already have a tasklog auto cleanup based on duration (time to retained) introduced in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/3677. This PR adds a similar auto cleanup based on duration (time to retained) but for the audit table (using the coordinator duty instead of OverlordHelper). \r\n\r\nThis is useful when Druid user has a high churn of task / datasource in a short amount of time causing the metadata store size to grow uncontrollably. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, `CAST` is ignored in the query plan when you use certain aggregators on string columns after case. Taking a query, `SELECT APPROX_QUANTILE_DS(CAST(dim1 as DOUBLE), 0.01) FROM foo`, as a example, Druid creates a query plan like below.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\" : \"timeseries\",\r\n  \"dataSource\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"table\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"foo\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"intervals\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"intervals\",\r\n    \"intervals\" : [ \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\" ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"descending\" : false,\r\n  \"virtualColumns\" : [ ],\r\n  \"granularity\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"all\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"aggregations\" : [ {\r\n    \"type\" : \"DoublesSketchAggregatorFactory\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"a0:agg\",\r\n    \"fieldName\" : \"dim1\",\r\n    \"k\" : 128\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"postAggregations\" : [ {\r\n    \"type\" : \"DoublesSketchToQuantilePostAggregator\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"a0\",\r\n    \"field\" : {\r\n      \"type\" : \"fieldAccess\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"a0:agg\",\r\n      \"fieldName\" : \"a0:agg\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fraction\" : 0.009999999776482582\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, this query always returns `0.0` because strings cannot be casted to numbers implicitly. This PR fixes this issue by keeping `CAST` when it casts from string to a number. \r\n\r\nThis PR additionally fixes NPE in `ApproximateHistogramBufferAggregator` when the input column has nulls. Finally, some sqlAggregator tests are refactored to use help functions in `BaseCalciteQueryTest`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a new configuration that skip storing audit payload if payload size exceed limit and skip storing null fields for audit payload\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAudit log such as coordinator.compaction.config can get very large as datasources and their configurations churn. This can cause problems such as \r\n- Metadata database taking up too much space / running out of storage space\r\n- Configuration change (such as compaction configuration) failing as we are not able to insert new row into audit table due to exceeding the database size limit (max_allowed_packet, etc) \r\n\r\nThis PR introduce a new configuration that skip storing audit payload if payload size exceed configured limit. The default value is set to -1 which disables this check, meaning Druid will always store audit payload regardless of it's size. This PR also skip storing null fields for audit payload in the effort of saving storage space as those are unnecessary. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x]

dropExisting flag for Compaction configurable and add warning documentations\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11025 I have introduced a new option for ingestion task to drop (mark unused) all existing segments that are contained by the interval in the ingestionSpec. However, it was pointed out after the PR was merged that this new option can cause temporary data unavailability for data within the specified interval of the ingestion task. Compaction task created manually and by auto compaction were hardcoded to always use the new dropExisting flag in PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11025. This PR make dropExisting flag for Compaction task configurable and set the default behavior when dropExisting is not specified to not use the dropExisting functionality (which is the same behavior as before the PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11025). This PR also adds documentation with warning to temporary data unavailability if dropExisting flag is used.\r\n\r\n**This PR does not contain the fix for this problem yet.

main logic for doing the rewrite is in **JoinableFactoryWrapper**'s\r\nsegmentMapFn method. The requirements are:\r\n\r\n- It must be an inner equi-join.\r\n- The right-hand columns referenced by the condition must not contain any\r\n  duplicate values. (If they did, the inner join would not be guaranteed\r\n  to return at most one row for each left-hand-side row.)\r\n- No columns from the right-hand side can be used by anything other than\r\n  the join condition itself.\r\n\r\n**HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter** is also modified to pass through to\r\nthe base adapter (even allowing vectorization!) in the case where 100%\r\nof join clauses could be rewritten as filters.\r\n\r\nIn support of this goal:\r\n\r\n- Add **Query getRequiredColumns()** method to help us figure out whether\r\n  the right-hand side of a join datasource is being used or not.\r\n- Add **JoinConditionAnalysis getRequiredColumns()** method to help us\r\n  figure out if the right-hand side of a join is being used by later\r\n  join clauses acting on the same base.\r\n- Add **Joinable getNonNullColumnValuesIfAllUnique** method to enable\r\n  retrieving the set of values that will form the \"in\" filter.\r\n- Add **LookupExtractor canGetKeySet()** and **keySet()** methods to support\r\n  LookupJoinable in its efforts to implement the new Joinable method.\r\n- Add **enableRewriteJoinToFilter** feature flag to\r\n  JoinFilterRewriteConfig. The default is disabled.\r\n\r\nTesting strategy:\r\n\r\n- Add join-to-filter conversion tests to JoinableFactorWrapperTests.\r\n- Add getRequiredColumns tests to individual query engines.\r\n- Add getNonNullColumnValuesIfAllUnique tests to LookupJoinable and IndexedTableJoinable.\r\n- Extend BaseCalciteQueryTest's QueryContextForJoinProvider to also\r\n  provide query contexts that enable this rewrite.\r\n- Add some new tests to CalciteQueryTest that are designed to exercise\r\n  this rewrite.

Description\r\n\r\nA follow-up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11047. This PR changes the default to enforce the allow list for JDBC connection properties. `allowUnknownJdbcUrlFormat` still remains as true by default because, at least the known security vulnerability can be exploitable only with MySQL which Druid will always enforce the allow list once it's enabled regardless of `allowUnknownJdbcUrlFormat`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new planner rule, `DruidLogicalValuesRule`, that can interpret logical tuples into `InlineDataSource`. This can be useful when you have a query that Calcite can reduce empty tables into empty tuples. For example, given a query of `SELECT * FROM table WHERE 1 = 0`, Calcite can reduce this query to `SELECT * FROM empty_tuples`.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, Druid used Calcite to execute simple queries without the FROM clause, such as `SELECT 1 + 1`. After this PR, Druid will be able to execute those queries using regular Druid query engine with `InlineDataSource`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nDruid SQL now uses the Druid query engine to process the queries without a `FROM` clause. As a result, you can use all scalar functions and multi-value string functions listed in https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html in those queries. However, the Calcite functions (https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html) will be longer supported for those queries unless Druid supports the same functions. Note that some queries can be reduced to not have a `FROM` clause by the query planner. For example, `SELECT count(*) FROM foo WHERE 1 = 0` can be reduced to `SELECT 0`. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidLogicalValuesRule`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change adds a query parameter `computeUsingClusterView` to loadstatus apis\r\nthat if specified have the coordinator compute undereplication for segments based\r\non the number of services available within cluster that the segment can be replicated\r\non, instead of the configured replication count configured in load rule. This query\r\nparameter is only available when also requesting full loadstatus. A default load rule is\r\ncreated in all clusters that specified that all segments should be replicated 2 times. As\r\nreplicas are forced to be on separate nodes in the cluster, this causes the loadstatus api\r\nto report that there are under-replicated segments when there is only 1 data server in the\r\ncluster. In this case, calling loadstatus api without this new query parameter will always\r\nresult in a response indicating under-replication of segments\r\n\r\n* loadstatus api returns 503 if the cluster object isnt yet initialized. This should only happen\r\n   during the period of time before the coordinator run loop has executed at least once, as this\r\n   object is set during every instantiation of the coordinator run loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\n\r\nThis is a backport PR of https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/48953e3508967f5156c69676432b5d4dd25ea678. [CVE-2021-26919](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd87451fce34df54796e66321c40d743a68fb4553d72e7f6f0bc62ebd%40%3Cdev.druid.apache.org%3E) is filed for the security vulnerability of remote code execution using vulnerable MySQL JDBC properties. This PR adds an allow list for JDBC connection properties that is enforced against every JDBC connections for ingestion and lookups but not metadata stores. The allow list is enforced to connections to postgresql as well as mysql. This is because, even though the known security vulnerability can be exploitable with only MySQL, we want to be conservative and avoid the same issue even with PostgreSQL that can be potentially exploitable in the future. The JDBC connection will fail if it uses a property that is not in the allow list.\r\n\r\nImplementation-wise, this PR uses vendor-specific libraries to parse JDBC connection URLs because the JDBC URL format is diverse across different vendors. This introduces new compatibility issues.\r\n\r\n1) The JDBC driver version in the classpath at runtime should be compatible to the version that is used for URL parsing at compile time. \r\n2) Druid can enforce the allow list to only the JDBC connections that it knows how to parse. However, we should restrict allowed JDBC properties for other database systems to avoid similar issues that can be potentially found in the future.\r\n\r\nAs a result, URL parsing should be a short-term workaround to mitigate this vulnerability. Longer term, we should rather disallow arbitrary URLs in JDBC connections. Instead, we can only accept connection properties individually including host, port and user name.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `JdbcAccessSecurityConfig`\r\n * `JdbcExtractionNamespace`\r\n * `JdbcFetcher`\r\n * `MySQLFirehoseDatabaseConnector`\r\n * `PostgresqlFirehoseDatabaseConnector`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes 2 issues.\r\n\r\n- Implicit EOF in the Antlr grammar file. This makes Antlr parser to think that something might be wrong when it sees EOF and [creates a `NoViableAltException` instance](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/runtime/Java/src/org/antlr/v4/runtime/atn/ParserATNSimulator.java#L467). This could be problematic for queries that Calcite needs to explore large space of candidate queries as the Antlr parser will create exceptions over again even though those exceptions are ignored. The below flame graph shows initializing exceptions was one of the most expensive parts for [the query 19 (giant union query) in SqlBenchmark](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/benchmarks/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/benchmark/query/SqlBenchmark.java#L152). [Implicit EOF can also cause `NoViableAltException` to be thrown incorrectly sometimes](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/issues/118). This PR adds explicit EOF in the grammar file.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-03-12 18-36-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/111016287-d5fb1380-8361-11eb-812f-3e5d7cffeca6.png)\r\n\r\n- `getClass().getSimpleName()` in `BottomUpTransform.checkedProcess()` can be expensive if it is called lots of times. This PR changes it to use `assert`.\r\n\r\n`SqlBenchmark.planSql()` results. Only the query 19 (the giant union query) shows a noticeable improvement.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster\r\n\r\nBenchmark             (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error

Description\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #11004, which improves `BitmapVectorOffset` to report the current set of offsets as \"contiguous\" when they are, in order to take advantage of any optimizations available when processing contiguous vectorized gets. \r\n\r\nIn #11004, I noticed the improvements to vectorized decoding of long values in my column scan benchmarks only seemed to impact a full scan. Looking closer, it was due to how the benchmark uses a `BitmapVectorOffset` to simulate filtering rows, which prior to this pr would _never_ report the current set of offsets as contiguous, even if it was. Since #11004 primarily improved performance of contiguous vectorized gets, when using a `BitmapVectorOffset` we were missing out on these improvements entirely.\r\n\r\nTo help measure the improvements of allowing contiguous blocks to be processed with the contiguous get methods, I improved the benchmarks added in #11004 to now have several different filter \"distributions\" to simulate different filtering patterns, instead of previously only using a random distribution. These include:\r\n- random: `BitmapVectorOffset`, bitmap is set randomly for desired number of rows\r\n- contiguous-start: `NoFilterVectorOffset` from starting offset 0 to desired number of rows\r\n- contiguous-end: opposite end of column as 'contiguous-start'\r\n- contiguous-bitmap-start: `BitmapVectorOffset`, bitmap set from 0 to desired number of rows\r\n- contiguous-bitmap-end: opposite end of column as `contiguous-bitmap-start`\r\n- chunky-1000: `BitmapVectorOffset`, position chosen randomly and up to 1000 contiguous values set until chosen number of rows is set\r\n- chunky-10000: 'chunky-1000' but with chunks of 10k contiguous values\r\n\r\nThe results of this change is a pretty decent improvement to vectorized column read speed when there are contiguous vectors to read:\r\n\r\n![before-after-bitmaps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/112883932-b9f6b200-9083-11eb-8688-1ffb1a827bcb.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark

CVE-2020-13949 which should be addressed in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11028.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of CVEs:\r\n\r\n- CVEs for Solr 7.7.1 ([CVE-2020-13957](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13957), CVE-2019-0193, CVE-2019-17558, [CVE-2020-13941](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13941)): The ranger-security extension has a dependency on `ranger-plugins-audit` which supports [SolrAuditProvider](https://github.com/apache/ranger/blob/release-ranger-2.1.0/agents-audit/src/main/java/org/apache/ranger/audit/provider/solr/SolrAuditProvider.java). These CVEs seem exploitable on the server side only.\r\n- CVEs for jackson-xc and jackson-jaxrs (CVE-2018-14718, CVE-2018-7489): These are used in the ranger-security, ambari-metrics-emitter, and aliyun-oss extensions. I think these vulnerabilities are legitimate at least for the aliyun-oss extension and so created https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11029. For other extensions, I assume they are legit as well as I'm not 100% sure how they are using jackson. However, their latest releases still use the same vulnerable version of 1.9.x, so I would suggest suppressing them until they release a new version that has the fix.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

an option for ingestion task to drop (mark unused) segments that are of the interval in the ingestionSpec\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new option called `dropExisting` in the `ioConfig` for Batch parallel task and Batch simple task. This config default value is `false` (which is the same as the current behavior) and is not required. If this config is set to `true` (and `appendToExisting` is `false` and interval in granularitySpec is given), then the ingestion task would transactionally drop (mark unused) all existing segments that are fully contain by the intervals in the granularitySpec's interval when it publishes new segments (to the metadata store). Note that no segments would be drop (mark unused) if the ingestion fails or publishing of new segments to metadata store fails. Note that if either `appendToExisting` is true or interval is not given in granularitySpec then no segments would be drop even if user try to set `dropExisting` to `true`.\r\n \r\nWhile in most cases, the newly ingested segments would automatically overshadows existing segments and causes those existing segments to be dropped, there are cases where existing segments is no longer needed but yet is not dropped. \r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\nWhen a user try to compact existing segment using a smaller segmentGranularity. For example, existing segment has a interval of 2020-01-01 to 2021-01-01 (YEAR interval). User then try to compact this interval with segmentGranularity of MONTH. However, if we do not have existing data in every month, the compact task would not create MONTH segment of months without data. Thus, we may not have MONTH segments for every month in the interval of 2020-01-01 to 2021-01-01 post-compaction. This would then prevent the original YEAR segment to be drop although the MONTH segments does contains all the data of the YEAR segment. Compaction task can always set `dropExisting` to true as compaction task would always produce segments with all the data of the input intervals.\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\nWhen a user is ingesting with appendToExisting=false (i.e. re-ingesting a datasource) and the new data does not contains time intervals that already existed in the datasource. For example, if a user has the following MONTH segments:\r\nJan has 1 record\r\nFeb has 10 records\r\nMar has 10 records\r\nNow the user is trying to re-ingest with new data that overwrites the existing data (appendToExisting=false). The new data has the following data for each month:\r\nJan has 0 record\r\nFeb has 10 records\r\nMar has 9 records\r\nWithout this new `dropExisting` config, the current result post-ingestion of interval Jan to Mar (even with appendToExisting=false) would be:\r\nJan has 1 record\r\nFeb has 10 records\r\nMar has 9 records\r\nHowever, this is incorrect. The new data has 0 record for Jan and the user would expect to see that Jan has 0 record.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

with segment granularity retrieve incomplete segments from timeline when interval overlap\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAuto-compaction with segment granularity retrieve incomplete segments from timeline when interval overlap.\r\nFor example, if we have segments of YEAR granularity from 2000-01-01 to 2001-01-3001 and a segment of DAY granularity from 2000-01-01 to 2000-01-02. Let's then say that we set auto compaction with a segmentGranularity of MONTH. Auto-compaction will bucket all the existing segments into the new bucket using the configured segmentGranularity (MONTH in this example). When we iterate for segments to compact we will start at the latest and in this case would be the December (2000-12-01 to 2000-12-31) bucket. We would get only the segment with YEAR granularity in this bucket. We would then create a compaction task with the interval 2000-01-01 to 2001-12-31 from the segment we just retrieved. We would also include a sha256OfSortedSegmentIds which would only be the YEAR granularity segment (2000-01-01 to 2001-12-31). However, when the compaction task runs, it would get all segment from 2000-01-01 to 2001-01-01, which would include both segments (a segment of YEAR granularity from 2000-01-01 to 2001-12-31 and a segment of DAY granularity from 2000-01-01 to 2000-01-02)\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem but keeping the original timeline in the CompactibleTimelineObjectHolderCursor that can then we use to fetch the original segments back using the umbrella interval of the transformed segments.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9871\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nIn the jdbc connection, it is invalid to use subquery with `order by`  clause . It will throw excepiton with msg: `Table 'xxx' not found`\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nThe exception was thrown in `DruidPlanner.prepare()`, let 's see  the orginal code:\r\n```\r\n  public PrepareResult prepare(final String sql) throws SqlParseException, ValidationException, RelConversionException\r\n  {\r\n    reset();\r\n    SqlNode parsed = planner.parse(sql);\r\n    SqlExplain explain = null;\r\n    if (parsed.getKind() == SqlKind.EXPLAIN) {\r\n      explain = (SqlExplain) parsed;\r\n      parsed = explain.getExplicandum();\r\n    }\r\n    final SqlNode validated = planner.validate(parsed);\r\n    RelRoot root = planner.rel(validated);\r\n    RelDataType rowType = root.validatedRowType;\r\n\r\n    SqlValidator validator = getValidator();\r\n    RelDataType parameterTypes = validator.getParameterRowType(validator.validate(parsed));\r\n\r\n    if (explain != null) {\r\n      final RelDataTypeFactory typeFactory = root.rel.getCluster().getTypeFactory();\r\n      return new PrepareResult(getExplainStructType(typeFactory), parameterTypes);\r\n    }\r\n    return new PrepareResult(rowType, parameterTypes);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe problem should focus on `validator.validate(parsed)`, we try to validate `parsed` sqlnode to get parameterTypes, However, when we use order by clause, the `order by` item will be pushed down into `sqlSelect` node through the method invoke chain\r\n` SqlNode validated = planner.validate(parsed);` -> `PlannerImpl.validate(SqlNode sqlNode) ` ->`SqlValidatorImpl.validateScopedExpression` ->`SqlValidatorImpl.performUnconditionalRewrites` -> ` SqlSelect.setOrderBy(orderBy.orderList);`,  Therefore, the variable `parsed` was change in the first validation in the \r\nfollowing code fragment:\r\n```\r\n\r\n        // Don't clobber existing ORDER BY.  It may be needed for\r\n        // an order-sensitive function like RANK.\r\n        if (select.getOrderList() == null) {\r\n          // push ORDER BY into existing select\r\n          select.setOrderBy(orderBy.orderList);\r\n          select.setOffset(orderBy.offset);\r\n          select.setFetch(orderBy.fetch);\r\n          return select;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n When we validate it sencondly ,  in the same method `SqlValidatorImpl.performUnconditionalRewrites`,  the `select.getOrderList()` is not null , and  it finally build a sqlSelect node similar to `select * `, which leads to the excepiton with msg :`Table 'xxx' not found`\r\n\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n1. we can validate for variable `validated` which is the result for first validation and it  is similar to the api `PlannerImpl.validateAndGetType(SqlNode sqlNode)`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.planner.DruidPlanner`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nRunning queries with multiple exact distinct aggregations require us to enable a calcite rule `AggregateExpandDistinctAggregatesRule.INSTANCE` which is currently not enabled. Instead `AggregateExpandDistinctAggregatesRule.JOIN` rule is used which plans queries with multiple distinct aggregations as a Join query with a join condition of type `IS_NOT_DISTINCT_FROM`. However, druid supports only equality conditions in joins. `AggregateExpandDistinctAggregatesRule.INSTANCE` rule, on the other hand, uses grouping aggregator, to run the queries with distinct aggregations. That aggregator was added recently. \r\n\r\nWith `AggregateExpandDistinctAggregatesRule.INSTANCE` enabled, query planning completes just fine however, after planning, the query execution fails. This is due to a bug in how a group by query procures merge buffers. Druid undercounts required merge buffers when there is a nested query and the subquery has subtotals.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the logic to compute required merge buffers. Additionally, a flag has been added to control to switch between old and new behavior. \r\n\r\nThere is still a group of queries that will still fail \r\n - A nested group by query in which subquery has subtotals and the query runs on broker itself. Say merging results need 3 buffers and merging runners need 1 buffer and merge pool size on broker is 3. Query will be accepted since both checks are done independently. But when you run the query, it will block since there are only 2 buffers left for merging results. It's a hypothesis and I haven't verified it via a run. This is an existing behavior and not introduced because of this PR. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nExpands on the structures added in #10613 to add support for grouping on string expressions in the vectorized group by engine. The key addition that makes this possible is `DictionaryBuildingSingleValueStringGroupByVectorColumnSelector`, which is the vectorized group by engine version of `DictionaryBuildingStringGroupByColumnSelectorStrategy`, and allows the vector group by engine to group on strings which are not dictionary encoded.\r\n\r\nTo help showcase this, I added vectorization support to the concat operator `string1 + 'foo'`, and the concat function `concat(string1,'-',string2,'-',long1)`.\r\n\r\nIt provides a pretty decent performance increase. From the added benchmark queries:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      // 26: group by string expr with non-expr agg\r\n      \"SELECT CONCAT(string2, '-', long2), SUM(double1) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\",\r\n      // 27: group by string expr with expr agg\r\n      \"SELECT CONCAT(string2, '-', long2), SUM(long1 * double4) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000        false  avgt    5  1601.424 ± 22.075  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       26           5000000        force  avgt    5  1017.797 ± 18.384  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000        false  avgt    5  2072.850 ± 46.369  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       27           5000000        force  avgt    5  1072.897 ± 19.756  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nVectorizing additional string expressions I will save for a future PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DictionaryBuildingSingleValueStringGroupByVectorColumnSelector`\r\n * `VectorGroupByEngine`\r\n * `GroupByVectorColumnProcessorFactory`\r\n * `VectorStringProcessors`\r\n * `StringOutMultiStringInVectorProcessor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

with segment granularity should skip segments that already have the configured segmentGranularity \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAuto-compaction now supports setting SegmentGranularity. However, it currently submits compaction tasks unnecessary for segments that was compacted (lastCompactionState != null) but lastCompactionState.getGranularitySpec() == null (i.e. compacted when the auto compaction spec does not set SegmentGranularity) and the segments' SegmentGranularity is already the same as the SegmentGranularity configured in the auto compaction spec. This change will make auto compaction checks the existing segments' SegmentGranularity and determine if compaction is needed or not even when SegmentGranularity is not stored in lastCompactionState.\r\n\r\nNote that, with this change, we actually never need to check SegmentGranularity in lastCompactionState to determine if segments need compaction or not. However, I still keep that check there for the following reasons:\r\n1) If lastCompactionState has SegmentGranularity, then it is faster to check and compare using that.\r\n2) If we add support for queryGranularity, we will need to check it in lastCompactionState\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#11007 .\r\n\r\nAfter hooking up Yourkit against the broker instance running the queries mentioned in the above issue, it turns out that a lot of time is being spent in resizing HashMap and HashSet

Description\r\nThis PR specializes `LongDeserializer` implementations with `getDelta` and `getTable` methods to push down unpacking bits, delta encoding adjustment, and table lookups for vectors of data as far as possible and work more efficiently with vectorized query engines, primarily focusing on contiguous reads.\r\n\r\nIt works by unrolling value reads to line up with `ByteBuffer` get methods to eliminate overlapping reads where possible, reading blocks of 8 values at a time for un-aligned values (1, 2, 4, 12, 20, 24, 40, 48, 56). `ByteBuffer` aligned bit-packing widths (8, 16, 32, 64) actually performed worse when this same unrolling was performed, so instead they utilize a traditional for loop with the aligned get methods.\r\n\r\nMost of the improvement is on the small end since it has the most redundant/overlapping memory accesses, but is pretty decent improvement there.\r\n\r\n### Full column scans before/after on uniform distribution columns of varying bits to cover the entire set of value decoders\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                                                           (distribution)  (encoding)  (filteredRowCountPercentage)

simulated filters (up to full scan) \r\nFor the top line graph, the x axis is percent of rows selected by column scan (offset analog) and goes up to 1.0/contiguous scan. The y axis is the amount of time it took to select that many values. The numbers are kind of noisy because i didn't spend the multiple days necessary to do it proper, but it gives a decent idea. Nearly all of the improvement is on the full scan end of the spectrum (last datapoint), because the underlying `BitmapVectorOffset` will never call the contiguous vectorized get methods (which I will fix in a follow-up PR) and the contiguous gets were the primary area of improvement in this PR. The bottom bar chart is the size of the column in bytes as it would be stored in a segment (encoded and/or compressed).\r\n\r\n![before-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/111410582-3d80ce00-8696-11eb-8f6c-c57230ba0849.gif)\r\n\r\nIn a follow-up PR i will probably argue for making this the default long encoding since it does pretty well with the vectorized engine, compared to lz4 longs.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Unpacking\r\nI uh, drew pictures to help me get the shifts and masking correct, so I'll add them here in case they are any help to reviewers. Imagine each diagram for the bit width is the number of values to unpack (8) per loop, where each color is a separate value, and each box is 4 bits.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1058\" alt=\"PNG image-9F52520DEE1D-1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/111421585-7d51b080-86aa-11eb-8360-933e60274e3c.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1036\" alt=\"PNG image-BA4F111C2B53-1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/111421614-86db1880-86aa-11eb-9651-cc750878125a.png\">\r\n<img width=\"958\" alt=\"PNG image-F37823656142-1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/111421645-94909e00-86aa-11eb-9127-8f37c403e727.png\">\r\n<img width=\"974\" alt=\"PNG image-8754DDE6B474-1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/111421668-9ce8d900-86aa-11eb-963f-79b5521ab92e.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1022\" alt=\"PNG image-D07C1140D960-1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1577461/111421682-a3775080-86aa-11eb-85d2-e84ab0e12885.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis feature allows S3 ingestion to use the AssumeRole capability of AWS that helps with cross-account access.\r\nIt introduces 2 additional fields in S3InputSourceConfig (those are optional).\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nDruid can parse the same expressions over again while it explores the search space of candidate plans. This PR adds caching parsed expressions per query. This could also be useful when the search space is large. Caching is disabled by default.\r\n\r\n`SqlBenchmark.planSql()` results after applying this and https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11041. Only the query 19 (the giant union query) shows a noticeable improvement (total ~25%, ~7% for only caching). However, in my testing after I quadrupled the query 19, the gain in planning time was smaller (~11%) than with the original query. This was because of too many candidate plans to explore. I think parallelizing query planning can help in this case, but didn't investigate that idea much because it should be done in Calcite.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster\r\n\r\nBenchmark             (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        0                 5        false  avgt   15    0.563 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        1                 5        false  avgt   15    0.603 ± 0.004  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        2                 5        false  avgt   15    0.662 ± 0.007  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        3                 5        false  avgt   15    0.808 ± 0.009  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        4                 5        false  avgt   15    1.156 ± 0.014  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        5                 5        false  avgt   15    1.291 ± 0.011  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        6                 5        false  avgt   15    1.504 ± 0.011  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        7                 5        false  avgt   15    1.270 ± 0.013  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        8                 5        false  avgt   15    2.044 ± 0.013  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        9                 5        false  avgt   15    1.982 ± 0.022  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       10                 5        false  avgt   15    0.707 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       11                 5        false  avgt   15    0.741 ± 0.002  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       12                 5        false  avgt   15    0.624 ± 0.006  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       13                 5        false  avgt   15    0.874 ± 0.007  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       14                 5        false  avgt   15    0.980 ± 0.008  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       15                 5        false  avgt   15    0.628 ± 0.007  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       16                 5        false  avgt   15    0.745 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       17                 5        false  avgt   15    0.956 ± 0.009  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       18                 5        false  avgt   15    1.078 ± 0.011  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       19                 5        false  avgt   15  129.221 ± 0.725  ms/op\r\n\r\npatch\r\n\r\nBenchmark             (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        0                 5        false  avgt   15   0.541 ± 0.003  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        1                 5        false  avgt   15   0.608 ± 0.004  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        2                 5        false  avgt   15   0.650 ± 0.003  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        3                 5        false  avgt   15   0.700 ± 0.008  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        4                 5        false  avgt   15   1.131 ± 0.007  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        5                 5        false  avgt   15   1.121 ± 0.004  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        6                 5        false  avgt   15   1.315 ± 0.015  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        7                 5        false  avgt   15   1.166 ± 0.011  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        8                 5        false  avgt   15   1.769 ± 0.014  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql        9                 5        false  avgt   15   1.587 ± 0.017  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       10                 5        false  avgt   15   0.710 ± 0.003  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       11                 5        false  avgt   15   0.732 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       12                 5        false  avgt   15   0.584 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       13                 5        false  avgt   15   0.801 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       14                 5        false  avgt   15   0.894 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       15                 5        false  avgt   15   0.583 ± 0.007  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       16                 5        false  avgt   15   0.691 ± 0.003  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       17                 5        false  avgt   15   0.820 ± 0.005  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       18                 5        false  avgt   15   0.937 ± 0.007  ms/op\r\nSqlBenchmark.planSql       19                 5        false  avgt   15  97.453 ± 0.540  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CachingExprParser`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR fixes #10945\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n/druid/v2 endpoint supports jackson smile encoding both for request and response. But there's a bug there when processing a request with 'Accept:application/x-jackson-smile' header.\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation takes 'Accept' parameter, which indicates server that smile encoding is accepted by client to decode the HTTP response, to decode a JSON request. According to HTTP protocol on 'Content-Type' and 'Accept', server should alway decode the body according to 'Content-Type' header, while encode response by 'Accept' header( if not provided, 'Accept' defaults to 'Content-Type')\r\n\r\nThe reason why current unit tests fails to detect this bug is because test cases in `QueryResourceTest` wrongly inject a Json ObjectMapper instead of Smile ObjectMapper for Smile decoding. All related test cases are fixed in this PR too.\r\n\r\n### Smile encoding test\r\n\r\nI have never heard of Smile encoding before, and there's little doc in Druid to describe if we should exploit it. So I also make some investigation how it saves response sizes in Druid to see if this feature could be used in our environment.\r\n\r\n### Test data\r\n\r\nWikipedia data shipped by Druid\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nSending following scan query by CURL with following parameters\r\n- `limit` parameter range in [100,200,300,400,500]\r\n- Accept:application/x-jackson-smile turned on and off\r\n- Content-Encoding:gzip turned on and off\r\n\r\nobserve 'size_download' for each response outputted by CURL \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\": \"scan\",\r\n  \"dataSource\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"table\",\r\n    \"name\": \"wikipedia\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"intervals\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"intervals\",\r\n    \"intervals\": [\r\n      \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"virtualColumns\": [],\r\n  \"batchSize\": 20480,\r\n  \"limit\": 100,\r\n  \"legacy\": false,\r\n  \"descending\": false,\r\n  \"granularity\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"all\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Result\r\n\r\nLimit |Response Bytes in JSON(GZip) | Response Bytes in JSON(No-GZip) | Response Bytes in Smile(GZip) | Response Bytes in Smile(No-GZip)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n100 | 6753 | 43084 | 6550 | 17874\r\n200 | 12485 | 86427 | 11646 | 35781\r\n300 | 18879 | 129798 | 17316 | 53797\r\n400 | 24494 | 172290 | 22208 | 70896\r\n500 | 30886 | 215331 | 27920 | 88595\r\n\r\nThe tests above do not cover all queries in druid, but the data in the table generally reflects advantages of Smile encoding in one aspect.\r\n\r\nFrom the table we can see that:\r\n- when gzip is not enabled in response, Smile encoding(column 5) takes about only 41% space over JSON(column 3)\r\n- when gzip is enabled, Smile encoding performs a little improvement(column 4 vs columns 2)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to gzip which requires more resources on server side, Smile saves serialization time compared to JSON according to [some tests](http://www.theotherian.com/2013/12/kryo-vs-smile-vs-json-shootout-part-1.html). And there's no too much work to do expect replacing default object mapper to smile object mapper which usually is one line of work in many dependency injection system, I think Smile encoding is worthy to try.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nSQL endpoint does not support Smile encoding yet(#10931), this PR does not add Smile encoding to SQL endpoint. I think we could have a discussion. Based on the tests shown above, IMO, it's reasonable to provide such support because SQL query is more popular than native query, at least in our environment.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ResourceIOWriter` is extracted from `ResourceIOReaderWriter` to hold response content-type and right ObjectMapper while original ResourceIOReaderWriter holds right ObjectMapper to deserialize input request.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

repository which points to https://archive.apache.org/\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n\r\nAdded `ARG` instructions to the following dockerfiles `examples/quickstart/tutorial/hadoop/docker/Dockerfile` and `integration-tests/docker/Dockerfile`, changed `integration-tests/docker/base-setup.sh` to support `APACHE_ARCHIVE_MIRROR_HOST` variable and added optional `--build-arg` arguments to `integration-tests/script/docker_build_containers.sh`\r\n\r\nAdded a tip in documentation: `integration-tests/README.md` about how to override `archive.apache.org`\r\n\r\n`archive.apache.org` host is

Kinesis should not increment throwAway count on EOS record\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDruid writes a record with the sequence number \"EOS\" to Kinesis stream when Kinesis stream is re-shard (i.e. number of shard increased). Druid then consume this record (with the sequence number \"EOS\") and see that it is empty and increment the \"throwAway\" count. We should not increment the \"throwAway\" count as the record was generated by Druid and incrementing the \"throwAway\" count makes it very difficult to determine if any data was actually lost during a resharding event.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the constructor of `TopNQuery` class. \r\n\r\nIn the constructor, `dimensionSpec` is accessed to construct `postAggregatorSpecs` object before the null check of itself, which results in NPE. \r\nThis PR fixes this bug by moving all argument checking code to the begin of the constructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where during SQL planning we optimize the time filter to false or some combination of all false filters in an \"and\" or \"or\" filter, resulting in the filtration for the query in the planner making a `GroupByQuery` with an empty interval, but this explodes in the constructor because `computeUniversalTimestamp` doesn't handle this case and expects there to be a start timestamp.

#6942\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis might look like a large PR but most changes are mechanical i.e. updates to import statements and guava dependency in various pom files.\r\n\r\nHere is the meaty part...\r\n\r\n1.  A new module \"shaded-guava\" is introduced that produces classes in \"org.apache.druid.com.google.common\" package by shading real guava. See `shaded-guava/pom.xml` . \r\n2.  pom.xml in all modules are made to depend upon shaded guava jar above instead of real guava, that change looks like\r\n```\r\n-      <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>\r\n+      <groupId>org.apache.druid.com.google.guava</groupId>\r\n```\r\n3. In all Java files, `import com.google.common.X` is replaced by `import org.apache.druid.com.google.guava.X`\r\n4.  \"Organize Imports\" is done to all Java files to correct import ordering or checkstyles fails\r\n5. Some imports in `cloudfiles-extensions` and `sql` modules are reverted to use `import com.google.common.X` because their dependencies `jclouds-core` and `calcite` respectively mandate using real `import com.google.common.X` in various methods exposed by those libraries. But this is minimal.\r\n6. some imports that used `org.apache.curator.shaded.com.google.common.X` , i.e. shaded version of guava used by curator, continue to use same. that is independent.\r\n\r\n(this approach was briefly described in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/6942#issuecomment-791029487 )\r\n\r\nEnd Result is that Druid source code is free from real guava and can use any version of guava inside `shaded-guava` module, few exceptions in (5) as described above.\r\nwe still ship guava-0.16.1.jar like before, so no external integrations should see any impact. User should be able to switch this with their favorite version of guava jar at runtime and Druid source code be fine because it uses druid-shaded-guava-0.x.y.jar \r\n\r\nExisting Unit, Integration Tests and Travis builds should cover all of the changes except for Hadoop Integration that I could not verify due to not having quick access to such setup. However, given the way this patch works and that we continue to ship existing guava jar, Hadoop Integration should see no change.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10965 should also be done after this PR is accepted.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
