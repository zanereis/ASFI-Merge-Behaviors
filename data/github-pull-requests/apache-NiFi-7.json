Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13560](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13560) Refactors Parameter Provider handling to avoid storing fetched Parameter Values in the persisted flow configuration.\r\n\r\nThe implementation change retains memory-based storage of fetched Parameter Values ,but stores a reference string in the serialized flow configuration. When the framework starts, the flow synchronization process fetches current values from referenced Parameter Providers.\r\n\r\nThis change requires configured Parameter Provider services to be accessible on startup, but otherwise retains existing behavior. This strategy restores centralized management of external Parameter Values to referenced external services. The nature of external vaults and secrets managers necessitates high availability, so the requirement for accessibility on application start should be reasonable for production deployments.\r\n\r\n#

Before this fix whether a user specified  `MM` or `M` only double digit months could be read. That logic was incorrect as the underlying code uses  `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` and per the [DateTimeFormatter javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html) specifying single digit month `M` should support both single and double digits.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13558](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13558) Updates the framework `WebSecurityConfiguration` to ignore requests that do not require authentication.\r\n\r\nThe previous approach applied Spring Security filter processing to all requests, but permitted access without authentication to specific paths required for user interface configuration. This approach works for the majority of situations where the user interface makes initial requests without authentication. For certain edge cases, the client browser will continue to send a session cookie with an application bearer token that may be expired. In this situation, unauthenticated paths should continue to return the same results.\r\n\r\nThe implementation changes make use of the [securityMatchers](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html#security-matchers) method to specify the paths that the filter chain evaluates. The configuration updates apply filter evaluation to all requests, except those listed as unfiltered paths.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

This PR is to have it added to the 1.x branch. Per the comments in [NIFI-11167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-11167)  and [NIFI-13304](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13304) it would seem this feature along with `SplitExcel` processor will help customers who had used `ConvertExcelToCSV` in 1.x be able to make a smoother transition from 1.x to  2.x.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13494](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13494) Removes support for repository encryption in framework repository implementations.\r\n\r\nAs described in the associated Jira issue, the current repository encryption implementation has several structural issues, including the use of Java Object serialization for metadata, encryption key storage on the file system, and key reuse concerns with AES for large data volumes. Solutions based on operating system support for full-disk encryption, or cloud provider support for volume encryption with externalized keys provide robust alternatives. \r\n\r\nChanges include removing the `nifi-security-kms` module and the `nifi-repository-encryption` module, as well as removing implementation classes in framework modules.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13493](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13493) Removes the dependency-check automated GitHub workflow to avoid repeated failures following changes in version 9 of the plugin. The OWASP Dependency Check plugin supports a configurable API Key for the NVD database, but without the key, database downloading has significant rate limits. The automated workflow could be reintroduced after evaluating a caching strategy and potential registration of a project-based NVD API Key. The dependency-check profile remains available for local evaluation.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13476](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13476) Optimizes authorization checking when computing Process Group Status. Changes include evaluating the current recursion depth for included component status and using that to decide whether to run full authorization checks or use a static denied response. For flow definitions with several process groups that have numbers of nested components, this improvement avoids numerous unnecessary calls to the configured Authorizer.\r\n\r\n#

This covers the \"push model\" described in the [Feature Proposal for Custom NAR Improvements](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Custom+NAR+Improvements).\r\n\r\nThe REST API introduced includes the following end-points:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUpload a NAR:\r\nPOST - /controller/nar-manager/upload (application/octet-stream)\r\n\r\nList uploaded NARs:\r\nGET -  /controller/nar-manager/nars\r\n\r\nGet summary for a single NAR:\r\nGET -  /controller/nar-manager/nars/{id}\r\n\r\nGet more details for a single NAR like the extensions contained in it:\r\nGET -  /controller/nar-manager/nars/{id}/detalls\r\n\r\nDownload a NAR:\r\nGET -  /controller/nar-manager/nars/{id}/download\r\n\r\nDelete a previously uploaded NAR:\r\nDELETE -  /controller/nar-manager/nars/{id}\r\n```\r\nSome rules and restrictions of the current functionality...\r\n\r\nIf you upload a NAR with the same coordinate, it will replace the existing NAR, which includes:\r\n- Stopping and ghosting any components instantiated from the NAR\r\n- Unloading the previous NAR\r\n- Loading the new NAR\r\n- Unghosting the previously ghosted components\r\n- Restoring the components state if needed\r\n\r\nYou can upload NARs in any order and if a NAR is missing it's dependency it will remain unloaded in a \"Missing Dependency\" state until the dependency is uploaded, at which it automatically becomes loaded/installed. Similar to how dropping NARs into `./extensions` works.\r\n\r\nYou can't upload a NAR with the same coordinate as a NAR that is not part of the \"NAR Manager\", meaning one of the NARs that was provided from a lib directory or a NarProvider. \r\n\r\nOn delete, the `force` argument can be passed which will stop and ghost any components to allow delete to proceed. \r\n\r\nOne other restriction is not being allowed to delete or replace a NAR that another NAR has a dependency on.\r\n\r\nIn a cluster, when a node joins the cluster it attempts to synchronize its NARs with the coordinator. This requires access to the REST APIs described above, which means the node identities will need READ on `/controller`.\r\n\r\nCLI commands are implemented for all of the above end-points:\r\n```\r\n#> nifi upload-nar -nar nifi-example-processors-nar-1.0.nar\r\n#> nifi upload-nar -nar nifi-example-service-api-nar-1.0.nar\r\n#> nifi upload-nar -nar nifi-example-service-nar-1.1.nar\r\n\r\n#> nifi list-nars\r\n\r\n#   Id                                     Group             Artifact                       Version   State\r\n-   ------------------------------------   ---------------   ----------------------------   -------   ---------\r\n1   1c6575c8-e488-33d3-a226-7803bfc30004   org.apache.nifi   nifi-example-processors-nar    1.0       Installed\r\n2   afd8c799-de79-33ad-9ad0-413bd5beff3b   org.apache.nifi   nifi-example-service-api-nar   1.0       Installed\r\n3   5f63686a-b59f-30f6-ad2b-9b372678398e   org.apache.nifi   nifi-example-service-nar       1.1       Installed\r\n\r\n#> nifi list-nar-component-types -nid 1c6575c8-e488-33d3-a226-7803bfc30004\r\n\r\n#   Type                                             Kind\r\n-   ----------------------------------------------   ---------\r\n1   org.apache.nifi.processors.example.MyProcessor   PROCESSOR\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [ ] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [XX] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nThere are two system tests that exercise the APIs, one in a standalone instance, and and one with a two node cluster to exercise the replication of uploads.\r\n\r\nIn addition, have been running a two node cluster locally and testing various API calls and scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.
