management .deb package to roughly half the size\n- Reduce common .rpm package to roughly half the size\n- Transparent support for more distros like Fedora 21\n- Reduced dependencies on the packages, such as mysql-connector-java which are now bundled\n- Upgraded Jetty version used by Travis from oldie and discontinued morbay 6.x version to current eclipse 9.x version\n- Tidy up debian packaging under /packaging and include support on package.sh\n- Cleanup of a lot of duplicate files which made it harder to maintain and caused some fixes to be implemented only for some distros\n- Consolidates a few configs that were different across distros and shouldn't be\n- Enables running with any version of openjdk runtime and compiling with any version of openjdk devel as long as they meet the minimum requirements (Java 7+) without conflicting with other packages.\n\nThe package.sh script packages ASF Tomcat by default, you can package it with Jetty instead by passing -j or --jetty :)\n\nThere's still a couple more things to consolidate and a couple more places to remove hardcoding of configs like the cloud user, but i'll take care of that on a later PR :)\n","created_at":"2015-06-08T17:18:13Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T09:42:58Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T09:07:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9110de004060ad5b1ef919d7990c3ae46709ca3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/decde6d129ce8c87a82d8aa00a6723b91c322e02","head":{"label":"rsafonseca:fixpackaging2","ref":"fixpackaging2","sha":"decde6d129ce8c87a82d8aa00a6723b91c322e02","user":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34946700,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk0NjcwMA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"rsafonseca/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rsafonseca","id":12141667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQxNjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12141667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca","html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsafonseca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rsafonseca/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

test in the test suite is checking that when the hosts are in maintenance state, then VPC created with start=False parameter should be in inactive state. However, this is incorrect.\n\nVPC is in inactive state only after it is deleted. Hence the state of the VPC created when the hosts are in maintenance state is Enabled only.\n\nFurther, the VPC won't be deleted by any cleanup threads because it is in enabled state and not in inactive state. Remove the test case which asserts that VPC should be removed after cleanup interval.\n\nOther changes:\nRemoved hard-coded services dict from the test case. Instead the test case will use the dict located at /marvin/config/test_data.py which is common for all test cases.\n\nLogs:\nTest VPC when host is in maintenance mode ... === TestName:

Commit Message\n\nPropertiesUtil has code for reading from jar files, but the\nfindConfigFile method will prevent it from ever returning a file in a\njar on the classpath since it always wants to have a \"file:\" URL and\nuse the File class.\n\nThis commit moves the jar file loading attempt from a catch block to\nan else clause, executed if a config file:// URL could not be found.\n## Tests Performed\n\nMoved API commands from commands.properties to a file in a jar and started up the simulator. Verified that all 479 synced when running the sync command.\n","created_at":"2015-06-04T17:02:52Z","updated_at":"2015-06-08T09:58:54Z","closed_at":"2015-06-08T07:19:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2fc8b5c855eead4887b5dc16d1d9acd2be6b37e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/ad37446a7b3c241686f6cd3e7af5fc3414fda7dd","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-read-properties-from-jars","ref":"pr-read-properties-from-jars","sha":"ad37446a7b3c241686f6cd3e7af5fc3414fda7dd","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"93845afd53fea7f9b9d95e995478054f823aa8b8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

issues: 1012719, 1116509, 1116677 and 1116812\n\nI split commit between fixes and code formatting in order to keep the review as smooth as possible.\n\nThe fixes include:\n- Commenting out an unused variable in the Test.java\n- Assigning the ResultSet returned by the prepared statement and closing it in the finally block\n- Avoiding catching only Exception. Makes the code too britle.\n- Catching the QemuImgException and throwing it to be caught further in the code\n- Surrounding the output stream with try/catch and throwing it to be further handled in the code. Closing the output stream quietly.\n- Replacing concatenation with optionsBuffer.append(option.getKey()).append('=').append(option.getValue()).append(',');\n\nFull build, including tests, was executed. I will deploy a DC and run VM Life Cycle on KVM and XenServer62. Report will follow.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","created_at":"2015-06-04T07:34:29Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T10:34:35Z","closed_at":"2015-06-04T10:34:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c86c29d35c9d83b98c60e50b1d5ed35cc1e09b94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/6dc8bcc9b62793ce3c313496eedbf9025bc20e42","head":{"label":"schubergphilis:fix/coverity_issues","ref":"fix/coverity_issues","sha":"6dc8bcc9b62793ce3c313496eedbf9025bc20e42","user":{"login":"schubergphilis","id":864482,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg2NDQ4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/864482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis","html_url":"https://github.com/schubergphilis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f92a50363c74ba699dc678489ed75624a2ac75a1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Commit Message\n\nThis commit has a small refactoring of cloud-plugin-acl-static-role-based\nto allow it to read files on the classpath that might have a different name\nthan \"commands.properties\". It also allows more than one file to be read from.\n\nRationale: Third-party plugins may want to keep their API command access level\nconfiguration separate from the main file so as to reduce configuration\nmaintenance work during packaging and deployments.\n## Testing Performed\n\nRan the simulator locally and connected to it with Cloudmonkey. Ran sync and then executed some API commands to verify that they are not blacklisted (i.e. not found because CS could not read the file on the classpath).\n","created_at":"2015-06-03T17:35:25Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T07:24:12Z","closed_at":"2015-07-01T12:46:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38c252fcdf1fb0247a6742ff8a7dcfb4f1183aaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c59a4a73b7405ef96dc56e59717803a9a62f1765","head":{"label":"greenqloud:master-gq","ref":"master-gq","sha":"c59a4a73b7405ef96dc56e59717803a9a62f1765","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c0bf00c568531dc21c409649e9089244b8ff0e78","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache
