the `ScalarToTensorConstants` pass only runs on functions with the \"cmsis-nn\" compiler attribute. Previously, it was possible for parts of the pass to run on all of the input. For example, `ReplaceScalarWithTensorVariable` was running on all OpNodes without regard to the containing function. As a result, this change means that the pass now visits each CMSIS-NN function separately, rather than visiting the body of the main

is the C++ code for running Hexagon code on simulator via the RPC mechanism.

Scope of this PR\r\n\r\nBelow, I outline a design for representing virtual devices in tree. This PR only implements a small part of the design below-- it changes the representation of the virtual devices for function parameters and is relatively straightforward. However, I do change the syntax through which the function parameter virtual device is specified, and I designed the change to be consistent with what I want to do for let-bound variables in the future. I have provided this document because it provides important context for this PR.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, users can write virtual devices into the program by specifying the `function_result_virtual_device`, and the `function_param_virtual_devices` in the function attributes. Users can also introduce annotations using the `on_device` op, mostly on function arguments, but sometimes on let-bound variables. \r\n\r\nDevice planning solves the constraints created by the user-specified virtual devices— for each sub-expression, it determines a unique and consistent virtual device. We’ll call this the **complete representation.**\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, function parameter virtual devices and the function result virtual device is represented through attributes on the function. Since there is already a text format for attributes on functions, we can represent the function parameter virtual devices and the function result virtual device in the text format by just putting them in the attributes— we get the text representation automatically. \r\n\r\nHowever, once we move the function virtual devices out of the attributes, we no longer get the text representation for free. The most immediate challenge is that the unit tests for the device planner are written in RelayScript— so without rethinking the text format for virtual devices, we can’t run the unit tests. \r\n\r\nA second motivation is that the current text representation is clunky— for the user to specify the virtual device of a subexpr, they need to wrap that expression in an `on_device` op. In the current implementation, let-bound variables and also arguments to functions must be wrapped in `on_device` . While I am rethinking the text format, I’d like to rethink this as well. \r\n\r\n# Goal\r\n\r\nThe goal for the text representation is a RelayScript program that preserves all virtual device information from device planning in a **minimal representation**. The minimal representation is the least amount of information (subexprs assigned virtual devices) we need to reconstruct the device planned program using simple lexical scoping rules. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I want to be able to reconstruct the **complete representation** from the **minimal representation** without using device planning itself. This will let us express the expected result of running PlanDevices in RelayScript without running PlanDevices itself. \r\n\r\n# Proposed design\r\n\r\nIn general, I propose removing the `on_device` op from the RelayScript representation, and simplifying the way function virtual devices are represented in text. I will\r\n\r\n1) formalize the minimal representation\r\n\r\n2) introduce syntax for the critical virtual devices\r\n\r\n3)  introduce a pass that uses simple, lexical scoping rules to expand the minimal representation into the complete representation\r\n\r\n## The minimal representation of device planning information\r\n\r\nThe current text format for representing the device planned program in RelayScript preserves the virtual devices for\r\n\r\n1) function parameters and the function result\r\n\r\n2) arguments to functions if the argument device is different from the function result device\r\n\r\n3) let-bound variables\r\n\r\n4) inputs to `device_copy`\r\n\r\nFor our minimal representation, we don’t need 4, since the virtual devices of the inputs of `device_copy` must agree with the virtual devices specified in the `device_copy` op itself.\r\n\r\nIn this example from the current text representation, the virtual device specified in `%1`  is the same as the source virtual device in `%2`. We can remove the `on_device` op and not lose any information.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef @main(%x: Tensor[(5, 7), float32], %y: Tensor[(5, 7), float32], %z: Tensor[(5, 7), float32],\r\n          param_virtual_devices=[meta[VirtualDevice][1], meta[VirtualDevice][1], meta[VirtualDevice][0]],\r\n          result_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][0]) {\r\n     %0 = add(%x, %y);\r\n     %1 = on_device(%0, virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][1], constrain_result=True);\r\n     %2 = device_copy(%1, src_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][1], dst_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][0]);\r\n     subtract(%2, %z)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, we’ll define our minimal representation to consist of:\r\n\r\n1. The virtual devices of variable bindings (namely, function parameters and let-bound variables)\r\n2. The virtual device of function results\r\n\r\nWe’ll call these the **critical virtual devices.**\r\n\r\n## Syntax for the critical virtual devices\r\n\r\nPiggy-backing off the current text representation, we’d like to represent the virtual devices for let-bound variables and function parameters directly after the variable definition in a structure that looks like attributes. \r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef @main(%x {virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][0]}: Tensor[(3, 3, 4)], float32],\r\n          virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][1] /* result virtual device*/) {\r\n    %0 = split(%x, indices_or_sections=3);\r\n    let %t {virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][0]} = %0;\r\n    %2 = %t.1;\r\n    %3 = device_copy(%1, src_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][0], dst_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][1]);\r\n    %4 = device_copy(%2, src_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][0], dst_virtual_device=meta[VirtualDevice][1]);\r\n\t  subtract(%3, %4)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function result virtual device is represented directly in the function’s attributes, just like in the current implementation. We are still using the `meta` syntax to represent the value of the virtual device function. In the parser, we’ll “promote” the function’s `virtual_device` attribute to first-class by setting the `virtual_device_` field of the function. We won’t put the virtual device in the attributes of the function.\r\n\r\nFor variable definitions, the virtual device will be represented directly after the type annotation of the variable in text that looks like attributes. We won’t actually add attributes to variable definitions. However, by using the same syntax as attributes, we can reuse the utilities in the parser for parsing attributes to parse the virtual device. (If there are fields other than `virtual_device` in the fake attributes, the parser will fail). An advantage to this approach is that if we do want to add attributes to bound variables in the future, we don’t need to change our syntax at all. \r\n\r\n## Expansion of minimal representation / propagation of ‘critical’ virtual devices\r\n\r\nWe’ll introduce a new pass, called DPL (”device plan lite”), which propagates the ‘critical’ virtual devices and `device_copy` virtual devices so that every subexpr’s `virtual_device_` field is populated. This pass will follow simple lexical propagation rules; if it finds a ‘critical’ virtual device that is not set, it will fail. \r\n\r\nNote that in the current implementation, the minimal representation is not expanded into the complete representation at all— rather, during traversal in the DeviceAwareVisitExpr, the visitor keeps track of what the current virtual device is using simple lexical scoping rules. Every time you traverse the program, you must recompute the virtual devices of all the subexpressions. With DPL, we only have to do the propagation once, and we can get rid of DeviceAwareVisitExpr completely.\r\n\r\n## Implied virtual device rules\r\n\r\nThe DPL pass will rely on some implied rules to properly flow device planning information, most importantly\r\n\r\n1) The virtual device of an argument to a function is the same as the virtual device of a function parameter\r\n\r\n2) Call ops are either literals, globals and possibly let-bound variables\r\n\r\nNote that for number 1, the user will need to insert a device copy op around function arguments whose virtual device is different than the corresponding function parameter’s virtual device. Also note that for number 2, if we have a call to something other than a literal, global or let-bound variable, we will need to re-run device planning completely since DPL won’t be able to reconstruct the complete representation.\r\n\r\n## Tests in device planning\r\n\r\nThe test cases will use the new Relay Script syntax and the DPL pass to test device planning.\r\n\r\nLet `input` be the input program (in text format), containing `on_device` ops and `device_copy` ops, and `expected` be our expected output program (in text format), which has the virtual device information for every ‘critical’ virtual device.\r\n\r\nThen, let  `complete_output = DP(parse(input))` , where `complete_output` is a fully device planned program with all the `virtual_device_` fields propagated (the complete representation).\r\n\r\nNow, let `minimal_expected = parse(expected)` be the minimal representation of the fully device planned program. `minimal_expected` doesn’t have all the `virtual_device_` fields propagated, but it does contain enough information to completely reconstruct the device planned program through simple lexical rules. We then use DPL (”device plan lite”) to recreate the original program.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can check that `complete_output == DPL(minimal_expected)`. It is also true that `parse(print(complete_output)) == minimal_expected`.\r\n\r\nNote that the DPL pass will also be useful for reconstructing any virtual device information that is removed or not propagated correctly by some other Relay pass. We expect that this may occasionally happen. As long as the ‘critical’ virtual devices are preserved, we can run DPL to get the complete

LoopPartition has a limitation that the intersection of all conditions on var can not be none. In fact we can partition the loop when the intersection of all conditions on var is none in some cases.

T.load(\"int8\", placeholder_2.data, i1 * 784 + i2 * 28 + i3 - 75264),\r\n                    True,\r\n                )\r\n            if 64 <= i1 and i1 < 96:\r\n                T.store(\r\n

found this while converting an RNN model.\r\n\r\nThe relay tflite frontend use squeeze at converting unpack, but when the\r\nunpack.axis=0, `None` is passed to relay.squeeze(), which would squeeze\r\nall dimensions with length 1, causing different results from TFLite.\r\n\r\nA possible fix might be, assign the unpack.axis as-is to relay.squeeze()\r\n\r\nAs for stridedslice, when the tflite frontend handles shrink_axis_mask,\r\nthe wrapped `begin` should be used, instead of the original one which\r\ncan be negative. It can cause errors at\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/d65ff6594d4d6db0062537a1d43c0504173b8e5c/include/tvm/topi/detail/strided_slice.h#L140\r\n\r\nRelated cases are also added to the python test.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10230, I added VNNI support for `batch_matmul` as well. The cool part is that I reuse the same `dense` schedule in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10230 to schedule the GEMM part, and parallelize over the batch dimension.  See the perf result in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10332#issuecomment-1047304225\r\n\r\n~After this PR, I'll add `int8, int8` support to VNNI `dense` and `batch_matmul`~ (UPDATE: Done) - that will allow us to benchmark e2e performance on QAT BERT made possible by @Icemist in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10239.\r\n\r\nUnlike `dense` case, the second input to `batch_matmul` is typically not a constant tensor. So I don't use `alter_layout` and compile time layout transform. Instead, layout transform is done at runtime. So the lowered IR for `batch_matmul` + post ops looks like:\r\n```\r\n  parallel (ax0.ax1.outer.ax2.outer.fused.fused, 0, 128) {\r\n    // attr [T_layout_trans] storage_alignment = 128\r\n    let

PR introduces the support of integer BufferLoadNodes in `arith::IntervalSetEvaluator` as well as a unittest.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the evaluator always return `IntervalSet::Everything()` (that is `[-∞, +∞]`) once it encounters a BufferLoad. However, as long as 1) the buffer data _is of type integer_ and 2) the indices of the BufferLoad _contain no variable_ that needs to be relaxed during evaluation, we can keep the BufferLoad as it is.\r\n\r\nBesides, we're considering introducing `assume_in_range` for buffers for the use of range/region analysis. With `assume_in_range`, even when the indices of BufferLoad contain some variables to be relaxed, we can just return the asserted range, which is more compact, instead of the universe.\r\n\r\ncc

@AndrewZhaoLuo @jwfromm \r\n\r\n#9911 introduced some extra broadcasting to handle edge cases in shapes. In cases where the broadcasted shape matched the input shape, this ended up being a null op that caused some issues with a model I've been testing.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is deeper in how

issue where there are two versions of the nRF5340 development kit, 1.0.0 and 2.0.0. The 1.0.0 DK exposes three COM ports, where COM2 is used to communicate with the device while running tests. The 2.0.0 DK only has two COM ports as can be seen here:\r\n```\r\n$ nrfjprog --com\r\n1050063518    /dev/ttyACM0    VCOM0\r\n1050063518    /dev/ttyACM1    VCOM1\r\n```\r\nmicrotvm_api_server.py always uses VCOM2 which doesn't exist on the 2.0.0 DK.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate this, the USB product ID (PID) can be used to differentiate between the 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 DKs. The PID for 1.0.0 is 0x1055, while the PID for the 2.0.0 DK is 0x1051.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #10206\r\n\r\ncc @mehrdadh @areusch

of `set_one_input` method in VirtualMachine (VM) class. It provides more convenient way to work with multiple input models on native side. Now you can use index or name to set one input tensor to VM.\r\nExamples:\r\n`set_one_input(\"main\", \"data\", tensor0)`\r\n`set_one_input(\"main\", 1, tensor1)`\r\nIt was required due to GraphExecutor (GE) and VM have different signature for `set_input` method. `set_input` from VM is not so convenient for work with multiple tensor input. Implemented `set_one_input` method in VM is repeated signature from `set_input` in GE.\r\nI think it will be good if we have the same API for both GraphExecutor and VirtualMachine. But I do not see simple way for it.\r\nMy current solution seems solid but not final.\r\n\r\nPossible improvements: I can insert functionality of `set_one_input` method to base method `set_input`. But I do not think that it is good idea to mix them. Other possible extension is to additionally reload `set_input` with args: func_name, index1(name1), tensor1, index2(name2), tensor2, …, indexN(nameN), tensorN, where N is number of all input tensors. But it is still not perfect solution for me.","created_at":"2022-02-17T18:55:16Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T06:26:16Z","closed_at":"2022-02-25T20:46:01Z","merged_at":"2022-02-25T20:46:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"d62a364ba783afef92623ee531043ee8dbd43566","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/us

PR solves issue 10240. Previous implementation for checking device was little misleading/problematic. It was checking device in almost infinite loop (`while not dev.exist`), but the thread which was doing this was set with timeout. Check status was equivalent to thread state, imho it's incorrect and misleading.\r\n\r\nSo I have changed to more proper way, but with little duplicated code:\r\n1. Still we have almost infinite loop (`while not dev.exist`)\r\n2. After loop finish we do not check thread status, but again check device\r\n3. I have added extra debug logging - leave or remove it - decision for owners of the project
