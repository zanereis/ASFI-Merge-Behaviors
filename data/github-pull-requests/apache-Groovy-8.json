Without this change, a fail within `shell.parse()` within the `try` block leaves the `type` as `null` and then provides that argument to `removeClassCacheEntry()`. At that point no matter what exception `shell.parse()` threw, the `Interpreter.evaluate()` will end up throwing a `NullPointerException` thus masking the error. In our case at TinkerPop, the exception typically masked is a `StackOverflowError` which would be much more useful than the `NullPointerException` as it would point to a common specific problem that we could alert users to more readily.","created_at":"2020-10-14T19:21:28Z","updated_at":"2020-10-20T01:38:38Z","closed_at":"2020-10-20T01:38:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12a43ef768ce0637c8b2f44ee4ad95b9eb60df61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/bf413bd7469391c0fbe4e32cc025a866550a6216","head":{"label":"spmallette:GROOVY_2_5_X","ref":"GROOVY_2_5_X","sha":"bf413bd7469391c0fbe4e32cc025a866550a6216","user":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":303429881,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM0Mjk4ODE=","name":"groovy","full_name":"spmallette/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"spmallette","id":384249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette","html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spmallette/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/spmallette/groovy","description":"Apache

first.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-29T14:45:16Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T11:15:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-09T11:03:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06917bc0bb7acc556b2ce3113298baa523ac229e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/f999653116f865482cd4eb57d921274313577168","head":{"label":"melix:cc/gradle/update-publishing","ref":"cc/gradle/update-publishing","sha":"f999653116f865482cd4eb57d921274313577168","user":{"login":"melix","id":316357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjM1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/316357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix","html_url":"https://github.com/melix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134554157,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQ1NTQxNTc=","name":"groovy","full_name":"melix/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"melix","id":316357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjM1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/316357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix","html_url":"https://github.com/melix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/melix/groovy","description":"Mirror

common with SAM-type coercion.  The code has become quite complex with regards to generics handling.  The errors reported in the issues come from `typeCheckMethodsWithGenericsOrFail`, so this seemed a good place to message argument types since it comes after visiting non-closure arguments and after determining the method call target, which is necessary to know the parameter target for each argument.","created_at":"2020-09-16T21:37:36Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T14:46:18Z","closed_at":"2020-09-20T00:40:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a605302afd014fbbd58ee674c7b0be2d397b742d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/65cdfab35cd249e47c13b40439690208079393b0","head":{"label":"apache:GROOVY-8961","ref":"GROOVY-8961","sha":"65cdfab35cd249e47c13b40439690208079393b0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache
