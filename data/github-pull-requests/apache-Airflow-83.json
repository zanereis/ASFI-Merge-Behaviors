of the recent sqlalchemy changes are not working with minimum version of sqlalchemy of ours - for example `where` syntax does not allow moe than one clause and we are already passing more in _do_delete_old_records (added in #33527). This syntax however was added in SQL Alchemy 1.4.28 and our minimum version was 1.4.27.\r\n\r\nThis change bumps the minimum SQLAlchemy version to 1.4.28 but it also adds a special test job that only runs on Postgres that downgrades the SQLAlchemy to the minimum supported version (retrieved from setup.cfg). This way, we will be able to detect such incompatible changes at the PR time. This is a new flag `--downgrade-sqlalchemy` on test command that works similar to earlier `--upgrade-boto`.\r\n\r\nWe also enable the `--upgrade-boto` and `--downgrade-sqlalchemy` flags to be used for `breeze shell` command - thanks to that we can easily test both flags with `breeze shell` command.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

docker-compose tests are failing occassionally and part of it is that we were manually waiting and querying for the compose to be ready. Since we moved to docker compose v2 only we can now remove the conditional docker-compose v1 code and use `--wait` and `--wait-timetout` built-in functionality and increase the timeout a bit. This should be helpful to avoid a race condition where the docker components are started but not healthy yet, the flag `--wait` waits not only for the processes to start but also for the health checks.\r\n\r\nAlso increased the timeout of waiting for dags to be in terminal state.\r\n\r\nThis should help with stability of the test.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR adjusts the DAG level Params validation to the validation also used during triggering and DAG constructor.\r\n\r\nIt resolves the problem reported in #34227 that params with a value of `None` are leading to invalid/unparsable DAGs after upgrade to Airflow 2.7.1 as a side effect of #33141 - reason is that the validation previously checked for `has_value` assuming that the schema also defines a required field.\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n* See all tests are green\r\n* Define a DAG with the code below and see that with the fix applied, the DAG is parse-able again and can be used:\r\n```\r\n@dag(\r\n    dag_id=\"dag-example\",\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 2, 2, tz=\"America/New_York\"),\r\n    schedule=\"41 2 * * *\",\r\n    params={\r\n        \"any_param\":

reported by @cliebBS in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34183#issuecomment-1711829892, there was an issue where the enum was deserialized as a string, and this crashed the code in the `__init__` method.\r\n\r\nThe second commit fixes this bug.\r\n\r\nBefore working on fixing this bug, I worked on \"improving\" the serialization test that we had to be closer to reality (and to see this bug make the test fail), and merged all serialization tests into one file to make maintenance easier.

This is because logs are not streamed until [the trigger event successfully fires and execute_complete is called](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5744b424f3ddb3efdf5c2607d13e084955907cc8/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/operators/pod.py#L670-L672). What's worse is that we do not know what the pod_name or the pod_namespace is until execute_complete is called as well. With synchronous KPO, this happens [immediately after get_or_create_pod is called](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5744b424f3ddb3efdf5c2607d13e084955907cc8/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/operators/pod.py#L588-L590). We should do the same with the deferrable flow. Therefore, users can add extra_links to the KPO (retrieving pod_name and pod_namespace from xcom) and stream in-flight logs from their monitoring tool of choice (for us, it is Cloud Monitoring because we use GKE).\r\n\r\nThis moves the xcom_push calls up to execute_async. To test, I used this dag and observed xcom appear during deferral state.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.kubernetes_engine import (\r\n

This PR suggests a change to extend that language to encompass the capability to dynamically set operator attributes more generally, and also adds an example DAG for the same.\r\n\r\nConcerns: \r\n\r\n- While useful, this feels like a footgun in a lot of ways. Should there be some warning text along the lines of \"be sure you know what you're doing\"?\r\n- The third case in the example DAG, where a DAG author could impact operator execution across other DAGs, was surprising and somewhat worrisome. Should this pattern be something recommended in official docs while that slight variation could cause chaos in a commonly-used operator?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

This results in the `gcp_conn_id` being ignored and replaced by the default value `google_cloud_default` as can be seen in the following logs.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n[2023-09-07, 19:14:32 UTC]
