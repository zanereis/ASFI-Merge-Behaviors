gauge metrics in portable mode.\r\n\r\nThe `getMonitoringInfos()` wraps the worker side metrics into `MonitoringInfos`, that is later returned to the runner though `ProcessBundleResponse`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `getMonitoringInfos()` only implemented steps for counter and distribution metrics, and missed out the gauge. This PR adds the implementation to support gauge metrics. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

struct was changed in Go 1.20, a new field `Cancel func() error` [had been added](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.20:src/os/exec/exec.go;drc=ea4631cc0cf301c824bd665a7980c13289ab5c9d;l=259) to it.\r\n\r\nThe `Test_getRunOrTestCmd` test relies on comparing two instances of `exec.Cmd` using `reflect.DeepEqual()`. Deep equality of structs is performed by doing deep equality checks on all of their members. Deep equality of `Func` values is [defined](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.20:src/reflect/deepequal.go;drc=ee0e40aaef3dc5c6fb8612dd80622e02fc4b574f;l=153) as `false` for all non-`nil` values. Because of this the test is failing on Go 1.20, as even two equivalent instances of `exec.Cmd` struct are no longer deeply equal due to the new `Cancel` field of type `func()`, because, as defined above, two non-`nil` functions are always not deeply equal.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the deep comparison with string comparison of the generated command line, as it's the intention of the test.\r\n\r\nresolves #25380\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

logic to create metadata table if it doesn't exist. The metadata table is used to communicate between DetectNewPartitions and ReadChangeStreamPartition stages in the connector. The table includes information regarding currently streaming partitions as well as new splits and merges of partitions.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes references to custom artifact registry of Cloud Bigtable Java Client that includes the new Change Stream API. We are still waiting for the API to merge and make its way to the latest version of Google Cloud BOM. So, in parallel, we will incrementally review and submit changes to a feature branch. Once the beam repo is updated to include the Cloud Bigtable's new API, we will remove all the code in `gradle.build` file before merging into master.\r\n\r\nWe will remove all the dependencies and plugins aded in `sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/build.gradle`, except for the emulator which will be needed for all unit tests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[25318](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/25318), allows one to set a create disposition when writing to BigQuery so that the user can control whether a table should be created or not. I tried to make the changes backwards-compatible. \r\n\r\nI'm a newbie to Go and beam, so I was hoping for some guidance around testing. I wasn't quite sure if it was worth creating a unit test for this small logic, or perhaps whether I should create some sort of integration test to see whether a pipeline integrates correctly with bigquery. Any suggestions would be most welcome! \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

small simplification ... removing RDD caching for the Spark Dataset runner.\r\n\r\nWith the recent RDD linage fix (#25187) there's no visible improvement that justifies the added complexity. Moreover, the recommended storage level with Spark Datasets is MEMORY_AND_DISK (rather than MEMORY_ONLY). This makes RDD caching fairly irrelevant for production use cases with the Dataset runner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

creates a new thread if offer(Runnable) returns false. With a SynchronousQueue under contention, this may return false even if there are already idle threads in the pool. To avoid creating a thread unnecessarily and growing the pool we modify offer to wait with a small timeout of 10ms. This may delay initial execution on the pool but that should be rare as it is encountered only once the high-watermark is exceeded.\r\n\r\nAlso add a timeout to the non-core threads so that the pool reduces size.\r\n\r\nBoth of these changes are motivated to reduce memory usage due to per-thread buffers in Beam and AvroCoder.\r\n\r\nAdd a test contending adds on the pool which previously showed the pool growing beyond the necessary amount (ie created 104 threads when 100 is sufficient).\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

bug in the collection encoder of the Spark dataset runner (aka Spark structured streaming runner) may result in corrupted data after a groupByKey if the dataset is converted to an RDD and persisted.\r\n\r\nThe collection encoder just wraps the underlying serialized UnsafeArrayData for primitive types to present a Collection as a result of deserialization. However, Spark may reuse the underlying unsafe object and with that corrupt values. \r\n\r\nThis PR ensures the data is always copied when exposed. Usage in other cases such as Map deserialization is fine as values are eventually copied when constructing the map.\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce this in a Unit test. VR tests in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/25187 will verify the behavior.\r\n\r\nFixes #25296 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/releases\">github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v0.16.0</h2>\n<h1>What's Changed</h1>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>feat: support native docker compose api (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/476\">#476</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/baez90\"><code>@​baez90</code></a></p>\n<p>Docker Compose v2 is implemented in Go, and for that reason we have decided to provide native Go support to Compose, deprecating the shell-escape based <code>LocalDockerCompose</code>, which was invoking the local binary of compose. Given the version includes the Compose dependency, and the Docker folks added <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/docker/compose/issues/9946#issuecomment-1288923912\">a replace directive until the upcoming Docker 22.06 release is out</a>, we were forced to add it too, causing <strong>consumers of Testcontainers for Go to add the following replace directive</strong> too.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"golang\"><code>replace (\n\tgithub.com/docker/cli =&gt; github.com/docker/cli v20.10.3-0.20221013132413-1d6c6e2367e2+incompatible // 22.06 master branch\n\tgithub.com/docker/docker =&gt; github.com/docker/docker v20.10.3-0.20221013203545-33ab36d6b304+incompatible // 22.06 branch\n\tgithub.com/moby/buildkit =&gt; github.com/moby/buildkit v0.10.1-0.20220816171719-55ba9d14360a // same as buildx\n<pre><code>github.com/opencontainers/runc =&amp;gt; github.com/opencontainers/runc v1.1.2 // Can be removed on next bump of containerd to &amp;gt; 1.6.4\n\n// For k8s dependencies, we use a replace directive, to prevent them being\n// upgraded to the version specified in containerd, which is not relevant to the\n// version needed.\n// See https://github.com/docker/buildx/pull/948 for details.\n// https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/v0.8.1/go.mod#L62-L64\nk8s.io/api =&amp;gt; k8s.io/api v0.22.4\nk8s.io/apimachinery =&amp;gt; k8s.io/apimachinery v0.22.4\nk8s.io/client-go =&amp;gt; k8s.io/client-go v0.22.4\n</code></pre>\n<p>)\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fix: do not prepend garbage in the container.Exec response (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/624\">#624</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></p>\n<p>The signature of the <code>Exec</code> function on a container created by the library has been changed in what we thought it was a non-breaking change manner, using variadic arguments. But we confirmed that it could be a breaking change in the rare case where the Exec function is assigned to a variable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"golang\"><code>// The original Exec function works here because its type is func(context.Context, []string),\n// but the new Exec function’s type is func(context.Context, []string, ...ProcessOption),\n// so the assignment fails at compile time.

As a consequence, the already existing function <code>WithStartupTimeout</code> has been deprecated from the multi-strategy struct.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>feat: Auth config for build images (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/602\">#602</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/paulozenida\"><code>@​paulozenida</code></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>feat: log docker info from compose (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/591\">#591</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🐛 Bug Fixes</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0-pre.8 adds a filesystem configuration API that supports writes, tested by multiple third-party suites. It also brings CompilationCache out of experimental state, obviating a hard to explain Namespace API. Finally, this adds more logging scopes.</p>\n<p>We don't expect any API changes next month, as we prepare for wazero 1.0 in March. Most of the scheduled work will be completing WASI and improving tests, so that our first formal release is trustworthy. Please upgrade to this version and give us feedback on how it's going.</p>\n<p>The best way to contact us is to join <a href=\"https://gophers.slack.com/\">gophers slack</a> #wazero channel. Note: You may need an <a href=\"https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/\">invite</a> to join gophers. If you like what we are doing, please <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/stargazers\">star</a> our repo as folks appreciate it. Meanwhile, let's dig into this month's changes!</p>\n<h1>Writable filesystem support</h1>\n<p>An exciting change for many is the ability to configure writeable filesystems. To do that, we've added <code>ModuleConfig.WithFSConfig</code> which has options to mount directories or a <code>fs.FS</code> such that wasm can access it. Before, we had <code>ModuleConfig.WithFS</code>, and we'll leave that forever. This will help reduce complexity for simple-case configuration.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of how to allow read access to the current directory as the root filesystem, while write access to a different directory as &quot;/tmp&quot;</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>moduleConfig = wazero.NewModuleConfig().\n\t// Make the current directory read-only accessible to the guest.\n\tWithReadOnlyDirMount(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;)\n\t// Make &quot;/tmp/wasm&quot; accessible to the guest as &quot;/tmp&quot;.\n\tWithDirMount(&quot;/tmp/wasm&quot;, &quot;/tmp&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Under the scenes, this maps to appropriate WebAssembly primitives, namely &quot;preopens&quot; for those compiling WASI or a virtual root if  <code>GOOS=js</code>.</p>\n<p>Those using the wazero CLI can take advantage of this with mount-based syntax, which looks very similar to Docker.</p>\n<p>For example, here's the same configuration via the command line:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ wazero run -mount=.:/:ro -mount=/tmp/wasm:/tmp ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Under the scenes is more comprehensive than last time. Those compiling source via WASI or <code>GOOS=js</code> can take advantage of newly supported system calls, tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows operating systems.

We have plans to do that, but after version 1.0. This configuration API was designed to be forwards compatible with a raw filesystem plugin once it is ready.</p>\n<h1>Standard Library Integration Tests</h1>\n<p>For the first time, wazero change depends on 3rd party integration tests for aspects beyond the WebAssembly Core specification. Specifically, we use multiple tests to ensure WASI not only works based on what the spec leads define, but also work in practice in TinyGo and Zig programming languages. By running multiple tests we are able to get an implicit quorum of what certain functions are expected to do, and reduce the amount of surprise by end users who simply want things to work.</p>\n<p>For example, we use wazero instead of wasmtime to run TinyGo wasi target tests. If any fails, our build breaks. We are nearly there with Zig, too, and will be by next month. Both of these are also thanks to the language communities themselves, who have helped champion patches needed to make things portable.</p>\n<p>We also run the emerging <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite\">wasi-testsuite</a>, defined by the spec team. We pass tests they define for the AssemblyScript and C programming languages. We don't yet pass all rust tests recently added from wasmtime: 5 fail mostly due to some edge case functions we've not yet implemented. However, we expect to pass all of them by 1.0 or sooner, or have a very good reason if we don't.</p>\n<p>Beyond WASI, we also test the <code>GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js</code> platform baked into the standard Go sdk. This is typically tested via the node.js runtime (which uses V8), but our CLI works in lieu of that also. As Go considers this experimental, we don't require passing all tests, yet. That said we test each function that also exists in WASI. This helps existing users of <code>GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js</code> as well paves an easier transition for those working on the upcoming <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/go/issues/58141\">Go WASI proposal</a>.</p>\n<p>Getting these tests understood and integrated into our CI took a lot of effort, with special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> for their hard work.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
