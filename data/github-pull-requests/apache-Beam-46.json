context through prism loops to avoid place where blocks could lead to panic.\r\n\r\n* Some cases where a failed bundle was still getting blocked on SDK data ingestion, preventing halting the process.\r\n* Cancel job context with error on failure.\r\n  * This error is presently not directly used.\r\n* Notably happened when test has sufficient data to have multiple data bundles, but didn't have a function registered (which causes deserialization failures on worker side).\r\n\r\nNow there's a single place for where a bundle failure leads to the job being canceled, which makes it a ready target for alternative retry logic in the future. However, at present, the goal is to fail as fast and as clearly as possible.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the bugs described in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1359\">#1359</a>, we had to bump the Docker version to a major version, which moved the <code>types.AuthConfig</code> type to <code>registry.AuthConfig</code>. We used that type as public API, therefore, our API has changed the signature of the method of an interface, which is used to build images from a Dockerfile. Please look at <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1394\">#1394</a> to understand the changes in the <code>GetAuthConfigs</code> method.</p>\n<h2>🚀

version of the JavaCC plugin is out: [release notes](https://github.com/javacc/javaccPlugin/releases/tag/javacc-gradle-plugin-3.0.0). Because the plugin ID changed, it won't be found by usual dependency update mechanisms, so I'm making  PRs manually to update all the major projects on GitHub that are using an older version of the plugin.\r\n\r\nThe new version should make compilation of the parser a bit faster and improve compatibility with future releases of Gradle.\r\n\r\nI locally checked that `./gradlew compileJava` is successful with this change, but have not done any other testing.\r\n\r\nI don't think the change is impactful enough to require an entry in CHANGES.MD, please let me know if you disagree.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

builds on top of #27603 to add support for running inference against a cohort of different models using the KeyedModelHandler. Full design is here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kj3FyWRbJu1KhViX07Z0Gk0MU0842jhYRhI-DMhhcv4/edit#heading=h.wskna8eurvjv\r\n\r\nThis piece adds basic support. In future prs we will need to cover:\r\n\r\n- Example + an E2E test (I have run this in an E2E pipeline, but decided to split the example out from this pr for size reasons)\r\n- Limiting the maximum number of models that can be held in memory\r\n- Model updates support\r\n- Metrics improvements\r\n- Docs\r\n\r\nGiven these gaps, I don't think we should merge before the release cut on Wednesday, but we can get this in after and iterate with small PRs\r\n\r\nPart of #27628\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Change the default architectures for release containers to be both amd64 and arm64.\r\n- Change all the dockerPush tasks called by the release pushAll task to be docker instead, since multi-arch containers are pushed during build.\r\n- Details see the [Change the release process to release multi-arch Beam SDK containers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ikbEJNsFH1D9HqiMqiVyyMlNpDgSqxXK22nUoetzW6I/edit#heading=h.tt3a4uydtlxx) section in the doc.\r\n- Github action test suites that build multi-arch Beam SDK containers: \r\n1. Python ValidatesContainer Dataflow ARM\r\n2. PostCommit Go Dataflow ARM\r\n3. PostCommit Java Examples Dataflow ARM\r\nThose tests build and push multi-arch Beam SDK containers to `us.gcr.io/apache-beam-testing/github-actions`.\r\nThe tests will fail for now since the Dataflow service side change is not yet completed, but by checking the repository we can see the multi-arch containers are tagged and pushed properly.\r\n\r\nTest suites that test ARM components of the multi-arch containers:\r\n1. [beam_PostCommit_Go_Dataflow_ARM.yml](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.github/workflows/beam_PostCommit_Go_Dataflow_ARM.yml)\r\n2.

pleased to release version 1.12.1 of the official Go driver.</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<p>This release fixes a bug in the Go Driver where connections are leaked if a user runs a transaction while connected to a load balancer. To resolve this issue, the Go Driver will now unpin connections when ending a session.</p>\n<p>This release fixes a logging design oversight in which enabling logging with <code>options.LogComponentAll</code> does not result in the publication of logs.</p>\n<p>This release fixes two runtime errors, which occur on unmarshaling an empty bson.RawValue with an invalid type, specifically the 0x00 (null) type, and on marshaling a nil pointer of ReadConcern.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For a full list of tickets included in this release, please see the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3Dimprovement%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.12.1\">Improvements</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3DGODRIVER%20and%20type%3DBug%20and%20status%3Dclosed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.12.1\">Bugs</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/issues/?jql=project%3Dgodriver%20and%20type%3D%22task%22%20and%20status%20%3D%20Closed%20and%20fixVersion%3D1.12.1\">Tasks</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/compare/v1.12.0...v1.12.1\">v1.12.0...v1.12.1</a></p>\n<p>Documentation for the Go driver can be found on <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo?tab=doc\">pkg.go.dev</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/go/\">MongoDB documentation site</a>.

`Errorf()` logging to the tools.Logger type, enabling sending error-leveled logs across the FnAPI to a logging service. The first usage of this is to propagate some dependency errors to logs as errors to the logging service before they are logged to stderr at a `FATAL` level. Also does a little extra cleanup, replacing a deprecated `ioutil.ReadFile()` invocation with `os.ReadFile()`. \r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change fixes a bug in the expansion service discovery that causes the context manager to stop yielding schema-aware transforms available to the given expansion service if any one transform's schema cannot be parsed. This fix forces the context manager to skip transforms that fail to parse and continue to yield transform configs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#27635.\r\n\r\nKryo version 5 includes many useful features including but not limited to serialization of Java 14 records. This PR bumps the Kryo version of the Kryo java extension and addresses the small API changes between v4 and v5.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces no API changes to `KryoCoder`. While Kryo version 5 is not binary-compatible with Kryo v4, previous discussions concluded that:\r\n\r\n> [Since Beam doesn't support \"hot\" upgrade on the fly while running a pipeline, and Kryo extension is used only as a KryoCoder (correct me if I'm wrong) then serialised data should not be stored somewhere after pipeline is stopped. Also, I hope we don't expose any Kryo API to users as well.](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/27635#issuecomment-1660712228) \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

purpose of this PR is to polish the interfaces of `SqsIO.writeBatches()` before the next release cut (Aug 9th).\r\n- `EntryBuilder` was renamed to `EntryMapper` (and there's an additional `EntryMapper.Builder` for convenience)\r\n- `EntryMapper` became optional, if possible a mapper is automatically built leveraging schemas and toRow / fromRow functions.\r\n- Last, `SqsIO.write` is deprecated and implemented by means of `SqsIO.writeBatches()` using batch size 1.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
