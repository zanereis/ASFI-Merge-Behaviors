generate constraints for preview right after images are build, in order to be able to see the output and to diagnose which dependencies have been updated later in the process.\r\n\r\nSo far we were doing it in CI workflow and When constraints generation failed however (for example because pip backtracking takes a log ot time), it faied build image workflow and did not allow tests to complete.\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts constraint generation to CI separate job which does not block tests from running in case constraints generation fails or times out.\r\n\r\nIt also moves out the steps from the composite action which allows to better see which step failed and allows to see the constraints used in each job more easily.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

Airflow running the clear_not_launched_queued_tasks function on a certain frequency (default 30 seconds). When we run the airflow on a large Kube cluster (pods more than > 5K). Internally the clear_not_launched_queued_tasks function loops through each queued task and checks the corresponding worker pod existence in the Kube cluster. Right this existence check using list pods Kube API. The API is taking more than 1s. if there are 120 queued tasks, then it will take ~ 120 seconds (1s * 120). So, this leads the scheduler to spend most of its time in this function rather than scheduling the tasks. It leads to none of the jobs being scheduled or degraded scheduler performance.\r\n\r\nSolution: Use k8 list pods batch api call to get all the worker pod owned by scheduler. Prepare the set of searchable strings using pod labels. Use this set data structure and identify whether the task associated pod exists or not.\r\n\r\nset elements string format:\r\n(dag_id=<dag_id>,task_id=<task_id>,airflow-worker=[,map_index=<map_index>],[run_id=<run_id>]|[execution_date=<execution_date>])\r\n\r\nThe details for the issue is mentioned in the below

Goal is to make the logging configuration more granular.\r\n\r\n*Example*: having one task to show all DEBUG, while the others are on WARNING. I can configure two loggers, and assign them on my dags.\r\n\r\n*Example* of SQLExecuteQueryOperator:\r\n```python\r\nSQLExecuteQueryOperator(\r\n    ...,\r\n    logger_name=\"my.custom.logger\",\r\n    hook_params={\"logger_name\": \"my.custom.logger\"}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Use case:\r\nI am passing data between tasks (typically from APIs to a datawarehouse). I use the SQLOperators and templated jinja to do the inserts. But, huge inserts clogs up the logging view on the UI. Sometimes, the webserver crashes because of it.\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to:\r\n- Enable INFO logging for some tasks, while having it on WARNING for others.\r\n- For the INFO tasks, I would like multiple handlers:\r\n   - One that keeps only warning and error locally (for the webserver)\r\n   - One that throws everything into Elastic, so that the user can visit Kibana to see everything\r\n  \r\nThis is doable with an [advanced logging configuration](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/advanced-logging-configuration.html), and the ability to configure the name of the logger at task-level.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull

sentry-sdk 1.32.0 released on 11th of October fixed handling of utcnow to make it future-compatible with Python 3.12. The breadcrumb timestamp returned was naive and now it is timezone aware with utc specified explicitly as timezone. This broke our tests.\r\n\r\nThe change in sentry that impacted it is\r\nhttps://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/pull/2415\r\n\r\nWe use the opportunity also to bump sentry sdk minimum version to be 1.32.0 from very old 0.8.0 (from 2019). Sentry is a service, so they generally always want you to use the latest version, and sentry has very little requirements on its own to cause conflicts (for Python 3.8+ it only requires \"certifi\" without any specific limitations)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

refactoring is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34931\r\n- unified approach to daemon process creation and moved all daemon-related code to shared util daemon_utils.py.\r\n- moved async thread creation for scheduler so that it happens after entering daemon context (will prevent possible bugs like https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/34816 for scheduler)\r\n- reused some utils like removing PID file of a dead process for all other commands in daemon mode\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

PR updates the required permissions for some endpoints:\r\n-  `update_dag_run_state`,  `clear_dag_run` and `set_dag_run_note` -> it replaces `can read dag` by `can edit dag` similar to what we have in the other endpoints (for example the one used to clear TI state)\r\n-  `post_clear_task_instances` -> it replaces `can read dagrun` by `can edit dagrun`, because the endpoint accepts a parameter `reset_dag_runs` to reset the dagruns states, which should check for edit on dagrun resource.\r\n- `set_task_instance_note` -> it removes `can read dag` because it is useless, the edit permission should be sufficient\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we consider some of these changes as breaking changes, I can create different PRs if needed.

In this iteration, we are integrating with their Embeddings Model.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this Provider is to present users with an alternative embedding model.

#34906 \r\nThis is a potential solution to the issue mentioned above. There is an existing command, `airflow db clean` that removes old records from the DB. This command currently does not support the `triggers` table, so it cannot be used. This PR solves the issue linked above by allowing the user to manually delete outdated records in the `triggers` table, which also removes the notification about the Trigger not being active.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Context\r\nPulling this change out of #34381 into a separate PR as requested [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34381#discussion_r1327980137) by @eladkal\r\n \r\n### Overview\r\nA new logging environment variable to enable task logs to work correctly in containerized executors. K8s has an approach for this, which is followed closely when making it generic in this change. However, I did not convert K8s executor te this new mechanism to keep the change set minimal and reduce blast radius. A follow-up change can be done for this.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- unit test updated and passing as expected\r\n- UAT testing done with the ECS Executor as part of #34381\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

first time ever doing a pull request, so I apologize if I firstly am not doing it correctly. \r\n\r\nI work for a cloud provider, and one of our services is a managed Airflow instance. I have going on two years experience with the service and would love to be a part of the open-source community.

All too often I feel users forget or don't understand the implications of how they write their DAG code. \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nAdded warning on Dynamic DAG creation to ensure users monitor their code results.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This PR specifically adds the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) support for Postgres Provider. [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#pgvector) is a renowned Open-source vector similarity search for Postgres. In this iteration, we are integrating with their Embeddings Model.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this Provider is to present users with an alternative embedding model. This allows them to generate vectors for their proprietary data, a pivotal step towards establishing integrations with LLM models like ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nExample DAG:\r\nThe `PgVectorIngestOperator` can accept either a list of strings or a callable returning a list of strings.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

This would be useful to run the operator in cloud environments and would also be helpful to run spark or scala notebooks\r\n\r\nIt extends papermill to support new engine using the entry_points as described [here](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending-entry-points.html)\r\n\r\nIt adds unittest and also a system test to run in CI environments.\r\n\r\nValidated using below steps in breeze environment:\r\n```\r\n* breeze ci-image build --upgrade-to-newer-dependencies\r\n* breeze start-airflow\r\n* pytest --system papermill
