I have add a Deep Residual Network example for cifar10\n#### Commands & setups:\n- \n  set following parameters in example/image-classification/train_model.py \n  momentum = 0.9, wd = 0.0001, initializer = mx.init.Xavier(rnd_type=\"gaussian\", factor_type=\"in\", magnitude=2.0)\n- set n=3(3 for 20 layers, n=9 for 56 layers) in the get_symbol function in example/image-classification/symbol_resnet-28-small.py\n- first train the network with lr=0.1 for 80 epochs\n\n```\npython example/image-classification/train_cifar10.py --network resnet-28-small --num-examples 50000 --lr 0.1 --num-epochs 80 --model-prefix cifar10/resnet \n```\n- second train the network with lr=0.01 from epoch 81 to epoch 120, with lr=0.001 from epoch 121 to epoch 160\n\n```\npython example/image-classification/train_cifar10.py --network resnet-28-small --num-examples 50000 --model-prefix cifar10/resnet --load-epoch 80 --lr 0.01 --lr-factor 0.1 --lr-factor-epoch 40 --num-epochs 200 \n```\n\nin the paper, he train cifar10 for 160 epoch, I set num-epoch to 200 because I want to see whether it is usefull when set lr=0.0001\n\nsince it needs 160 epochs, please be patient\n#### Accuracy:\n- for 20 layers resnet, accuracy=0.905+\n- for 32 layers resnet, accuracy=0.908+\n- for 56 layers resnet, accuracy=0.915+\n#### Though the numbers are a little bit lower than the paper, but it does obey the rule: the deeper, the better\n#### Differences to the paper on cifar10 network setup\n1. in the paper, the author use identity shortcut when dealing with increasing dimensions, while I use 1x1 convolutions to deal with it\n2. in the paper, 4 pixels are padded on each side and a 32x32 crop is randomly sampled from the padded image, while I use the dataset provided by mxnet, so the input is 28x28, as a results for 3 different kinds of 2n layers output map sizes are 28x28, 14x14, 7x7, instead of 32x32, 16x16, 8x8 in the paper.\n\nthe above two reason might answer why the accuracy is a bit lower than the paper, I suppose.\nOff course, there might be other reasons (for example the true network architecture may be different from my script, since my script is just my understanding of the paper), if you find out, please tell me, declanxu@gmail.com or declanxu@126.com, thanks\n\n@winstywang @tqchen @antinucleon

and setup dato-deps toolchains\n2. download and setup miniconda python toolchains\n3. generate platform specific config.mk based on the template\nmake/dato-config.mk\n\nDetailed changes:\n- add template make/dato-config.mk\n- replace \"wget\" with crossplatform python download utilities\n- add runtime linker search path (rpath) for libmxnet.so to find dependent\n  libraries\n- add a make target copy_cuda_deps to copy all dependent cuda libraries\n  under lib/\n- remove -lcuda from

change it as the way implemented in KVStore->set_updater, because it is necessary for supporting JNI callback function (scala-package in progress).\n\nIn order to support JNI callback, we have to bind the function with a jobject, (see https://github.com/javelinjs/mxnet/blob/scala-package-cc/scala-package/native/src/main/native/ml_dmlc_mxnet_native_c_api.cc#L217), which is impossible when we deal with a pure C function ptr. \n\nAnd here is what I'm going to do once this PR is accepted: https://github.com/javelinjs/mxnet/blob/scala-package-cc/scala-package/native/src/main/native/ml_dmlc_mxnet_native_c_api.cc#L466\n\nPlease let me know if there exists any better solution.\n\nThis PR

was curious about #1053 so I wrote a test for it. All seems to be good except for a little weirdness around `fixed_gamma = True`. The gradient appears to only be correct if gamma is set to 1 (I think. Its hard to tell 100% if I am messing something else up). I took a look in the cpp code and this assumption seems to be reflected there.
