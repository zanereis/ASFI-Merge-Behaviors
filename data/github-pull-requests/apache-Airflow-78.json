Now I have them, am willing to learn on the testing side given how newbie i am on this part.  \r\nI'll check the airflow developers guideline again meanwhile, i submit this piece of code which add service account impersonation support for ssh connections between 2 GCE instances using IAP tunneling

improves (or fixes) the `workers.safeToEvict` usage.\r\n\r\nKubernetes administrators/users agree that `cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict` can be managed to avoid the Autoscaler to kill the worker pod when scaling nodes down.\r\n\r\n> When this annotation is set to \"true\", the cluster autoscaler is allowed to evict a Pod even if other rules would normally prevent that. The cluster autoscaler never evicts Pods that have this annotation explicitly set to \"false\"; you could set that on an important Pod that you want to keep running. If this annotation is not set then the cluster autoscaler follows its Pod-level behavior.\r\n\r\nSo, if I set `workers.safeToEvict` to `false`, it gets nothing. The Autoscaler will kill that still. Because the Helm chart has no effect on handling that. See:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        {{- if .Values.workers.safeToEvict }}\r\n        cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: \"true\"\r\n        {{- end }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat about if I need to set that to false? I couldn't. Anybody is unable to.\r\n\r\nA probaly **workaround** would set up `workers.podAnnotations` with map of _annotations_ and `workers.safeToEvict` falsely together.\r\n\r\nPlease, check it out carefully.

advance!","created_at":"2023-10-23T14:27:51Z","updated_at":"2023-10-29T21:59:01Z","closed_at":"2023-10-27T17:26:52Z","merged_at":"2023-10-27T17:26:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"764a0e3c956c839fee1d62f1056c8308f5c3e53d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1971984525,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTcxOTg0NTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:helm-chart","name":"area:helm-chart","color":"024e91","default":false,"description":"Airflow

3.12 has a few breaking changes comparing to earlier versions. While 3.7 - 3.11 were largely backwards compatible, Python 3.12 is the first one for a long time that started to break things more aggressively.\r\n\r\nFor now we know that Airflow will not work with Python 3.12 mainly because of distutils removal (https://peps.python.org/pep-0632/) and not because of Airflow's usage of it but pendulum's before version 3.\r\n\r\nWhile we are working on getting Pendulum 3 support in #34744 and the #34746, there are likely other dependencies that have similar issue.\r\n\r\nUntil we fix it and add official 3.12 support, we can limit airflow to not be installable on 3.12.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This fix was previously attempted in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32893 but was later reverted due to inadvertent issues with other connections in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33032.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the revert was because non-applicable fields were being shown in connections. Instead of moving the instantiation of CodeMirror on textArea, we can declare a global editor variable that is populated if the extra field exists on the connection. If it does exist and a user wants to test a connection with extras, we will call `editor.save` to save the value to textArea which will make it accessible in `getSerializedFormData`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nCheck other connections and make sure they look okay\r\n\r\n<img width=\"780\" alt=\"image\"

PR is part of our larger effort to add first-class integrations to support LLMOps that was [presented at Airflow Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgA6m3ggKhs&t=4s).\r\n\r\nIn this PR we are adding Pinecone Provider. Pinecone is a fully managed vector database that makes it easy to add vector search to production applications. The primary objective of this Provider is to present users with an alternative Vector Database. \r\n\r\nExample DAG:\r\nThe PineconeIngestOperator can accept either a list vector or a callable returning a list vector.\r\n```\r\nPineconeIngestOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"pinecone_vector_ingest\",\r\n        index_name=index_name,\r\n        input_vectors=[\r\n            (\"id1\", [1.0,

The workaround to it until https://github.com/pypa/pipx/issues/1092 is solved is to downgrade packaging to < 23.2 - this is mostly applicable to fresh installations of `pipx` that pull the latest packaging.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds appropriate description to breeze installation process\r\n- what to do when it fails, it also updates the advice printed when the fallback to non-editable installation and provide an advice to downgrade packaging.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

modules that are not fully covered is available in the command code\r\n- If a module achieves full coverage, the tool flags an error, so the module is removed from the list of not yet fully covered.\r\n- Also if a module at 100% coverage goes below, the tool flags it and asks that it should be improved.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the coverage is not enforced even on the CI.

PR is part of our larger effort to add first-class integrations to support LLMOps that was [presented at Airflow Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgA6m3ggKhs&t=4s). \r\n\r\nThis PR adds explicitly the Weaviate Provider. Weaviate is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings. Storing vector embedding is one of the vital steps in LLM ops. This provider adds the ability to interact the with vector database using the phyton client. \r\n\r\nExample DAG:\r\nThe `WeaviateIngestOperator` can accept either JSON or a callable that returns

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19816#issuecomment-983311373\r\nSee also: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/20039\r\nBroke with: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33520\r\n\r\nWe can get into trouble for text types that cannot be initiated with re2's `type(obj)()` call. The `secrets_masker` thus fails, which triggers a warning log, which also fails because we pass the object to the logger, which is then masked again, and so forth.\r\n\r\nWe can break the recursion by printing out the `repr` of the object in question in the warning log. This issue has occured previously: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19816#issuecomment-983311373\r\n\r\nI noticed this issue while working with a DAG that calls Airflow's DB cleanup function, thus I'm fixing the logging call in `db_cleanup` to log a stringified name instead of the `quoted_name` object.\r\n\r\nI thought about fixing the `SecretsMasker` call to the reducer, i.e. only passing objects that re2 can handle (i.e. having a parameterless constructor), but decided against it. Checking for this would probably not be cheap and considering this scenario is quite unlikely, I think it's better to simply fail and emit a warning log (without the infinite recursion :)).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI added a basic test that fails next time someone refactors the warning log. I also used the following DAG for a more comprehensive end-to-end test:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.models import Variable\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\n\r\nclass MyStringClass(str):\r\n    def __init__(self, required_arg):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\ndef fail(task_instance):\r\n    # make sure the `SecretsMasker` has a replacer\r\n    Variable.set(key=\"secret\", value=\"secret_value\")\r\n    Variable.get(\"secret\")\r\n    # trigger the infinite recursion\r\n    task_instance.log.info(\"%s\", MyStringClass(\"secret_value\"))\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"secrets_masker_recursion\",\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 9, 26),\r\n):\r\n    PythonOperator(task_id=\"fail\", python_callable=fail)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is part of our larger effort to add first-class integrations to support LLMOps that was [presented at Airflow Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgA6m3ggKhs&t=4s). \r\n\r\nThis PR adds explicitly the OpenAI Provider. OpenAI is a leading American artificial intelligence organization, which offers one of the most used LLM - ChatGPT and offers embedding models. \r\n \r\nThe primary objective of this Provider is to present users with an alternative embedding model. This allows them to generate vectors for their proprietary data, a pivotal step towards establishing integrations with LLM models like ChatGPT.\r\n\r\nExample DAG:\r\nThe `OpenAIEmbeddingOperator` can accept either a string or a callable returning a list of strings.\r\n```\r\nOpenAIEmbeddingOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"embedding_using_xcom_data\",\r\n        conn_id=\"openai_default\",\r\n        input_text=xcom_text[\"input_text\"],\r\n        model=\"text-embedding-ada-002\",\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nEmail Discussion related to the effort can be found here -

This level of granularity is not achievable by overriding the template_fields.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it provides a cleaner approach to avoid rendering files, in contrast to the documented method of leaving a trailing space within the string.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

far, we regenerated the constraints in order to get them updated in constraint branches at the end of the CI build when we knew all the builds succeded. However this was not perfect for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* there was a race condition that a dependency had been released between the time images were built and tests completed. While it had no impact on \"source\" constraints (they reflect what is in the image), it could change the PyPI constraints generated or \"no-providers\" constraints, because they use \"current\" set of dependencies in PyPI to generate them.\r\n\r\n* generating constraints (for PyPI and \"no-providers\") takes time because `pip` has to resolve dependencies again - taking into account what is in the PyPI registry, and this can take a long time (minutes or even it can lead to long `pip` backtracking. We generally cancel running builds when new commit is merged in main, so this could lead to such constraint job being canceled by subsequent merge\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the fact that we have now \"preview-constraints\" job that uploads constraints as artifacts in CI workflow, and instead of regenerating the constraints, we can download the constraints from uploaded artifact and use it - this is very quick and we can also make a clear dependency between \"preview\" and \"update\" constraints jobs - making it clear in case of PIP backtracking that we have problem with constraints, not with the image. This will make it far clearer when we will have problems with constraints and backtracking that this is the real issue we have (allowing such PRs to get merged while constraints backtracking problem is being worked on.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

\"test/operators\" are one of the longest tests of ours - mainly because of a lot of Python virtualenv operators taking a lot of time to create and tear-down virtualenvs. They contributed a lot to the \"Other\" category making it one that run for the longest time.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve usage of parallel cores, we separate operator tests to a new \"Operators\" test typ and let them run in parallel to Other tests - this should help in speeding up the tests overall by around 3-4 minutes on self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n

test seem to run very slow when run for parallel tests and we seem to have some very much varying speeds of the VM instances from Amazon today (test times range between 16 minutes to 35 minutes which is really worrying).\r\n\r\nThe test_cli_run_time test started to fail for those \"slow\" machines.\r\n\r\nIn order to stabilize the test suite, we temporary quarantine the tests.\r\n\r\nThe Quarantined tests run in a complete isolation - sequentially, no matter what machine they run on, no parallel runs are executed. This should stabilize the test in order to be able to investigate the cause of the varying speed of test execution.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
