However, FileContext implementations may not exist for many scheme for which there may be FileSystem implementations. In those cases, rather than failing completely, we should fallback to the FileSystem based implementation, and log warning that there may be file consistency issues in case the log directory is concurrently modified.\n\nIn addition I have also added more tests to increase the code coverage.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test. \nTested on cluster with custom file system.\n","created_at":"2016-03-24T01:46:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T03:09:18Z","closed_at":"2016-03-26T03:09:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b89227829bf50cd1e199ee13d5349fe19053729","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11925/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11925/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11925/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d837c3207c17000159f2ca5e77e93efe6b24705d","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-14109","ref":"SPARK-14109","sha":"d837c3207c17000159f2ca5e77e93efe6b24705d","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

The new iterator won't reference to the underlying ByteBuffer in ByteBufferMessageSet. Therefore, serializer won't serialize the entire byte[] of FetchResponse for each message.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested with the real job and verified the serialization issue is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSessionCatalog, introduced in #11750, is a catalog that keeps track of temporary functions and tables, and delegates metastore operations to ExternalCatalog. This functionality overlaps a lot with the existing analysis.Catalog.\n\nAs of this commit, SessionCatalog and ExternalCatalog will no longer be dead code. There are still things that need to be done after this patch, namely:\n- SPARK-14013: Properly implement temporary functions in SessionCatalog\n- SPARK-13879: Decide which DDL/DML commands to support natively in Spark\n- SPARK-?????: Implement the ones we do want to support through SessionCatalog.\n- SPARK-?????: Merge SQL/HiveContext\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is largely a refactoring task so there are no new tests introduced. The particularly relevant tests are SessionCatalogSuite and ExternalCatalogSuite.\n\nNOTE: This one has an extra commit on top of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11836 for fixing python tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-23T15:06:17Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T18:47:05Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T18:06:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4be1032de2c3077cc2ff43eee07d63b0a8fb554c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11918/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11918/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11918/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3c40f71281aca77cf0e77f3c5c44c078f3cea9e","head":{"label":"yhuai:use-session-catalog","ref":"use-session-catalog","sha":"d3c40f71281aca77cf0e77f3c5c44c078f3cea9e","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7d1175011c976756efcd4e4e4f70a8fd6f287026","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently SparkContext.getCallSite() makes a call to Utils.getCallSite().\n\n```\n private[spark] def getCallSite(): CallSite = {\n    val callSite = Utils.getCallSite()\n    CallSite(\n      Option(getLocalProperty(CallSite.SHORT_FORM)).getOrElse(callSite.shortForm),\n      Option(getLocalProperty(CallSite.LONG_FORM)).getOrElse(callSite.longForm)\n    )\n  }\n```\n\nHowever, in some places utils.withDummyCallSite(sc) is invoked to avoid expensive threaddumps within getCallSite(). But Utils.getCallSite() is evaluated earlier causing threaddumps to be computed. \n\nThis can have severe impact on smaller queries (that finish in 10-20 seconds) having large number of RDDs.\n\nCreating this patch for lazy evaluation of  getCallSite.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new test cases are added. Following standalone test was tried out manually. Also, built entire spark binary and tried with few SQL queries in TPC-DS  and TPC-H in multi node cluster\n\n```\ndef run(): Unit = {\n    val conf = new SparkConf()\n    val sc = new SparkContext(\"local[1]\", \"test-context\", conf)\n    val start: Long = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    val confBroadcast = sc.broadcast(new SerializableConfiguration(new Configuration()))\n    Utils.withDummyCallSite(sc) {\n      //Large tables end up creating 5500 RDDs\n      for(i <- 1 to 5000) {\n       //ignore nulls in RDD as its mainly for testing callSite\n        val testRDD = new HadoopRDD(sc, confBroadcast, None, null,\n          classOf[NullWritable], classOf[Writable], 10)\n      }\n    }\n    val end: Long = System.currentTimeMillis();\n    println(\"Time taken : \" + (end - start))\n  }\n\ndef main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    run\n  }\n```\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\n\n…CallSite()

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Deprecated unionAll. It is pretty confusing to have both \"union\" and \"unionAll\" when the two do the same thing in Spark but are different in SQL.\n2. Rename reduce in KeyValueGroupedDataset to reduceGroups so it is more consistent with rest of the functions in KeyValueGroupedDataset. Also makes it more obvious what \"reduce\" and \"reduceGroups\" mean. Previously it was confusing because it could be reducing a Dataset, or just reducing groups.\n3. Added a \"name\" function, which is more natural to name columns than \"as\" for non-SQL users.\n4. Remove \"subtract\" function since it is just an alias for \"except\".\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAll changes should be covered by existing tests. Also added couple test cases to cover \"name\".\n","created_at":"2016-03-23T01:22:53Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T08:52:01Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T06:44:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"165c9fdb3dcf66ff69a1206bac74ea884577625d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7e98b87e51842a2cd84430cccac3955901d2229","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14088","ref":"SPARK-14088","sha":"a7e98b87e51842a2cd84430cccac3955901d2229","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to support star expansion in hash. For example,\n\n``` SQL\nval structDf = testData2.select(\"a\", \"b\").as(\"record\")\nstructDf.select(hash($\"*\")\n```\n\nIn addition, it refactors the codes for the rule `ResolveStar` and fixes a regression for star expansion in group by when using SQL API. For example, \n\n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM testData2 group by a, b\n```\n\ncc @cloud-fan Now, the code for star resolution is much cleaner. The coverage is better. Could you check if this refactoring is good? Thanks!\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a few test cases to cover it.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`GBTClassifier` and `GBTRegressor` should use random seed for reproducible results. Because of the nature of current unit tests, which compare GBTs in ML and GBTs in MLlib for equality, I also added a random seed to MLlib GBT algorithm. I made alternate constructors in `mllib.tree.GradientBoostedTrees` to accept a random seed, but left them as private so as to not change the API unnecessarily.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests verify that functionality did not change. Other ML algorithms do not seem to have unit tests that directly test the functionality of random seeding, but reproducibility with seeding for GBTs is effectively verified in existing tests. I can add more tests if needed.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T22:36:32Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T22:35:46Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T22:10:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1496f485e35d95993e057b1d5341bc04c242fb90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/301a5707784c077b93517f3c34754bd117521436","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-13952","ref":"SPARK-13952","sha":"301a5707784c077b93517f3c34754bd117521436","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR for ticket SPARK-13019 is based on previous PR(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11108).\nSince PR(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11108) is breaking scala-2.10 build, more work is needed to fix build errors.\n\nWhat I did new in this PR is adding keyword argument for 'fractions':\n`val approxSample = data.sampleByKey(withReplacement = false, fractions = fractions)`\n`val exactSample = data.sampleByKeyExact(withReplacement = false, fractions = fractions)`\n\nI reopened ticket on JIRA but sorry I don't know how to reopen a GitHub pull request, so I just submitting a new pull request.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual build testing on local machine, build based on scala-2.10.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T22:03:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T09:35:52Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T09:35:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a32cd24224834f867a6fe54143f77ddaa1e66174","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ceebd3600efc7d6b509c4dae9c08e13890574fec","head":{"label":"keypointt:SPARK-13019","ref":"SPARK-13019","sha":"ceebd3600efc7d6b509c4dae9c08e13890574fec","user":{"login":"keypointt","id":3925641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt","html_url":"https://github.com/keypointt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43392545,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzM5MjU0NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"keypointt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"keypointt","id":3925641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt","html_url":"https://github.com/keypointt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keypointt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/keypointt/spark","description":"Mirror

patch refactors the `MemoryStore` so that it can be tested without needing to construct / mock an entire `BlockManager`.\n- The block manager's serialization- and compression-related methods have been moved from `BlockManager` to `SerializerManager`.\n- `BlockInfoManager`is now passed directly to classes that need it, rather than being passed via the `BlockManager`.\n- The `MemoryStore` now calls `dropFromMemory` via a new `BlockEvictionHandler` interface rather than directly calling the `BlockManager`. This change helps to enforce a narrow interface between the `MemoryStore` and `BlockManager` functionality and makes this interface easier to mock in tests.\n- Several of the block unrolling tests have been moved from `BlockManagerSuite` into a new `MemoryStoreSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T20:50:23Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T17:19:59Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T17:17:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13bfe86da9b3add70f6bc90b007c52a98e76de3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/548ecc0c385fb663e946edfe2a3707ce8711a8c9","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:reduce-memorystore-blockmanager-coupling","ref":"reduce-memorystore-blockmanager-coupling","sha":"548ecc0c385fb663e946edfe2a3707ce8711a8c9","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

PR adds a new `Sink` implementation that writes out Parquet files.  In order to correctly handle partial failures while maintaining exactly once semantics, the files for each batch are written out to a unique directory and then atomically appended to a metadata log.  When a parquet based `DataSource` is initialized for reading, we first check for this log directory and use it instead of file listing when present.\n\nUnit tests are added, as well as a stress test that checks the answer after non-deterministic injected failures.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T19:04:00Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T20:05:24Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T20:05:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f53d8b873d887fdfd27e95c2ad5bd1745d52774e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e821f2f558fc3426a13e89598eb1a3eb887daeff","head":{"label":"marmbrus:fileSink","ref":"fileSink","sha":"e821f2f558fc3426a13e89598eb1a3eb887daeff","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch enables use of OrcRelation for SQL queries which read data from Hive tables. Changes in this patch:\n- Added a new rule `OrcConversions` which would alter the plan to use `OrcRelation`. In this diff, the conversion is done only for reads.\n- Added a new config `spark.sql.hive.convertMetastoreOrc` to control the conversion\n\nBEFORE \n\n```\nscala>  hqlContext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM orc_table\").explain(true)\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\n'Project [unresolvedalias(*, None)]\n+- 'UnresolvedRelation `orc_table`, None\n\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\nkey: string, value: string\nProject [key#171,value#172]\n+- MetastoreRelation default, orc_table, None\n\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nMetastoreRelation default, orc_table, None\n\n== Physical Plan ==\nHiveTableScan [key#171,value#172], MetastoreRelation default, orc_table, None\n```\n\nAFTER\n\n```\nscala> hqlContext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM orc_table\").explain(true)\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\n'Project [unresolvedalias(*, None)]\n+- 'UnresolvedRelation `orc_table`, None\n\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\nkey: string, value: string\nProject [key#76,value#77]\n+- SubqueryAlias orc_table\n   +- Relation[key#76,value#77] ORC part: struct<>, data: struct<key:string,value:string>\n\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nRelation[key#76,value#77] ORC part: struct<>, data: struct<key:string,value:string>\n\n== Physical Plan ==\nWholeStageCodegen\n:  +- Scan ORC part: struct<>, data: struct<key:string,value:string>[key#76,value#77] InputPaths: file:/user/hive/warehouse/orc_table\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added a new unit test. Ran existing unit tests\n- Ran with production like data\n## Performance gains\n\nRan on a production table in Facebook (note that the data was in DWRF file format which is similar to ORC)\n\nBest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR continues the work in #11486 from @yinxusen with some code refactoring. In R package e1071, `naiveBayes` supports both categorical (Bernoulli) and continuous features (Gaussian), while in MLlib we support Bernoulli and multinomial. This PR implements the common subset: Bernoulli.\n\nI moved the implementation out from SparkRWrappers to NaiveBayesWrapper to make it easier to read. Argument names, default values, and summary now match e1071's naiveBayes.\n\nI removed the preprocess part that omit NA values because we don't know which columns to process.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest against output from R package e1071's naiveBayes.\n\ncc: @yanboliang @yinxusen \n\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdds a sandbox link per driver in the dispatcher ui\nImplementation would have been straightforward if it was not for this issue:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-4992\nAs a workaround we have to get runtime info from the master and the slave where the driver was launched on as a task.\nThere are no scalability issues because we use master/state-summary instead of master/state.json\nand ask one slave for the directory of the driver's task.\n\nThe sandbox uri has the following format:\n`http://172.17.0.1:5050/#/slaves/1d01c68e-96e7-4196-a340-4da8e12892c0-S1/browse?path=%2Ftmp%2Fmesos%2Fslaves%2F1d01c68e-96e7-4196-a340-4da8e12892c0-S1%2Fframeworks%2F1d01c68e-96e7-4196-a340-4da8e12892c0-0009%2Fexecutors%2Fdriver-20160322160503-0001%2Fruns%2Fd90b463e-ad52-433e-bcdc-6c3ffbafdc68`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested with the mesos test suite here: https://github.com/typesafehub/mesos-spark-integration-tests. \nAttached image shows the ui

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Currently log4j which uses distributed cache only adds to AM's classpath, not executor's, this is introduced in #9118, which breaks the original meaning of that PR, so here add log4j file to the classpath of both AM and executors.\n2. Automatically upload metrics.properties to distributed cache, so that it could be used by remote driver and executors implicitly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test and integration test is done.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T10:07:46Z","updated_at":"2016-03-31T17:29:51Z","closed_at":"2016-03-31T17:29:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65360444b3e24cbb55bc5ad3e4a76fbb006c7dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a619dfdf7dc12a3ecb080fcbf292c0c39a734b98","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-14062","ref":"SPARK-14062","sha":"a619dfdf7dc12a3ecb080fcbf292c0c39a734b98","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds support for TimestampType in the vectorized parquet reader\n## How was this patch tested?\n1. `VectorizedColumnReader` initially had a gating condition on `primitiveType.getPrimitiveTypeName() == PrimitiveType.PrimitiveTypeName.INT96)` that made us fall back on parquet-mr for handling timestamps. This condition is now removed.\n2. The `ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite` (that tests for all supported hive types -- including `TimestampType`) fails when the gating condition is removed (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11808) and should now pass with this change. Similarly, the `ParquetHiveCompatibilitySuite.SPARK-10177 timestamp` test that fails when the gating condition is removed, should now pass as well.\n3.  Added tests in `HadoopFsRelationTest` that test both the dictionary encoded and non-encoded versions across all supported datatypes.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T07:51:54Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T19:15:23Z","closed_at":"2016-03-23T19:15:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a972b083dc03c9f62fa32b43d2fb491ab27e12e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00b1f12166e0d506ed8339ad12e54a3d4a6abf4b","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:timestamp-parquet","ref":"timestamp-parquet","sha":"00b1f12166e0d506ed8339ad12e54a3d4a6abf4b","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13953\n\nCurrently, JSON data source creates a new field in `PERMISSIVE` mode for storing malformed string.\nThis field can be renamed via `spark.sql.columnNameOfCorruptRecord` option but it is a global configuration.\n\nThis PR make that option can be applied per read and can be specified via `option()`. This will overwrites `spark.sql.columnNameOfCorruptRecord` if it is set.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were used and `./dev/run_tests` for coding style tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T07:33:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:53Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T12:32:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e65d4f855695e97c9b214d6cc58d4ad932485496","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/73a891394455aed0cf155db9132c1e38fa143225","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-13953","ref":"SPARK-13953","sha":"73a891394455aed0cf155db9132c1e38fa143225","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch changed the return type for SQLContext.range from `Dataset[Long]` (Scala primitive) to `Dataset[java.lang.Long]` (Java boxed long).\n\nPreviously, SPARK-13894 changed the return type of range from `Dataset[Row]` to `Dataset[Long]`. The problem is that due to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4388, Scala compiles primitive types in generics into just Object, i.e. range at bytecode level now just returns `Dataset[Object]`. This is really bad for Java users because they are losing type safety and also need to add a type cast every time they use range.\n\nTalked to Jason Zaugg from Lightbend (Typesafe) who suggested the best approach is to return `Dataset[java.lang.Long]`. The downside is that when Scala users want to explicitly type a closure used on the dataset returned by range, they would need to use `java.lang.Long` instead of the Scala `Long`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe signature change should be covered by existing unit tests and API tests. I also added a new test case in DatasetSuite for range.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T07:26:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T18:39:33Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T18:39:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43d17970cb2c4fe759e318ecfc23a8a1abb7b8cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8272a1fc8204a1124ef0aad40a3077caedb72d10","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-14063","ref":"SPARK-14063","sha":"8272a1fc8204a1124ef0aad40a3077caedb72d10","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

patch refactors the BlockManager and MemoryManager locking/synchronization logic in order to allow MemoryStore blocks to be dropped to the disk in parallel, significantly reducing `MemoryManager` lock contention when acquiring storage memory.\n## Key change\n\nPrior to this patch, `MemoryStore.evictBlocksToFreeSpace()` synchronized on `memoryManager` for the entire block-dropping process. This patch reduces the scope of the synchronization to only cover the phase in which we are selecting the set of blocks to be evicted. Once a task has committed to dropping a set of blocks, it now releases the `memoryManager` lock and performs the block eviction without holding any locks. This allows multiple tasks to drop blocks to disk in parallel and avoids blocking non-spilling tasks via contention on the `memoryManager` lock.\n\nOne tricky concern is preventing tasks from stealing the freed storage memory which results from eviction. To address this, this patch modifies the eviction path so that evicted blocks' memory is not immediately freed with the memory manager. Once all of a tasks's block evictions have completed, tasks now compare the total amount of memory freed from eviction (which could exceed their request size) to the amount of memory needed and either acquire more memory or free excess storage memory.\n\nAnother concern is making sure that a single block isn't double-evicted by multiple tasks. Double-eviction is prevented by the fact that tasks obtain exclusive write locks on all of the blocks that they will evict and the fact that the process of selecting which blocks to evict is still synchronized on the `memoryManager`.\n\nNote that a single task will still spill blocks sequentially, so parallelism only results from multiple tasks triggering separate block evictions. If we want to enable a single task's evictions to proceed in parallel then we can do that in a separate followup patch (it should be a fairly straightforward change).\n## Motivating performance results\n\nThis patch is motivated by a simple `spark-shell` benchmark that I wrote to stress the BlockManager's block eviction path:\n\n``` scala\nimport org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel\nval startTime = System.currentTimeMillis\n(1 to 100).map { _ => \n  sc.parallelize(1 to 1000, 100)\n    .map(x => new Array[Byte](1024 * 1024 / 10))\n    .persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)\n}.map { x => x.count(); x }\nval endTime = System.currentTimeMillis\nprintln((endTime - startTime) / 1000.0)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Prior to this patch**, I observed extreme contention for the `UnifiedMemoryManager`'s monitor:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/13939792/453e3ac6-ef95-11e5-80fc-c12ea5d12a66.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/13939772/273e4a66-ef95-11e5-80c2-fb181733d2c0.png)\n\n---\n\n**After this patch**, the contention on the `UnifiedMemoryManager` lock is significantly reduced and the lock contention bottlenecks shifted to other sources:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/13939698/9d70557c-ef94-11e5-9af5-c99f2a342793.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50748/13939711/b0229bc6-ef94-11e5-8bff-520f58da726e.png)\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T02:28:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T16:19:56Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T16:19:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b39100926fb99234fdf55d85b3ee2d6ee98a06df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/560e2d2beb6660c687590ed9e64d46a84374184e","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-3000","ref":"SPARK-3000","sha":"560e2d2beb6660c687590ed9e64d46a84374184e","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, for the key that can not fit within a long,  we build a hash map for UnsafeHashedRelation, it's converted to BytesToBytesMap after serialization and deserialization. We should build a BytesToBytesMap directly to have better memory efficiency.\n\nIn order to do that, BytesToBytesMap should support multiple (K,V) pair with the same K,  Location.putNewKey() is renamed to Location.append(), which could append multiple values for the same key (same Location). `Location.newValue()` is added to find the next value for the same key.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests. Added benchmark for broadcast hash join with duplicated keys.\n","created_at":"2016-03-21T23:43:43Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T22:33:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T20:09:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd8a56c2b54bb5b6f2a928de31a73f5a530e17aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1653294bdebe2c6c0db6dce5beca870a3e58ef7","head":{"label":"davies:map2","ref":"map2","sha":"b1653294bdebe2c6c0db6dce5beca870a3e58ef7","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds support for reading `DecimalTypes` with high (> 18) precision in `VectorizedColumnReader`\n## How was this patch tested?\n1. `VectorizedColumnReader` initially had a gating condition on `primitiveType.getDecimalMetadata().getPrecision() > Decimal.MAX_LONG_DIGITS()` that made us fall back on parquet-mr for handling high-precision decimals. This condition is now removed.\n2. In particular, the `ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite` (that tests for all supported hive types -- including `DecimalType(25, 5)`) fails when the gating condition is removed (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11808) and should now pass with this

returns true and works well. The only exception case is direct comparison between `Row(Float.NaN)` and `Row(Double.NaN)`. The following is the example: the last two expressions had better be **`true`** and **`List([NaN])`** for consistency.\n\n``` scala\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, spark history server REST API provides functionality to query applications by application start time range based on minDate and maxDate query parameters, but it  lacks support to query applications by their end time. In this pull request we are proposing optional minEndDate and maxEndDate query parameters and filtering capability based on these parameters to spark history server REST API. This functionality can be used for following queries,\n1. Applications finished in last 'x' minutes\n2. Applications finished before 'y' time\n3. Applications finished between 'x' time to 'y' time\n4. Applications started from 'x' time and finished before 'y' time.\n\nFor backward compatibility, we can keep existing minDate and maxDate query parameters as they are and they can continue support filtering based on start time range.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests and 4 new unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-21T22:22:35Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T17:39:23Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T14:44:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"920eb992830f9377ecb7603260fbf7177a8807a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1403362ecdeb3e85667c26bc60da9672c0e6b90","head":{"label":"paragpc:master-SHS-query-by-endtime_2","ref":"master-SHS-query-by-endtime_2","sha":"a1403362ecdeb3e85667c26bc60da9672c0e6b90","user":{"login":"paragpc","id":5827354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5827354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc","html_url":"https://github.com/paragpc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52905219,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjkwNTIxOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"paragpc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paragpc","id":5827354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MjczNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5827354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc","html_url":"https://github.com/paragpc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paragpc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paragpc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a follow-up of PR #11348.\n\nAfter PR #11348, a predicate is never pushed through a project as long as the project contains any non-deterministic fields. Thus, it's impossible that the candidate filter condition can reference any non-deterministic projected fields, and related logic can be safely cleaned up.\n\nTo be more specific, the following optimization is allowed:\n\n``` scala\n// From:\ndf.select('a, 'b).filter('c > rand(42))\n// To:\ndf.filter('c > rand(42)).select('a, 'b)\n```\n\nwhile this isn't:\n\n``` scala\n// From:\ndf.select('a, rand('b) as 'rb, 'c).filter('c > 'rb)\n// To:\ndf.filter('c > rand('b)).select('a, rand('b) as 'rb, 'c)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test cases should do the

change:\n- Removed spark.mllib.tree.DecisionTree implementation of tree and forest learning.\n- spark.mllib now calls the spark.ml implementation.\n- Moved unit tests (of tree learning internals) from spark.mllib to spark.ml as needed.\n\nml.tree.DecisionTreeModel\n- Added toOld and made `private[spark]`, implemented for Classifier and Regressor in subclasses.  These methods now use OldInformationGainStats.invalidInformationGainStats for LeafNodes in order to mimic the spark.mllib implementation.\n\nml.tree.Node\n- Added `private[tree] def deepCopy`, used by unit tests\n\nCopied developer comments from spark.mllib implementation to spark.ml one.\n\nMoving unit tests\n- Tree learning internals were tested by spark.mllib.tree.DecisionTreeSuite, or spark.mllib.tree.RandomForestSuite.\n- Those tests were all moved to spark.ml.tree.impl.RandomForestSuite.  The order in the file + the test names are the same, so you should be able to compare them by opening them in 2 windows side-by-side.\n- I made minimal changes to each test to allow it to run.  Each test makes the same checks as before, except for a few removed assertions which were checking irrelevant values.\n- No new unit tests were added.\n- mllib.tree.DecisionTreeSuite: I removed some checks of splits and bins which were not relevant to the unit tests they were in.  Those same split calculations were already being tested in other unit tests, for each dataset type.\n\n**Changes of behavior** (to be noted in SPARK-13448 once this PR is merged)\n- spark.ml.tree.impl.RandomForest: Rather than throwing an error when maxMemoryInMB is set to too small a value (to split any node), we now allow 1 node to be split, even if its memory requirements exceed maxMemoryInMB.  This involved removing the maxMemoryPerNode check in RandomForest.run, as well as modifying selectNodesToSplit().  Once this PR is merged, I will note the change of behavior on SPARK-13448.\n- spark.mllib.tree.DecisionTree: When a tree only has one node (root = leaf node), the \"stats\" field will now be empty, rather than being set to InformationGainStats.invalidInformationGainStats.  This does not remove information from the tree, and it will save a bit of storage.\n","created_at":"2016-03-21T02:18:13Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T21:15:27Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T09:25:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de387b0127e9af3e226f28d21889b3d6cf1b01b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7bc7e6dfb65e64a7a39c8154cc0707a2bfbdd5f2","head":{"label":"jkbradley:remove-mllib-tree-impl","ref":"remove-mllib-tree-impl","sha":"7bc7e6dfb65e64a7a39c8154cc0707a2bfbdd5f2","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`Distinct` is an expensive operation. If possible, we should avoid it. This PR is to eliminate `Distinct` (the `Aggregate` for `Distinct`) when the child operators can guarantee the value uniqueness, \n\nFor example, in the following TPC-DS query 38, the left child of the first `Intersect` is `Distinct`, and thus, we can remove the top `Distinct` after converting `Intersect` to `Left-semi` + `Distinct`.\n\n``` SQL\nselect count(*) from (\n    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date\n    from store_sales, date_dim, customer\n          where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n      and store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk\n      and d_month_seq between [DMS] and [DMS] + 11\n  intersect\n    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date\n    from catalog_sales, date_dim, customer\n          where catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n      and catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk\n      and d_month_seq between [DMS] and [DMS] + 11\n  intersect\n    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date\n    from web_sales, date_dim, customer\n          where web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n      and web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk\n      and d_month_seq between [DMS] and [DMS] + 11\n) hot_cyst\n```\n\n**Note**: Since we do not have the cardinality info, we are unable to conclude if the distinct of the right child can be removed. It totally depends on the data of the right child of `Intersect`. In this PR, we just remove the top `Distinct`.\n\nUse a simplified query to show the effect of this PR:\n\n``` scala\ndf.distinct().intersect(df).intersect(df)\n```\n\nBefore the fix, the optimized plan is like\n\n``` SQL\nAggregate [id#37,value#38], [id#37,value#38]\n+- Join LeftSemi, Some(((id#37 <=> id#64) && (value#38 <=> value#65)))\n   :- Aggregate [id#37,value#38], [id#37,value#38]\n   :  +- Join LeftSemi, Some(((id#37 <=> id#57) && (value#38 <=> value#58)))\n   :     :- Aggregate [id#37,value#38], [id#37,value#38]\n   :     :  +- LocalRelation [id#37,value#38], [[id1,1],[id1,1],[id,1],[id1,2]]\n   :     +- LocalRelation [id#57,value#58], [[id1,1],[id1,1],[id,1],[id1,2]]\n   +- LocalRelation [id#64,value#65], [[id1,1],[id1,1],[id,1],[id1,2]]\n```\n\nAfter the fix, the optimized plan is like\n\n``` SQL\nJoin LeftSemi, Some(((id#37 <=> id#64) && (value#38 <=> value#65)))\n:- Join LeftSemi, Some(((id#37 <=> id#57) && (value#38 <=> value#58)))\n:  :- Aggregate [id#37,value#38], [id#37,value#38]\n:  :  +- LocalRelation [id#37,value#38], [[id1,1],[id1,1],[id,1],[id1,2]]\n:  +- LocalRelation [id#57,value#58], [[id1,1],[id1,1],[id,1],[id1,2]]\n+- LocalRelation [id#64,value#65], [[id1,1],[id1,1],[id,1],[id1,2]]\n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a few test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, **BooleanSimplification** optimization can handle the following cases.\n- a && (!a || b ) ==> a && b\n- a && (b || !a ) ==> a && b\n\nHowever, it can not handle the followings cases since those equations fail at the comparisons between their canonicalized forms.\n- a < 1 && (!(a < 1) || b)     ==> (a < 1) && b\n- a <= 1 && (!(a <= 1) || b) ==> (a <= 1) && b\n- a > 1 && (!(a > 1) || b)     ==> (a > 1) && b\n- a >= 1 && (!(a >= 1) || b) ==> (a >= 1) && b\n\nThis PR implements the above cases and also the followings, too.\n- a < 1 && ((a >= 1) || b )   ==> (a < 1) && b\n- a <= 1 && ((a > 1) || b )   ==> (a <= 1) && b\n- a > 1 && ((a <= 1) || b)  ==> (a > 1) && b\n- a >= 1 && ((a < 1) || b)  ==> (a >= 1) && b\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to support group by position in SQL. For example, when users input the following query\n\n``` SQL\nselect c1 as a, c2, c3, sum(*) from tbl group by 1, 3, c4\n```\n\nThe ordinals are recognized as the positions in the select list. Thus, `Analyzer` converts it to \n\n``` SQL\nselect c1, c2, c3, sum(*) from tbl group by c1, c3, c4\n```\n\nThis is controlled by the config option `spark.sql.groupByOrdinal`.\n- When true, the ordinal numbers in group by clauses are treated as the position in the select list.\n- When false, the ordinal numbers are ignored.\n- Only convert integer literals (not foldable expressions). If found foldable expressions, ignore them. \n- When the positions specified in the group by clauses correspond to the aggregate functions in select list, output an exception message.\n- star is not allowed to use in the select list when users specify ordinals in group by\n\nNote: This PR is taken from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10731. When merging this PR, please give the credit to @zhichao-li\n\nAlso cc all the people who are involved in the previous discussion:  @rxin @cloud-fan @marmbrus @yhuai @hvanhovell @adrian-wang @chenghao-intel @tejasapatil\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a few test cases for both positive and negative test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-03-20T04:19:21Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T04:58:14Z","closed_at":"2016-03-25T04:57:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b770cd6e3f3a4f2164475d4e620b15ef3b2a05d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11846/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11846/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11846/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d080095db685735ab2a5d7af62195fa072efeb2","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:groupByOrdinal","ref":"groupByOrdinal","sha":"6d080095db685735ab2a5d7af62195fa072efeb2","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPreviously, Dataset.groupBy returns a GroupedData, and Dataset.groupByKey returns a GroupedDataset. The naming is very similar, and unfortunately does not convey the real differences between the two.\n\nAssume we are grouping by some keys (K). groupByKey is a key-value style group by, in which the schema of the returned dataset is a tuple of just two fields: key and value. groupBy, on the other hand, is a relational style group by, in which the schema of the returned dataset is flattened and contain |K| + |V| fields.\n\nThis pull request also removes the experimental tag from RelationalGroupedDataset. It has been with DataFrame since 1.3, and we have enough confidence now to stabilize it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a rename to improve API understandability.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to add a new Optimizer rule for pruning Sort if its SortOrder is no-op.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`SessionCatalog`, introduced in #11750, is a catalog that keeps track of temporary functions and tables, and delegates metastore operations to `ExternalCatalog`. This functionality overlaps a lot with the existing `analysis.Catalog`.\n\nAs of this commit, `SessionCatalog` and `ExternalCatalog` will no longer be dead code. There are still things that need to be done after this patch, namely:\n- SPARK-14013: Properly implement temporary functions in `SessionCatalog`\n- SPARK-13879: Decide which DDL/DML commands to support natively in Spark\n- SPARK-?????: Implement the ones we do want to support through `SessionCatalog`.\n- SPARK-?????: Merge SQL/HiveContext\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is largely a refactoring task so there are no new tests introduced. The particularly relevant tests are `SessionCatalogSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13951\n1. Scala side `Pipeline` changes:\n   - Change `Param[Array[PipelineStage]]` to `StageArrayParam` to support Java competible function.\n2. Python side changes:\n   - wrapper: Add a `JavaConvertible` to support those stages that are not a `JavaWrapper`.\n   - wrapper: Add a `ConvertUtil` to support the Python-Scala converting for both `JavaWrapper` and `JavaConvertible`.\n   - pipeline: `Pipeline` and `PipelineModel` now extend from `JavaConvertible`.\n   - pipeline: `PipelineMLReader`, `PipelineMLWriter`, `PipelineModelMLReader`, and `PipelineModelMLWriter` now use `ConvertUtils`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTest with Python unit test for both pipeline save/load and nested-pipeline save/load.\n","created_at":"2016-03-18T23:03:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T19:13:38Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T19:13:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24c1984c7fa7022f2f379b29d30b3ea676df789a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a009902025d0ce954e049fd73fad73547757fff","head":{"label":"yinxusen:SPARK-13951","ref":"SPARK-13951","sha":"4a009902025d0ce954e049fd73fad73547757fff","user":{"login":"yinxusen","id":2637239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzcyMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2637239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen","html_url":"https://github.com/yinxusen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17233732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMzczMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"yinxusen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yinxusen","id":2637239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzcyMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2637239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen","html_url":"https://github.com/yinxusen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yinxusen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yinxusen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n[Spark Coding Style Guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Spark+Code+Style+Guide) has 100-character limit on lines, but it's disabled for Java since 11/09/15. This PR enables **LineLength** checkstyle again. To help that, this also introduces **RedundantImport** and **RedundantModifier**, too. The following is the diff on `checkstyle.xml`.\n\n``` xml\n-        <!-- TODO: 11/09/15 disabled - the lengths are currently > 100 in many places -->\n-        <!--\n         <module name=\"LineLength\">\n             <property name=\"max\" value=\"100\"/>\n             <property name=\"ignorePattern\" value=\"^package.*|^import.*|a href|href|http://|https://|ftp://\"/>\n         </module>\n-        -->\n         <module name=\"NoLineWrap\"/>\n         <module name=\"EmptyBlock\">\n             <property name=\"option\" value=\"TEXT\"/>\n@@ -167,5 +164,7 @@\n         </module>\n         <module name=\"CommentsIndentation\"/>\n         <module name=\"UnusedImports\"/>\n+        <module name=\"RedundantImport\"/>\n+        <module name=\"RedundantModifier\"/>\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCurrently, `lint-java` is disabled in Jenkins.
