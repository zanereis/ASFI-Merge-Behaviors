The following work was done in the following environment:\r\n\r\n   * os: https://hub.docker.com/r/tlcpack/ci-gpu\r\n   * tx-version: 0.14.3, py 3.6, x86_64\r\n\r\n1. Based on the previous information, prepare the basic environment to ensure that English documents can be generated normally.\r\n\r\n2. create gettext fold, where store the `*.pot` and `*.po` files. An automated script has been provided and you can do this easily.\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd docs/\r\n   ./generate_documents.sh true true false <language>\r\n\r\n   # for example:\r\n   ./generate_documents.sh true true false zh_CN   # for Simplified Chinese, You can find out how to use it at the end of the document.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The following types of `language` are supported:\r\n\r\n   * bn – Bengali\r\n   * ca – Catalan\r\n   * cs – Czech\r\n   * da – Danish\r\n   * de – German\r\n   * en – English\r\n   * es – Spanish\r\n   * fi – Finnish\r\n   * fr – French\r\n   * hr – Croatian\r\n   * it – Italian\r\n   * lt – Lithuanian\r\n   * nl – Dutch\r\n   * pl – Polish\r\n   * pt_BR – Brazilian Portuguese\r\n   * ru – Russian\r\n   * sl – Slovenian\r\n   * sv – Swedish\r\n   * tr – Turkish\r\n   * uk_UA – Ukrainian\r\n   * zh_CN – Simplified Chinese\r\n   * zh_TW – Traditional Chinese\r\n\r\n3. Translate documents directly by translating <*.po>, which is not recommended. We suggest a professional translation platform to implement multi-person collaborative translate-review. If you agree with our advice, you can skip this step. We will use <transifex.com> as an example to tell you how to deploy it.\r\n   \r\n   you can try to translate *.po in `translates/locales/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/`. Notice that `_staging/translates/locales` in fact is a soft-chain to `translates/locales`.\r\n\r\n4. Implement cooperative translation of <*.po> with the help of `transifex.com`. An automated script is also provided to help you simplify operations.\r\n\r\n   a. config the parameters in `docs/tx_transifex.sh` firstly.\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      POTDIR=\"translates/gettext\"                  # the *.pot fold. If you are not sure, default is recommended\r\n      LOCALESDIR=\"translates/locales\"              # the *.po fold, it can be unexist. If you are not sure, default is recommended\r\n      URLNAME=\"\"                                   # you can find it in your project in transifex.com, the same as the share-URL suffix.\r\n      LANGUAGE=\"\"                                  # the target language, \"zh_CN\" (Simplified Chinese) for example\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   b. init your transifex identity\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      cd docs/\r\n      ./tx_transifex.sh init                       # Please feel relaxed to kill the process(Ctrl^C) after input API token and finish verification.\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   c. update your transifex-config, which record the relation between `*.pot` and `*.po`\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      cd docs/\r\n      ./generate_documents.sh true true false <language>   # update your gettext(*.pot)\r\n\r\n      ./tx_transifex.sh update                             # update transifex-config\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   d. push your changes to transifex.com\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      cd docs/\r\n      ./tx_transifex.sh push\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n   e. pull the translated-po files to locale\r\n\r\n      ```bash\r\n      cd docs/\r\n      ./tx_transifex.sh pull\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n5. generate the html for Chinese.\r\n\r\n   We will automatically generate the sitemap(`$DOCS/_build/html_$LANGUAGE/*sitemap.xml`) for you, which is necessary if you expect your site to be detected by search engines like google.  We need you to specify the `ROOTURL` value in `docs/sitemaps/sitemap_generator/config.py`, which represents the url corresponding to the root of the website. If this is not helpful to you, you can skip this step. The default sitemap will still be generated, but it may not be valid.\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd docs/\r\n   ./generate_documents.sh false false true <language> # the _build/html_<language> will be created. you can directly deploy to your website.\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n6. some tips\r\n\r\n   If you are just updating the translation, do the following is enough:\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd docs/\r\n   ./tx_transifex.sh pull  # if you use <transifex.com> and do translation work remotely, or you can skip this command\r\n   ./generate_documents.sh false false true <language>\r\n

PR.\r\n\r\n@mei-ye Please confirm if this fixes the issue on windows.\r\n\r\ncc @mbrookhart @mbs-octoml @tmoreau89 \r\n\r\nOne issue with making `DeviceAnalyzer` inherit from `MixedModeVisitor` is the intermediate tuple in `call_lowered` op, as in\r\n```\r\n%0 = on_device(%x, constrain_body=False) /* from_string */ /* ty=Tensor[(128, 128), float32] */;\r\n%1 = on_device(%y, constrain_body=False) /*

/* from_string */ /* ty=Tensor[(128, 128), float32] */ \r\n```\r\nIf we do pure post-DFS traversal, the tuple will be visited before `call_lowered`, and that makes all original `CallNode` args unify to the domain of the tuple.

sets the builds for each platform to use [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) as a build cache. For a fully cached rebuild, this reduces the time (in testing) from 30+ minutes to 1-2 minutes (e.g. if the build isn't touching any C++ files). We can run this for a while and if it is successful then remove the extra code around rebuilding using the existing on-instance build directory.\r\n\r\nThe sccache server is backed by an S3 bucket

the PR add a simplify rule to allow patterns like floordiv(x*8+7, 16) => floordiv(x, 2). \r\n\r\nWe find the issue when using compute_at to `repeat` op:\r\n```python\r\nT_add = T.alloc_buffer([4],

started off with the test code in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/720e7b1ebd9b789a1100dee7536d0633c7941dd1/tests/python/contrib/test_gemm_acc32_vnni.py#L30 and simplified a bit. Autotvm tuning is supported but only one tunable param is exposed for now. I'm curious to know what kind of further scheduling would be worth it, beyond very simple ones I have now.\r\n\r\n Moreover, since I rely on alter op layout to enable this op (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/35f6bb1eaff3336a124e8544fe9f2cf97267867a/python/tvm/topi/x86/dense_alter_op.py#L40-L49) and currently this pass is disabled during autotvm (see https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/187aeb5fe813c5bffc81e88ba890399ce7d53e1e/python/tvm/autotvm/task/relay_integration.py#L52-L54 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10171), users need to manually invoke `AlterOpLayout` before extracting tasks. I refuse to add an ugly code path to workaround this strange issue like existing code cc @tkonolige. \r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @junrushao1994 @mbrookhart @tkonolige @elvin-n \r\n\r\n## Current perf results (also see more results in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10230#issuecomment-1039588965)\r\n\r\nCompare against FBGEMM using their bench exe https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/blob/main/bench/GEMMsBenchmark.cc\r\n\r\nThe CPU is `tigerlake i7-1195G7 @ 2.90GHz`, all numbers are giga ops per sec (GOPS).\r\n\r\nI didn't spend much on perf tuning, but the results look promising. Perf on bigger workloads don't look great, might need further investigation.\r\n\r\nAlso, I found that autotvm tuning (only one knob) helped on some single threaded perf, but it didn't on multi-threaded perf at all.  \r\n\r\nSingle thread\r\nM|N|K|TVM|FBGEMM\r\n-- | -- | -- | --| -- |\r\n64|    800|    320| 409.87859448066854| 267.4\r\n64|    768|    512| 393.2796314153642|

to end benchmarking](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8858) was added to the VM and graph executor in order to faithfully represent execution time by accounting for data transfer overheads. This can be particularly significant on discrete GPUs, where PCI-E transfers are important to account for in a typical model serving deployment.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to modify the default measurement done by TVMC to always benchmark end to end execution time from CPU local device context.\r\nAnother option is to expose in TVMC a flag that lets the user perform end to end benchmarking. I recommend however not benchmarking without data transfer overheads as it presents an overly optimistic outlook on TVM performance.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-11T19:02:52Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T17:37:07Z","closed_at":"2022-02-15T17:37:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02463e3c9bd77ea7db4b66a999d2938804ea2e97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10226/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10226/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10226/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/81b579c5a5b7c2cee4268c9de9ecf1b84e4fae4b","head":{"label":"tmoreau89:tvmc_benchmark_e2e","ref":"tvmc_benchmark_e2e","sha":"81b579c5a5b7c2cee4268c9de9ecf1b84e4fae4b","user":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119757672,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3NTc2NzI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tmoreau89/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tmoreau89","id":5974488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ0ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89","html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmoreau89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tmoreau89/tvm","description":"bring

to end benchmarking](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8858) was added to the VM and graph executor in order to faithfully represent execution time of a graph module in order to account for data transfer overheads. This can be particularly significant on discrete GPUs, where PCI-E transfers are important to account for in a typical model serving deployment.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to modify the default measurement done by TVMC to always benchmark end to end execution time from CPU local device context. \r\nAnother option is to expose in TVMC a flag that lets the user perform end to end benchmarking. I recommend however not benchmarking without data transfer overheads as it presents an overly optimistic outlook on TVM performance.","created_at":"2022-02-11T18:58:58Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T19:00:59Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T19:00:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"935ab09cacc67d3ffbffb01471e622ce4a9a8f1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"srkreddy1238","id":14215163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjE1MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14215163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238","html_url":"https://github.com/srkreddy1238","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srkreddy1238/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"siju-samuel","id":15828974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODI4OTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15828974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel","html_url":"https://github.com/siju-samuel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/siju-samuel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_ad

the `LowerThreadAllReduce` pass will only emit code that uses `shfl_down` when reduce extent equals warp size, when reduce extent is less than warp size, the codegen fall back to emit code that uses shared memory, which is not efficient.

The PR fix a problem when use `cache_write` after loop transformations. It may create out of bound accesses to external buffer without compiler warnings, which could be dangerous and hard to detect at immediate. The example to reproduce is as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\nfrom tvm import tir\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef f(x: T.handle)->None:\r\n    X = T.match_buffer(x, [28], \"int32\")\r\n    for i in range(28):\r\n        with T.block(\"block\"):\r\n            vi, = T.axis.remap(\"S\", [i])\r\n            X[vi] = 1\r\n\r\ns = tir.schedule.Schedule(f)\r\nblock = s.get_block(\"block\")\r\ni, = s.get_loops(block)\r\nii, io = s.split(i, factors=[None, 16])  # 28 % 16 != 0\r\ns.cache_write(block, 0, \"global\")\r\nprint(s.mod[\"main\"].script())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is:\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(X: T.Buffer[(28,), \"int32\"]) -> None:\r\n    X_global = T.alloc_buffer([32], dtype=\"int32\")\r\n    for i_0, i_1 in T.grid(2, 16):\r\n        with T.block(\"block\"):\r\n            vi = T.axis.spatial(28, i_0 * 16 + i_1)\r\n            T.where(i_0 * 16 + i_1 < 28)\r\n            X_global[vi] = 1\r\n    for ax0 in T.serial(32):\r\n        with T.block(\"X_global\"):\r\n            v0 = T.axis.spatial(32, ax0)\r\n            X[v0] = X_global[v0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse

on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10177, this adds parallel split-k support to wgrad. \r\n\r\n@comaniac @Laurawly  @junrushao1994 @vinx13 @YuchenJin @hwu36 @manishucsd\r\n\r\nSplit-k is described in https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/master/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md#parallelized-reductions.\r\nThis is my first experience using split-k in cutlass or any other API. Wgrad is particularly interesting for split-k since the implicit gemm K dimension is really large in wgrad (`N * P * Q` where `P` and `Q` are the output H and W). Without split-k, wgrad on large spatial inputs is extremely slow. \r\n\r\nFor now, I'm not trying anything smart to pick the split-k parameter, instead we ask users to provide possible candidates. I tuned over `[1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]` below and that already showed excellent performance. The benchmark code is [here](https://github.com/masahi/tvm-cutlass-eval/blob/master/conv2d/bench_cudnn.py#L337).\r\n\r\nBenchmark result against cuDNN. Note that currently there are non-trivial difference in cuDNN and TVM + cutlass outputs, especially for the larger batch size. I didn't find anything obviously wrong in the generated code and I gave up fixing accuracy difference at some point. Also note that difference is not due to parallel-split-k, even in a normal case the results were different (and actually improved after split-k lol).\r\n\r\n* [Batch size 8](https://gist.github.com/masahi/72c980cd86618999f296f20fe88d9bee)\r\n* [Batch size 256](https://gist.github.com/masahi/bd235805f8dcaedc21d664291e2f311c)\r\n\r\nThe result showed that cutlass winning across the board (`Profiler time` vs `cuDNN` columns, but again, the results do not match exactly). However, there is a serious problem when cutlass wgrad + split-k kernels are called from TVM (`TVM + CUTLASS` column): Split-k requires large workspace, and the space requirement grows linearly with `split-k-slices` parameter. Right now we naively allocate the workspace on *every* cutlass kernel call on each run, while for cuDNN we have a simple workspace memory reuse mechanism implemented in (together with a thread local storage) https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/211291fb9a59b5ca6aee6e83b7cd700f98463032/src/runtime/contrib/cudnn/cudnn_utils.cc#L153-L161. So during benchmarking, we run compiled TVM + CUTLASS 100 times, and each time we are allocating the same workspace :man_facepalming: while cuDNN allocates only once during algo selection outside of the profiling loop. This is causing huge perf penalty in TVM + cutlass results above.\r\n\r\nI attempted adding a simple workspace memory management in https://github.com/masahi/tvm/compare/cutlass-split-k...masahi:cutlass-workspace?expand=1, it kind of works in terms of the expected perf improvement. However, I'm getting segfault and other strange issues. I'm a bit confused as to what the right behavior should be for a thread local memory manager in the context of JIT- generated and compiled multiple translation units. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this issue. \r\n\r\n## Known issues and TODO\r\n- Accuracy alignment with cuDNN\r\n- Figure out workspace memory reuse\r\n- Split-k parameter selection strategy

support for offloading `conv2d_backward_weight` op to cutlass. Note that, since in wgrad the K dimension of the implicit GEMM is very large (`N * P * Q`), split-k is required for reasonable performance. I've already implemented split-k support as well, but sending basic wgrad support first. This includes layout conversion for `conv2d_backward_weight`, pattern matching, codegen and test cases.\r\n\r\nThe key diff in this PR is the introduction of the accumulation data type, which is now separate from output type. Since wgrad requires fp32 accumulation in practice, even if the output is fp16 we always accumulate in fp32. Note that cuDNN also supports only fp32 accum + fp16 output for wgrad. For GEMM and other conv2d ops, the accumulation type is set to the output dtype for now. \r\n\r\nAlso fixes the bug of `conv2d_backward_weight` not supporting depth wise conv2d as reported in

Use a.any() or a.all()\r\n```\r\n, which is because previously we used operator `==` to recognize the `tvm.script.tir` submodule. When `key` is `indptr`, `env[key]` will be `numpy.ndarray([0, 1, 2, 3])`. Comparing a `numpy.ndarray` with `tir` submodule using operator `==` leads to the error.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the error, we are supposed to use operator `is` for the comparison.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure how to add a suitable regression test 😐, and would like to ask for some idea to add a test.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao1994 @vinx13 @Hzfengsy @tqchen

Error message looks like `Check failed: stride.dtype() == base.dtype() (int32 vs. int64) :`. \r\n\r\n### The fix\r\n- During VectorizeLoop, a loop variable will be converted to a ramp but always of dtype `int32`. This PR changes it to use the loop variable's dtype. \r\n- During NarrowDataType, it can happen that the `stride `is inferred with `int32`, but `base` is not (see the added test case for detail). This PR adds an upcasting when rewriting a `Ramp` node that has `base` and `stride` inferred with different number of

a tuning task can be target-dependent, this PR adds target field to `MetaScheduleContext` and `ExtractedTask` to maintain target information. \r\n\r\ncc: @junrushao1994 @zxybazh \r\n\r\nI've also noticed that current database interface commits and query workload in target-agnostic fashion. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/python/unittest/test_meta_schedule_integration.py#L169-L173\r\nI think `workload` = `mod` + `target` in the same context with the change in this PR, but I would be happy to receive other inputs before I make the change.

in evolutionary search, meta schedule will keep sampling unmeasured schedules until it find `populaion_size `valid schedules in total. However, this algorithm is slow on gpu there will likely be many invalid schedules due to shared memory size constraints and thread number constraints. Hence, we only sample unmeasured schedules until it reaches a minimal size. In our experiments, doing so will not harm the performance, but it will accelerate the whole process a lot.\r\n\r\ncc: @Hzfengsy @junrushao1994

issue https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/10046 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/10088\r\n\r\nMain change:\r\nFor grouped convolutions, per channel quantization is only based on output channel. E.g. OIHW with shape [40, 20, 3, 3] would expect a scale tensor of shape [40]. Technically the original spec is more general but probably not common.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the requantize for per channel quantization erroneously used the batch dimension instead of channel dimension. This is now fixed. Note for onnx spec, QLinearConv assumes NCHW input\r\n\r\nNote, I can not get ONNX RT tests to work unfortunately :/ any guidance here would be

is a very strong constraint, which requires all the blocks in the sub-AST to be complete or reduction blocks. Currently, there are two primitives that use such property:\r\n- compute-at: the total scope is compact_dataflow. \r\n- parallel/bind/vectorize: the total scope is compact_dataflow. \r\n\r\nHowever, requiring all the scope to be `compact_dataflow` is too strict that some correct transformations are banned. (please see the added test cases). Here I updated the requirements:\r\n- compute-at: only requires the input block is complete or reduction\r\n- parallel/bind/vectorize:  only requires compact_dataflow under the input loop.\r\n\r\ncc

for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips. After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\nI'm reviewing this function after PR #10118, and found several buggy places. For instance, \r\n- it does not respect the original input tensor's layout but always reset it to the other input's layout (see `test_broadcast_respect_input_layouts`);\r\n- it assumes one can always only transform one layout to adapt to the other. However, this is not always possible, see `test_broadcast_non_adaptable`.\r\n- `AdjustSubordinateFactors` should also be called in the else branch https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/6a274af9cb4e7baf6d9dd06f0fb38bea5ac3154a/src/relay/transforms/infer_layout_utils.h#L222-L234. (see `test_alter_layout_nonscalar_broadcast`)\r\n\r\nThis PR rewrites `BinaryBroadcastLayoutHelper` a bit, and I tried to make it as backward compatible as possible.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\nBTW I seem to spot another bug when I was working on this PR. So I sometimes I need to create a scalar layout, and I used `Layout(\"\")`, but it returned an undefined layout. From the doc it should return a scalar layout right? I checked the constructor, and it seems in this if statement: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/6a274af9cb4e7baf6d9dd06f0fb38bea5ac3154a/src/tir/ir/data_layout.cc#L99, it directly returns without setting the `data_` field as in normal path: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/6a274af9cb4e7baf6d9dd06f0fb38bea5ac3154a/src/tir/ir/data_layout.cc#L144. I didn't fix this issue but work it around somehow, but it does seem like a bug to me

The slicing was done with negative strides and extremely large begin/end.

auto-marks all tensorflow frontend tests with `pytest.mark.forked`, which tells pytest to run each test in a subprocess rather than in the main test process. Hopefully this will help alleviate #10150 as the memory used should be released when the test subprocess ends.\r\n\r\nTested locally by running a tensorflow test then `ps -aef --forest` and confirming

the layout optimizer incorrectly assigning layouts for graphs with more complex topologies than previously considered. Specifically, this commit now ensures that intermediate layouts match (e.g. parent output = child input) and that all consumers are taken into account when altering the output layout - something not done previously due to an incorrect traversal order.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the input layout was always altered if the producer was an NPU operation without regard to the output layout of that operation. Additionally, is was possible for the output layout to be incorrectly set due to a depth-first post-order of traversal of the graph, meaning it was possible for not all consumers to be taken into account when altering the layout.\r\n\r\nNow the `AnalyzeConsumers` pass is run before `LayoutOptimization` which determines a mapping from NPU operation to list of boolean values that represent whether or not each consumer is an NPU operation. Since this is completed before `LayoutOptimization`, all consumers are guaranteed to be taken into account when altering the output layout. In turn, the input layouts can correctly be determined by checking whether the output of the producer will be altered.\r\n\r\ncc @mbaret @manupa-arm @ekalda @jacobbohlin @dchauhan-arm
