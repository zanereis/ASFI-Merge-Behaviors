What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe shuffle writer API introduced in SPARK-28209 has a flaw that leads to a memory usage regression - we ended up tracking the partition lengths in two places. Here, we modify the API slightly to avoid redundant tracking. The implementation of the shuffle writer plugin is now responsible for tracking the lengths of partitions, and propagating this back up to the higher shuffle writer as part of the commitAllPartitions API.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-02T23:48:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T16:22:25Z","closed_at":"2019-08-26T17:39:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0bbfa72934617e73d1895e42557596852c7c8040","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose new levels of truncations for the `date_trunc()` and `trunc()` functions: \r\n1. `MICROSECOND` and `MILLISECOND` truncate values of the `TIMESTAMP` type to microsecond and millisecond precision.\r\n2. `DECADE`, `CENTURY` and `MILLENNIUM` truncate dates/timestamps to lowest date of current decade/century/millennium.\r\n\r\nAlso the `WEEK` and `QUARTER` levels have been supported by the `trunc()` function.\r\n\r\nThe function is implemented similarly to `date_trunc` in PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-TRUNC to maintain feature parity with it.   \r\n\r\nHere are examples of `TRUNC`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT TRUNC('2015-10-27', 'DECADE');\r\n2010-01-01\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=true;\r\nspark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled\ttrue\r\nspark-sql> SELECT TRUNC('1999-10-27', 'millennium');\r\n1001-01-01\r\n```\r\nExamples of `DATE_TRUNC`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT DATE_TRUNC('CENTURY', '2015-03-05T09:32:05.123456');\r\n2001-01-01T00:00:00Z\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests to `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite` and `DateFunctionsSuite`, and uncommented existing tests in `pgSQL/date.sql`.","created_at":"2019-08-02T12:31:04Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:58:47Z","closed_at":"2019-08-09T04:34:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"099d80dd5a6ed65164d8b560f04c57149ef65ef3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dd6f092f5cbc94eacca91dc8b9caba6c6b01746e","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:date_truct-ext","ref":"date_truct-ext","sha":"dd6f092f5cbc94eacca91dc8b9caba6c6b01746e","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to keep consistency whenever UTF-8 charset is needed, as using `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` instead of using \"UTF-8\". If the String type is needed, `StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name()` is used.\r\n\r\nThis change also brings the benefit of getting rid of `UnsupportedEncodingException`, as we're providing `Charset` instead of `String` whenever possible.\r\n\r\nThis also changes some private Catalyst helper methods to operate on encodings as `Charset` objects rather than strings.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2019-08-02T06:38:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-07T13:45:33Z","closed_at":"2019-08-06T03:50:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5daf19b93e06d1f0ac8349f38423cbf313f717d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHere is the problem description from the JIRA.\r\n```\r\nWhen the inputs contain the constant 'infinity', Spark SQL does not generate the expected results.\r\n\r\nSELECT avg(CAST(x AS DOUBLE)), var_pop(CAST(x AS DOUBLE))\r\nFROM (VALUES ('1'), (CAST('infinity' AS DOUBLE))) v(x);\r\nSELECT avg(CAST(x AS DOUBLE)), var_pop(CAST(x AS

var_pop(CAST(x AS DOUBLE))\r\nFROM (VALUES ('-infinity'), ('infinity')) v(x);\r\n The root cause: Spark SQL does not recognize the special constants in a case insensitive way. In PostgreSQL, they are recognized in a case insensitive way. \r\n\r\nLink: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/datatype-numeric.html \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the casting code is enhanced to handle these `special` string literals in case insensitive manner.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in CastSuite and modified existing test suites.","created_at":"2019-08-01T21:09:25Z","updated_at":"2019-08-15T12:03:59Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T23:53:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76e1635263d3f806d368c22661f01b56cc8ed171","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a5d978707d519fc6cea5eb7caa1b3fe1eb4933f","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:double_infinity","ref":"double_infinity","sha":"1a5d978707d519fc6cea5eb7caa1b3fe1eb4933f","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for V2 catalogs and the V2SessionCatalog for V2 tables for saveAsTable.\r\nIf the table can resolve through the V2SessionCatalog, we use SaveMode for datasource v1 for backwards compatibility to select the code path we're going to hit.\r\n\r\nDepending on the SaveMode:\r\n - SaveMode.Append:\r\n     a) If table exists: Use AppendData.byName\r\n     b) If table doesn't exist, use CTAS (ignoreIfExists = false)\r\n - SaveMode.Overwrite: Use RTAS (orCreate = true)\r\n - SaveMode.Ignore: Use CTAS (ignoreIfExists = true)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to re-implement `DateTimeUtils`.`truncTimestamp` and use Java 8 time API to adjust timestamps to `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `QUARTER`, `WEEK`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE` and `SECOND`. This simplifies implementation and will allow to easily support other level of truncation, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28017. \r\n\r\nAlso I pass `ZoneId` instances to the function instead of `TimeZone` instances to avoid unnecessary conversions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy existing test suites. **I am going to re-run the `DateTime` benchmark.**","created_at":"2019-08-01T17:13:04Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T15:58:44Z","closed_at":"2019-08-05T07:32:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"895a7a9cca04138d232d9ed1ca41e1d5a1dc203f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a8008bc3014c683792dab82468f04d27ce0b13d4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:date_trunc","ref":"date_trunc","sha":"a8008bc3014c683792dab82468f04d27ce0b13d4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

This needs to query the hive metastore.\r\n2. In its `outputOrdering`, it needs to get all the files. This needs to query the hive metastore.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes by:\r\n1. `toString` do not need to report the number of partitions it reads. We should report it via SQL metrics.\r\n2. The `outputOrdering` is not very useful. We can only apply it if a) all the bucket columns are read. b) there is only one file in each bucket. This condition is really hard to meet, and even if we meet, sorting an already sorted file is pretty fast and avoiding the sort is not that useful.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-27677, the shuffle client not only handles the shuffle block but also responsible for local persist RDD blocks. For better code scalability and precise semantics(as the [discussion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24892#discussion_r300173331)), here we did several changes:\r\n\r\n- Rename ShuffleClient to BlockStoreClient. \r\n- Correspondingly rename the ExternalShuffleClient to ExternalBlockStoreClient, also change the server-side class from ExternalShuffleBlockHandler to ExternalBlockHandler. \r\n- Move MesosExternalBlockStoreClient to Mesos package.\r\n\r\nNote, we still keep the name of BlockTransferService, because the `Service` contains both client and server, also the name of BlockTransferService is not referencing shuffle client only.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UT.","created_at":"2019-08-01T15:03:12Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T05:22:53Z","closed_at":"2019-08-05T06:59:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"172efe77bf00cd76cb42dc72777c676b7d5ed083","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I want to use _BasicProfiler_ with different sorters in **sort_stats**, I sometimes need to create a custom profiler and implement the **show()** method only to replace the following line: `stats.sort_stats(\"time\", \"cumulative\").print_stats()`.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be better if the users are able to specify the sorters without creating a custom profiler.\r\n\r\nI implemented the changes in PySpark only.\r\n\r\nTo apply the **setter** and **getter** methods, one can use the following way:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nconf = SparkConf().set(\"spark.python.profile\", \"true\")\r\n\r\n# use BasicProfiler\r\nsc = SparkContext('local', 'test', conf=conf)\r\nsc.profiler_collector.profiler_cls.set_sort_stats_sorters(BasicProfiler, ['ncalls', 'tottime', 'name'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nplan to use unit test\r\n\r\nPlease review https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-01T11:07:51Z","updated_at":"2019-08-03T05:33:06Z","closed_at":"2019-08-03T05:33:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f07be6a0e38412e6bc2142b409fab3e02f2a0a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/10fbd0603fdcc257c555bc935da67b1584a42d32","head":{"label":"albertusk95:e/profiler","ref":"e/profiler","sha":"10fbd0603fdcc257c555bc935da67b1584a42d32","user":{"login":"albertusk95","id":12320188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIwMTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12320188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95","html_url":"https://github.com/albertusk95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":199583167,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTk1ODMxNjc=","name":"spark","full_name":"albertusk95/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"albertusk95","id":12320188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIwMTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12320188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95","html_url":"https://github.com/albertusk95","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertusk95/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/albertusk95/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24958 to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `AtomicReference` so that parent and child threads can access to the same file block holder.\r\n\r\nPython UDF expressions are turned to a plan and then it launches a separate thread to consume the input iterator. In the separate child thread, the iterator sets `InputFileBlockHolder.set` before the parent does which the parent thread is unable to read later.\r\n\r\n1. In this separate child thread, if it happens to call `InputFileBlockHolder.set` first without initialization of the parent's thread local (which is done when the `ThreadLocal.get()` is first called), the child thread seems calling its own `initialValue` to initialize.\r\n\r\n2. After that, the parent calls its own `initialValue` to initializes at the first call of `ThreadLocal.get()`.\r\n\r\n3. Both now have two different references. Updating at child isn't reflected to parent.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it via initializing parent's thread local with `AtomicReference` for file status so that they can be used in each task, and children thread's update is reflected.\r\n\r\nI also tried to explain this a bit more at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24958#discussion_r297203041.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unittest was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe mainly improve that i want to achieve is to help developers to explore the DAG information in the Web UI in complex flows. \r\nSometimes is very dificult to know what part of your spark plan corresponds to the DAG you are looking. \r\nThis is an initial improvement only in one simple spark plan type (UnionExec). \r\nIf you consider it a good idea, i want to extend it to other spark plans to improve the visualization iteratively.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe changes are tested manually in the web UI with an active job and in the history server, and have unit test\r\n\r\n![JobsView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12819544/62248163-be1e8800-b3e7-11e9-9fbe-b4ca7fdc0203.jpg)\r\n![StagesView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12819544/62248199-d393b200-b3e7-11e9-9753-2f58f27cb8b9.jpg)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-31T21:10:11Z","updated_at":"2019-08-04T03:25:44Z","closed_at":"2019-08-03T12:48:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ced7a1d418e69ab1d09553376a69d279e7e23d81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

issue is that the test tried to stop an existing scheduler and replace it with\r\na new one set up for the test. That can cause issues because both were sharing the\r\nsame RpcEnv underneath, and unregistering RpcEndpoints is actually asynchronous\r\n(see comment in Dispatcher.unregisterRpcEndpoint). So that could lead to races where\r\nthe new scheduler tried to register before the old one was fully unregistered.\r\n\r\nThe updated test avoids the issue by using a separate RpcEnv / scheduler instance\r\naltogether, and also avoids a misleading NPE in the test logs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-31T20:06:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T18:01:03Z","closed_at":"2019-08-01T00:49:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5e0a48207c9e56e5efb89f09eca19af74bf6bb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSubqueries do not have their own execution id, thus when calling `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.onUpdatePlan`, it will actually get the `QueryExecution` instance of the main query, which is wasteful and problematic. It could cause issues like stack overflow or dead locks in some circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by making `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` compare the `QueryExecution` object retrieved by current execution ID against the `QueryExecution` object from which this plan is created, and only update the UI when the two instances are the same.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests on TPC-DS

I can't find any database supports this syntax. I lost some reference of other database.\r\nThe usage maybe looks like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT t.*\r\nFROM course AS t\r\nWHERE UNIQUE(\r\n    SELECT r.course_id\r\n    FROM section AS r\r\n    WHERE t.course_id=r.course_id AND r.year = '2018'\r\n);\r\n```\r\nI have referenced the implement of `Exists` in Spark SQL. The rule `RewritePredicateSubquery` replace the `Exists` with a semi join between inner table and outer table.\r\nI have a basic idea use some rule replace `Unique-Predicate` with equivalent SQL.\r\nTake the above SQL as an example, the replaced SQL likes below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT t.*\r\nFROM course AS t\r\nINNER JOIN(\r\n   SELECT r.course_id AS course_id\r\n   FROM section AS r\r\n   WHERE r.year = '2018'\r\n   GROUP BY r.course_id\r\n   HAVING COUNT(r.course_id) = 1\r\n) AS b\r\nON t.course_id = b.course_id;\r\n```\r\nBut I don't know whether welcomed by everyone or not, I need some better thinking.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew UT\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-31T10:46:51Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T11:09:20Z","closed_at":"2019-08-05T05:06:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16eca8413e270bf0c23692544e95730c7d668bf1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb1ebbaff1cb9576714bb94fc04a717ad7908414","head":{"label":"beliefer:ansi-unique-predicate","ref":"ansi-unique-predicate","sha":"cb1ebbaff1cb9576714bb94fc04a717ad7908414","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d03ec65f01aa09b844fe9b4b362a8076ab84b4ee","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve the Github template for better and faster review iterations and better interactions between PR authors and reviewers.\r\n\r\nAs suggested in the the [dev mailing list](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-New-sections-in-Github-Pull-Request-description-template-td27527.html), this PR referred [Kubernates' PR template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).\r\n\r\nTherefore, those fields are newly added:\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n```\r\n\r\nand some comments were added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, many PR descriptions are poorly formatted, which causes some overheads between PR authors and reviewers.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple problems by those poorly formatted PR descriptions:\r\n\r\n- Some PRs still write single line in PR description with 500+- code changes in a critical path.\r\n- Some PRs do not describe behaviour changes and reviewers need to find and document.\r\n- Some PRs are hard to review without outlines but they are not mentioned sometimes.\r\n- Spark is being old and sometimes we need to track the history deep. Due to poorly formatted PR description,  sometimes it requires to read whole codes of whole commit histories to find the root cause of a bug.\r\n- Reviews take a while but the number of PR still grows.\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to alleviate the problems and situation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the PR templates when PRs are open. This PR uses the template this PR proposes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually tested via Github preview feature.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-31T06:44:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:30Z","closed_at":"2019-08-16T00:49:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7656a2a2286967089fca01d96c7184b6a2e60392","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROJECT%20INFRA","name":"PROJECT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` was partitioning the block fetches into two distinct sets: local reads and remote fetches. Within this PR (when the feature is enabled by \"spark.shuffle.readHostLocalDisk.enabled\") a new category is introduced: host-local reads. They are shuffle block fetches where although the block manager is different they are running on the same host along with the requester. \r\n\r\nMoreover to get the local directories of the other executors/block managers a new RPC message is introduced `GetLocalDirs` which is sent the the block manager master where it is answered as `BlockManagerLocalDirs`. In `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint` for answering this request the `localDirs` is extracted from the `BlockManagerInfo` and stored separately in a hash map called `executorIdLocalDirs`. Because the earlier used `blockManagerInfo` contains data for the alive block managers (see `org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerMasterEndpoint#removeBlockManager`).\r\n\r\nNow `executorIdLocalDirs` knows all the local dirs up to the application start (like the external shuffle service does) so in case of an RDD recalculation both host-local shuffle blocks and disk persisted RDD blocks on the same host can be served by reading the files behind the blocks directly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### Unit tests \r\n\r\n`ExternalShuffleServiceSuite`:\r\n- \"SPARK-27651: host local disk reading avoids external shuffle service on the same node\"\r\n\r\n`ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite`:\r\n- \"successful 3 local reads + 4 host local reads + 2 remote reads\"\r\n\r\nAnd with extending existing suites where shuffle metrics was tested.\r\n  \r\n### Manual tests\r\n\r\nRunning Spark on YARN in a 4 nodes cluster with 6 executors and having 12 shuffle blocks.   \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grep host-local experiment.log\r\n19/07/30 03:57:12 INFO storage.ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator: Getting 12 (1496.8 MB) non-empty blocks including 2 (299.4 MB) local blocks and 2 (299.4

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe latest docs http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html contains some description as below:\r\n\r\nspark.ui.showConsoleProgress | true | Show the progress bar in the console. The progress bar shows the progress of stages that run for longer than 500ms. If multiple stages run at the same time, multiple progress bars will be displayed on the same line.\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n\r\nBut the class `org.apache.spark.internal.config.UI` define the config `spark.ui.showConsoleProgress` as below:\r\n```\r\nval UI_SHOW_CONSOLE_PROGRESS = ConfigBuilder(\"spark.ui.showConsoleProgress\")\r\n    .doc(\"When true, show the progress bar in the console.\")\r\n

of #24960 to branch-2.3.\r\n\r\nThe issue is when self-join a cached view, only one side of join uses cached relation. The cause is in `ResolveReferences` we do deduplicate for a view to have new output attributes. Then in `AliasViewChild`, the rule adds extra project under a view. So it breaks cache matching.\r\n\r\nThe fix is when dedup, we only dedup a view which has output different to its child plan. Otherwise, we dedup on the view's child plan.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq.tabulate(5) { x => (x, x + 1, x + 2, x + 3) }.toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the basic catalog functionalities for JDBC v2, so that users can register a JDBC catalog and create/access JDBC tables directly.\r\n\r\nTo make the PR small, this PR introduces a data source v1 fallback API so that we don't need to implement `ScanBuilder` and `WriteBuilder` for JDBC v1 right now.\r\n\r\nNote that, this PR is orthogonal to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25211, which implements `ScanBuilder`, `WriterBuilder` for JDBC v2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThey are different when `n`/`len` is negative. So maybe need to change Spark to adapt  to Postgres's meaning.\r\n\r\nIn Postgres:\r\n```\r\nleft(str text, n int): Return first n characters in the string. When n is negative, return all but last |n| characters;\r\nright(str text, n int): Return last n characters in the string. When n is negative, return all but first |n| characters;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Spark:\r\n```\r\nleft(str, len) - Returns the leftmost `len`(`len` can be string type) characters from the string `str`,if `len` is less or equal than 0 the result is an empty string;\r\nright(str, len) - Returns the rightmost `len`(`len` can be string type) characters from the string `str`,if `len` is less or equal than 0 the result is an empty string. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pr is to support  negative length at LEFT/RIGHT SQL functions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd `Left / Right` unittest in `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.StringExpressionsSuite`;\r\n\r\ncc @wangyum

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we run the Kubernetes integration tests with `SPARK_HOME` already set, it refers the `SPARK_HOME` even when `--spark-tgz` is specified.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to unset `SPARK_HOME` to let the docker-image-tool script detect `SPARK_HOME`. Otherwise, it cannot indicate the unpacked directory as its home.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport SPARK_HOME=`pwd`\r\ndev/make-distribution.sh --pip --tgz -Phadoop-2.7 -Pkubernetes\r\nresource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh --deploy-mode docker-for-desktop --spark-tgz $PWD/spark-*.tgz\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ /.../spark/resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/target/spark-dist-unpacked/bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r docker.io/kubespark -t 650B51C8-BBED-47C9-AEAB-E66FC9A0E64E -p /.../spark/resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/target/spark-dist-unpacked/kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile build\r\ncp: resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles: No such file or directory\r\ncp: assembly/target/scala-2.12/jars: No such file or directory\r\ncp: resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/tests: No such file or directory\r\ncp: examples/target/scala-2.12/jars/*: No such file or directory\r\ncp: resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles: No such file or directory\r\ncp: resource-managers/kubernetes/docker/src/main/dockerfiles: No such file or directory\r\nCannot find docker image.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter some operations against Datasets and then persist them, Dataset.explain shows wrong result.\r\nOne of those operations is explain() itself.\r\nAn example here.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(10)\r\ndf.explain\r\ndf.persist\r\ndf.explain\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected result is like as follows.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n+- InMemoryTableScan [id#7L]\r\n      +- InMemoryRelation [id#7L], StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n            +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I got this.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is caused by `withCachedData` in `QueryExecution` is materialized early when `explain()` or such methods are called so this patch prevents it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdditional test cases in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSee discussion on the JIRA (and dev@). At heart, we find that math.log and math.pow can actually return slightly different results across platforms because of hardware optimizations. For the actual SQL log and pow functions, I propose that we should use StrictMath instead to ensure the answers are already the same. (This should have the benefit of helping tests pass on aarch64.)\r\n\r\nFurther, the atanh function (which is not part of java.lang.Math) can be implemented in a slightly different and more accurate way.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests (which will need to be changed).\r\nSome manual testing locally to understand the numeric issues.","created_at":"2019-07-28T13:49:09Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T21:29:14Z","closed_at":"2019-08-02T15:58:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8fa1413d48eff04806ae88054fd483aeddc41f4","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a0eed6d4a55829cd90a244cb130cb0eb75f46b3","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-28519","ref":"SPARK-28519","sha":"7a0eed6d4a55829cd90a244cb130cb0eb75f46b3","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

test tries to detect correct behavior in racy code, where the event\r\nthread is racing with the executor thread that's trying to kill the running\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nIf the event that signals the stage end arrives first, any delay in the\r\ndelivery of the message to kill the task causes the code to rapidly process\r\nelements, and may cause the test to assert. Adding a 10ms delay in\r\nLocalSchedulerBackend before the task kill makes the test run through\r\n~1000 elements. A longer delay can easily cause the 10000 elements to\r\nbe processed.\r\n\r\nInstead, by adding a small delay (10ms) in the test code that processes\r\nelements, there's a much lower probability that the kill event will not\r\narrive before the end; that leaves a window of 100s for the event\r\nto be delivered to the executor. And because each element only sleeps for\r\n10ms, the test is not really slowed down at all.","created_at":"2019-07-27T00:07:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T18:01:18Z","closed_at":"2019-07-27T18:11:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37608e6a38993b2f9db11b1af92d7498287c00d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to recover our K8s integration test suite by extending node affinity in order to pass `PVTestsSuite` in `DockerForDesktop` environment, too. Previously, `PVTestsSuite` fails at `--deploy-mode docker-for-desktop` option because the node affinity requires `minibase` node.\r\n\r\nFor `Docker Desktop`, there are two node names like the following. Note that Spark testing needs K8s v1.13 and above. So, this PR should be verified with `Docker Desktop (Edge)` version. This PR adds both because next stable `Docker Desktop` will have K8s v1.14.3.\r\n\r\n**Docker Desktop (Stable, K8s v1.10.11)**\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl get node\r\nNAME                 STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION\r\ndocker-for-desktop   Ready    master   52s   v1.10.11\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Docker Desktop 2.1.0.0 (Edge, K8s v1.14.3, Released 2019-07-26)**\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl get node\r\nNAME             STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION\r\ndocker-desktop   Ready    master   16h   v1.14.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins K8s integration test (`minibase`) and install `Docker Desktop 2.1.0.0 (Edge)` and run the integration test in `DockerForDesktop`. Note that this fixes only `PVTestsSuite`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dev/make-distribution.sh --pip --tgz -Phadoop-2.7 -Pkubernetes\r\n$ resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh --deploy-mode docker-for-desktop --spark-tgz $PWD/spark-*.tgz\r\n...\r\nKubernetesSuite:\r\n...\r\n- PVs with local

is implemented as a Java application and sometimes I'd like to apply Java options.\r\nOne situation I have met is the time I try to attach debugger to Launcher.\r\n\r\nLauncher is launched from bin/spark-class but there is no room to apply Java options.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild_command() {\r\n  \"$RUNNER\" -Xmx128m -cp \"$LAUNCH_CLASSPATH\" org.apache.spark.launcher.Main \"$@\"\r\n  printf \"%d\\0\" $?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsidering that it's not so many times to apply Java options to Launcher,  one compromise would just modify spark-class by user like as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild_command() {\r\n  \"$RUNNER\" -Xmx128m $SPARK_LAUNCHER_OPTS -cp \"$LAUNCH_CLASSPATH\" org.apache.spark.launcher.Main \"$@\"\r\n  printf \"%d\\0\" $?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't work when any text related to Java options is output to standard output because whole output is used as command-string for spark-shell and spark-submit in current implementation.\r\n\r\nOne example is jdwp. When apply agentlib option to use jdwp for debug, we will get output like as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nListening for transport dt_socket at address: 9876\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output shown above is not a command-string so spark-submit and spark-shell will fail.\r\nTo enable Java options for Launcher, we need treat command-string and others.\r\n\r\nI changed launcher/Main.java and bin/spark-class to print separator-character and treat it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually using Spark Shell with / without LAUNCHER_JAVA_OPTIONS like as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSPARK_LAUNCHER_OPTS=\"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=y,address=localhost:9876,server=y\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI did a post-hoc review of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25008 , and would like to propose some cleanups/fixes/improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Do not track the scanTime metrics in `ColumnarToRowExec`. This metrics is specific to file scan, and doesn't make sense for a general batch-to-row operator.\r\n2. Because of 2, we need to track scanTime when building RDDs in the file scan node.\r\n3. use `RDD#mapPartitionsInternal` instead of `flatMap` in several places, as `mapPartitionsInternal` is created for Spark SQL and we use it in almost all the SQL operators.\r\n4. Add `limitNotReachedCond` in `ColumnarToRowExec`. This was in the `ColumnarBatchScan` before and is critical for performance.\r\n5. Clear the relationship between codegen stage and columnar stage. The whole-stage-codegen framework is completely row-based, so these 2 kinds of stages can NEVER overlap. When they are adjacent, it's either a `RowToColumnarExec` above `WholeStageExec`, or a `ColumnarToRowExec` above the `InputAdapter`.\r\n6. Reuse the `ColumnarBatch` in `RowToColumnarExec`. We don't need to create a new one every time, just need to reset it.\r\n7. Do not skip testing full scan node in `LogicalPlanTagInSparkPlanSuite`\r\n8. Add back the removed tests in `WholeStageCodegenSuite`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

This happens because PythonBroadcast overrides the `finalize()` method to delete its data file. So, when GC happens and no  references on broadcast variable, it may trigger `finalize()` to delete \r\ndata file. That's also means, data under python Broadcast variable couldn't be deleted when `unpersist()`/`destroy()` called but relys on GC.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we removed the `finalize()` method, and map the PythonBroadcast data file to a BroadcastBlock(which has the same broadcast id with the broadcast variable who wrapped this PythonBroadcast) when PythonBroadcast is deserializing. As a result, the data file could be deleted just like other pieces of the Broadcast variable when `unpersist()`/`destroy()` called and do not rely on GC any more.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n \r\nAdded a Python test, and tested manually(verified create/delete the broadcast block).","created_at":"2019-07-26T13:55:06Z","updated_at":"2019-08-05T11:23:31Z","closed_at":"2019-08-05T11:23:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba557801e677788360711903559e20483fe7e022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently predicate subqueries (IN/EXISTS) are converted to Joins at the end of optimizer in RewritePredicateSubquery. This change moves the rewrite close to beginning of optimizer. The original idea was to keep the subquery expressions in Filter form so that we can push them down as deep as possible. One disadvantage is that, after the subqueries are rewritten in join form, they are not subjected to further optimizations. In this change, we convert the subqueries to join form early in the rewrite phase.  \r\n\r\nI will combine the pullupCorrelatedPredicates and RewritePredicateSubquery in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove the redundant and confusing transformImpl method in RF & GBT;\r\nIn `GBTClassifier` & `RandomForestClassifier`, the real `transform` methods inherit from `ProbabilisticClassificationModel` which can deal with multi output columns.\r\nThe `transformImpl` method, which deals with only one column - `predictionCol`, completely does nothing. This is quite confusing.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a back port of #23898.\r\n\r\nRunning Spark in Docker image with Alpine Linux 3.9.0 throws errors when using snappy. \r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced for example as follows: `Seq(1,2).toDF(\"id\").write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"DELETEME1\")` \r\nThe key part of the error stack is as follows `SparkException: Task failed while writing rows. .... Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/snappy-1.1.7-2b4872f1-7c41-4b84-bda1-dbcb8dd0ce4c-libsnappyjava.so: Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: Noded by /tmp/snappy-1.1.7-2b4872f1-7c41-4b84-bda1-dbcb8dd0ce4c-libsnappyjava.so)` \r\n\r\nThe source of the error appears to be that libsnappyjava.so needs ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 and looks for it in /lib, while in Alpine Linux 3.9.0 with libc6-compat version 1.1.20-r3 ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 is located in /lib64.\r\nNote: this issue is not present with Alpine Linux 3.8 and libc6-compat version 1.1.19-r10 \r\n\r\nA possible workaround proposed with this PR is to modify the Dockerfile by adding a symbolic link between /lib and /lib64 so that linux-x86-64.so.2 can be found in /lib. This is probably not the cleanest solution, but I have observed that this is what happened/happens already when using Alpine Linux 3.8.1 (a version of Alpine Linux which was not affected by the issue reported here).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by running a simple workload with spark-shell, using docker on a client machine and using Spark on a Kubernetes cluster. The test workload is: `Seq(1,2).toDF(\"id\").write.format(\"parquet\").save(\"DELETEME1\")` \r\n\r\nAdded a test to the KubernetesSuite /

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe flag `spark.sql.decimalOperations.nullOnOverflow` is not honored by the `Cast` operator. This means that a casting which causes an overflow currently returns `null`.\r\n\r\nThe PR makes `Cast` respecting that flag, ie. when it is turned to false and a decimal overflow occurs, an exception

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Spark's own GetFunctionsOperation which mitigates the differences between Spark SQL and Hive UDFs. But our implementation is different from Hive's implementation:\r\n- Our implementation always returns results. Hive only returns results when [(null == catalogName || \"\".equals(catalogName)) && (null == schemaName || \"\".equals(schemaName))](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/release-3.1.1/service/src/java/org/apache/hive/service/cli/operation/GetFunctionsOperation.java#L101-L119). \r\n- Our implementation pads the `REMARKS` field with the function usage - Hive returns an empty string.\r\n- Our implementation does not support `FUNCTION_TYPE`, but Hive does.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn adaptive query processing (AQE), query plans are optimized on the fly during execution. However, a few `Once` rules can be problematic for such optimization since they can either generate wrong plan/unnecessary intermediate plan nodes.\r\n\r\nThis PR enforces idempotence for \"Once\" batches that are supposed to run once. This is a key enabler for AQE re-optimization and can improve robustness for existing optimizer rules.\r\n\r\nOnce batches that are currently not idempotent are marked in a blacklist. We will submit followup PRs to fix idempotence of these rules.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs. Failing Once rules are temporarily blacklisted.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-24T21:45:12Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T18:01:11Z","closed_at":"2019-07-26T06:49:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1e4b2a283b1820e20ee34cb6d60c6321374c781","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02e17006654b2e010b6867a7b20a583b9b0e30ed","head":{"label":"yeshengm:idempotence-checker","ref":"idempotence-checker","sha":"02e17006654b2e010b6867a7b20a583b9b0e30ed","user":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187889692,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc4ODk2OTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"yeshengm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeshengm","id":12269969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY5OTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12269969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm","html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeshengm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeshengm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a backport of SPARK-28152 to Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\nSPARK-28152 PR aims to correct mappings in `MsSqlServerDialect`. `ShortType` is mapped to `SMALLINT` and `FloatType` is mapped to `REAL` per [JBDC mapping]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/using-basic-data-types?view=sql-server-2017) respectively.\r\n\r\nShortType and FloatTypes are not correctly mapped to right JDBC types when using JDBC connector. This results in tables and spark data frame being created with unintended types. The issue was observed when validating against SQLServer.\r\n\r\nRefer [JBDC mapping]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/using-basic-data-types?view=sql-server-2017  ) for guidance on mappings between SQLServer, JDBC and Java. Note that java \"Short\" type should be mapped to JDBC \"SMALLINT\" and java Float should be mapped to JDBC \"REAL\".\r\n\r\nSome example issue that can happen because of wrong mappings\r\n    - Write from df with column type results in a SQL table of with column type as INTEGER as opposed to SMALLINT.Thus a larger table that expected.\r\n    - Read results in a dataframe with type INTEGER as opposed to ShortType\r\n\r\n- ShortType has a problem in both the the write and read path\r\n- FloatTypes only have an issue with read path. In the write path Spark data type 'FloatType' is correctly mapped to JDBC equivalent data type 'Real'. But in the read path when JDBC data types need to be converted to Catalyst data types ( getCatalystType) 'Real' gets incorrectly gets mapped to 'DoubleType' rather than 'FloatType'.\r\n\r\nRefer #28151 which contained this fix as one part of a larger PR.  Following PR #28151 discussion it was decided to file seperate PRs for each of the fixes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnitTest added in JDBCSuite.scala and these were tested.\r\nIntegration test updated and passed in MsSqlServerDialect.scala\r\nE2E test done with SQLServer","created_at":"2019-07-24T19:09:20Z","updated_at":"2020-01-13T05:36:03Z","closed_at":"2019-07-25T02:36:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9de77365b7f5419f075586b4ac4775a7a211d75b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25248/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25248/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25248/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3020b26e5e20dc7eda3d7aff319c087fee0cf3b","head":{"label":"shivsood:PR_28152_2.4","ref":"PR_28152_2.4","sha":"a3020b26e5e20dc7eda3d7aff319c087fee0cf3b","user":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192983938,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI5ODM5Mzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"shivsood/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shivsood","id":1579057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzkwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1579057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood","html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shivsood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shivsood/spark","description":"Apache
