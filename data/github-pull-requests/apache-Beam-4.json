two Java Bundle Finalization tests.\r\n\r\n* Fix potential for fused transforms to flip finalization state of a stage. If any transform requires finalization, then so does the entire stage.\r\n* Fix the tests themselves: They were making assumptions on bundle production outside of the needs of the tests.\r\n  * Reduce the \"attempts\" count, since they should now play better with other runners as well.\r\n* Remove unnecessary impulse kick set for TestStream. This plays better with Side input validation.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Adds support for bounded trie in Dataflow legacy workers.\r\n- Streaming reports delta counters. This is essential because without it streaming will end up remaining same counters as cumulative through it's entire lifespan. This will be bad even with bounded trie which is self-limiting in size because in backend the level db monitoring writer keeps taking snapshot of counters on publish and writing to level db and for a long running job even with self-limiting data store the file sizes will keep growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

was a bug with pipeline-level windowing with transforms that define `error_handling` in which pipelines would fail with error:\r\n```\r\nAmbiguous output at line 16: Stream has outputs [None, 'errors']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was due to a check to ensure a transform only outputs a \"good\" collection and optionally a collection defined by the named output in the `error_handling` config. Since the `error_handling` was not propagated to the top-level composite constructed as part of pipeline-level windowing, the check would fail.\r\n\r\nExample affected pipeline:\r\n```\r\npipeline:\r\n  transforms:\r\n    - type: ReadFromPubSub\r\n      name: Stream\r\n      config:\r\n        topic: projects/pubsub-public-data/topics/taxirides-realtime\r\n        format: json\r\n        schema:\r\n          type: object\r\n          properties:\r\n            ride_id: {type: string}\r\n        error_handling:\r\n          output: errors\r\n    - type: LogForTesting\r\n      name: Log messages\r\n      input: Stream\r\n    - type: LogForTesting\r\n      name: Log errors\r\n      config:\r\n        level: INFO\r\n      input: Stream.errors\r\n  windowing:\r\n    type: fixed\r\n    size: 60\r\noptions:\r\n  streaming: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR closes #32167 via implementation of a worker.MultiplexW to forward FnAPI gRPC requests to *W stored by id that matches the worker-id gRPC context metadata. In addition to typical go test workflow, to validate this PR `./gradlew :runners:portability:java:ulrLoopbackValidatesRunnerTests -PjobEndpoint=localhost:8073` was ran on a few initial tests. The `idle_shutdown_timeout` was tested by visual inspection to validate the additional service does not block the executable from shutting down.\r\n\r\nDepends on PR https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/33453\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-opaque for details on Opaque Protocol Buffers for Go.\r\n\r\n* genproto.sh has been updated to force generation of the Hybrid API, which is compatible with the new Opaque API.\r\n  * This required updating the Go proto plug in, which now reserves comments properly, simplifying the script.\r\n* The Go protocol buffers were regenerated. This yields the compatible APIs, such as accessor and setter methods and builder structs.\r\n* The open2opaque migration tool was run, and the fewer than a dozen spots that required manual intervention were fixed.\r\n\r\nThis PR has no functional changes, and is almost entirely generated.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

will fail with a JSON serialization error for fields that are of type `bytes` (since JSON has no such concept), so transforms like ReadFromPubSub (using RAW format) will fail. This refactor will print the bytes as-is to help with debuggability without the use of an intermediate MapToFields (which may not be obvious if the user does not know the upstream transform insert a bytes field into the output Row).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

mechanisms should continue to work with this change since we convert those to the correct types in this PR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.69.2</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/experimental: add type aliases for symbols (<code>Metrics</code>/etc) that were moved to the stats package (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7929\">#7929</a>).</li>\n<li>client: set user-agent string to the correct version.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release 1.69.0</h2>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The recently added <code>grpc.NewClient</code> function is incompatible with forward proxies, because it resolves the target hostname on the client instead of passing the hostname to the proxy. A fix is expected to be a part of grpc-go v1.70. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7556\">#7556</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/opentelemetry: Introduce new APIs to enable OpenTelemetry instrumentation for metrics on servers and clients (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7874\">#7874</a>)</li>\n<li>xdsclient: add support to fallback to lower priority servers when higher priority ones are down (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7701\">#7701</a>)</li>\n<li>dns: Add support for link local IPv6 addresses (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7889\">#7889</a>)</li>\n<li>The new experimental <code>pickfirst</code> LB policy (disabled by default) supports Happy Eyeballs, interleaving IPv4 and IPv6 address as described in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305#section-4\">RFC-8305 section 4</a>, to attempt connections to multiple backends concurrently. The experimental <code>pickfirst</code> policy can be enabled by setting the environment variable <code>GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_NEW_PICK_FIRST</code> to <code>true</code>.

(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7869\">#7869</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/isgj\"><code>@​isgj</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>balancer/weightedroundrobin: use the <code>pick_first</code> LB policy to manage connections (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7826\">#7826</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>API Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>balancer: An internal method is added to the <code>balancer.SubConn</code> interface to force implementors to embed a delegate implementation.

The errors are viewable in the Docker Daemon logs and exported to traces when tracing is configured. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48842\">moby/moby#48842</a></li>\n<li>When reading log files, compressed log files are now only decompressed when needed rather than decompressing all files before starting the log stream. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48842\">moby/moby#48842</a></li>\n<li>Fix an issue that meant published ports from one container on a bridge network were not accessible from another container on the same network with <code>userland-proxy</code> disabled, if the kernel's <code>br_netfilter</code> module was not loaded and enabled. The daemon will now attempt to load the module and enable <code>bridge-nf-call-iptables</code> or <code>bridge-nf-call-ip6tables</code> when creating a network with the userland proxy disabled. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48685\">moby/moby#48685</a></li>\n<li>Fix loading of <code>bridge</code> and <code>br_netfilter</code> kernel modules. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48966\">moby/moby#48966</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Fix Docker daemon failing to fully start with a &quot;context deadline exceeded error&quot; with containerd snapshotter and many builds/images. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48954\">moby/moby#48954</a></li>\n<li>containerd image-store: Fix partially pulled images not being garbage-collected. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48910\">moby#48910</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48957\">moby/moby#48957</a></li>\n<li>containerd image store: Fix <code>docker image inspect</code> outputting duplicate references in <code>RepoDigests</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48785\">moby/moby#48785</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
