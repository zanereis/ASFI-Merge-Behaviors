What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nthis pr works for RIP-16. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- add request interface to producer;\r\n- add ReplyMessageProcessor in broker to support request-response model;\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n[ISSUE 504](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/504).\r\n\r\n”No route info of this topic“ exception is a classic problem for rocketmq beginners.\r\n\r\nIf no route data of the topic is retrieved from name server, this exception will be thrown. However, in many cases, the lack of routedata in nameserver is not the real cause, such as the following situations：\r\n\r\n1. No nameserver address is set.\r\n2. Network problems (Producer can't connect to nameserver, such as firewall).\r\n3. Netty version issue.\r\n\r\nThe real exceptions are written to the log, and 'no route info of this topic' is thrown to console, which mislead the users. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThis PR polish exception of  'no route info of this topic'. It will throw more specific exceptions to users. For example, due to network problems, the route data fails to be obtained, and the wrapped remotingXXXXXException is directly thrown to users and users can locate the problem according to exception chaining.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #1375\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nModify TransactionalMessageBridge.java, add ```msgInner.setSysFlag(MessageSysFlag.clearCompressedFlag(msgInner.getSysFlag()));``` to clear compressed flag of half message.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUse TransactionMQProducer and send messages larger than 4KB, see if the issue occurs.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWork for the [issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/1388), add lite pull consumer support for RocketMQ\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd lite pull consumer support for RocketMQ：\r\n(1) Support consume messages in subscribe way with auto rebalance.\r\n(2) Support consume messages in assign way with no auto rebalance support.\r\n(3) Add seek/commit offset for a specified message queue.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T09:02:41Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T02:23:44Z","closed_at":"2019-08-22T13:07:19Z","merged_at":"2019-08-22T13:07:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"9edeb4ecd8ec22920f751b480a7a24ab40dde361","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":954854570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTQ4NTQ1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/new%20feature","name":"type/new

What is the purpose of the change\r\nSet `ackIndex` by yourself when `consumeMessage` return `RECONSUME_LATER`.\r\n#1382\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIf `consumeMessage` pull a batch of messages and one of them throw an exception, `consumeMessage` will return `RECONSUME_LATER`. `ConsumeMessageCurrentlyService` will receive this status, and send back this batch of messages. If you want to control number of messages that should be sent back, you can set `ackIndex` property by `consumer.setAckIndex(index)`. Actually, if you still want old feature, don't use `consumer.setAckIndex()`.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T07:47:50Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T08:50:57Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T08:50:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b131cf9edda639087658f2afcaff9aa8688d10d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/wontfix","name":"type/wontfix","color":"dd61cb","default":false,"description":"Stale

your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-13T02:27:39Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T17:15:16Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T07:08:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57007a981976497be36af87be49872bd40f04d04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1376/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1376/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1376/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/7ed8c16be29e68713b26ea2efb4db9a54d3b3f87","head":{"label":"Lunaticf:master","ref":"master","sha":"7ed8c16be29e68713b26ea2efb4db9a54d3b3f87","user":{"login":"Lunaticf","id":16462775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDYyNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16462775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunaticf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":173526957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzM1MjY5NTc=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"Lunaticf/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunaticf","id":16462775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDYyNzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16462775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunaticf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunaticf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunaticf/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

 Replace StringBuffer with StringBuilder inside the method\r\nUsing `StringBuilder` is more efficient than using `StringBuffer ` without thinking about thread safety. Therefore this PR replace StringBuffer with StringBuilder inside the method.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd the support of IPv6\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Modified the message system flag to indicate which IP protocol the client and broker itself came from.\r\n- Modified the method of generating and decoding msgID\r\n- Modified the class related to message storage and decoding\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d4GXH0pdwQiUgzlwqJqWLmR5Punz6GG0RvMP0IgHvbM/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [1] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #1344 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. If the current OS is Darwin, create ```RAMDisk``` as the substitute for ```/dev/shm``` to store gc log. On other systems, check if  ```/dev/shm``` exists. If ```/dev/shm``` does not exist, store gc log in ```${BASE_DIR}```.\r\n\r\n2. Correct and unify the gc log file name.\r\n\r\n3. Use ```UseGCLogFileRotation``` in ```runserver.sh``` because name service is also a long-lived service process\r\n\r\nmodified:   distribution/benchmark/runclass.sh\r\nmodified:   distribution/bin/runbroker.sh\r\nmodified:   distribution/bin/runserver.sh\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nStart the name service and broker on the MacOS and Linux Systems\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n  make  RocketMQ to support to send batch message when change to  DLedger mode \r\n\r\n\r\nBrief changelog\r\n\r\nWe serialize the batch message to single message and add them to a list . Then Cyclicing get the message to use DLedgercommitlog append the message . \r\nImplement the \"putMessages(final MessageExtBatch messageExtBatch)\"  method \r\nadd the \"serialize(final MessageExtBatch messageExtBatch)\" method \r\n\r\nVerifying this change\r\n\r\n add an unit test to verifying the function and we test it in our testing environment \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-18T02:37:45Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T07:42:01Z","closed_at":"2019-07-25T07:42:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e139ef81c75539a4608472e33dafa8c223d9de31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/1cf114fde74a10e8dc95e43e1d2090625d17e745","head":{"label":"qqeasonchen:qqeasonchen-rocketmq-2","ref":"qqeasonchen-rocketmq-2","sha":"1cf114fde74a10e8dc95e43e1d2090625d17e745","user":{"login":"qqeasonchen","id":26195189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTk1MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26195189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen","html_url":"https://github.com/qqeasonchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197360771,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTczNjA3NzE=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"qqeasonchen/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qqeasonchen","id":26195189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTk1MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26195189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen","html_url":"https://github.com/qqeasonchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qqeasonchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qqeasonchen/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

change\r\n\r\n无需验证\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n#1308\r\nFix some spelling errors of method names in file named 'UtilAll.java'\r\n\r\nThese changes seem trivial, but it's an international project and I think the right naming helps other developers understand it.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nthe UtilAll.computeEclipseTimeMilliseconds was modified to UtilAll.computeElapsedTimeMilliseconds\r\n(I think this method is to calculate the elapsed time by giving the start time.)\r\n\r\n'computNextMorningTimeMillis' was modified to 'computeNextMorningTimeMillis '\r\n\r\n'computNextHourTimeMillis' was modified to 'computeNextHourTimeMillis '\r\n\r\n'computNextMinutesTimeMillis' was modified to 'computeNextMinutesTimeMillis '\r\n\r\n'computNextHalfHourTimeMillis' was modified to 'computeNextHalfHourTimeMillis '\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA small optimization to reduce the probability of full traversal in BlockingQueue.remove() when cleaning expired request. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nBlockingQueue.remove() is thread-safe and occupies full lock during execution. \r\nWhen the expired cleaner try to remove a expired request which is already token by the thread pool's executor, an unnecessary full traversal occurs in BlockingQueue.remove().\r\nIn this optimization, expired cleaner trys to cancel the task with CAS before removing it from queue in order to reduce the probability of unnecessary remove option.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-05T15:53:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T12:40:14Z","closed_at":"2019-09-16T12:40:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a35e307ca2945c86ca5d4bf5d97d292e422e2d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/bf72446667b690fb2a707088eb9e305da9aaf9d5","head":{"label":"StrigiformesCoder:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"bf72446667b690fb2a707088eb9e305da9aaf9d5","user":{"login":"StrigiformesCoder","id":31011967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDExOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31011967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder","html_url":"https://github.com/StrigiformesCoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI3OTc0MjE=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"StrigiformesCoder/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"StrigiformesCoder","id":31011967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDExOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31011967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder","html_url":"https://github.com/StrigiformesCoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrigiformesCoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/StrigiformesCoder/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [√] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [√] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #1290] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [√] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

version \"1.8.0_51\"\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-22T01:31:55Z","updated_at":"2019-06-22T01:32:22Z","closed_at":"2019-06-22T01:32:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11fae4d8786ae34e2ef3d903b7ab9e4ee2eac5ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/1f73a35361675d6ba678b0c7558ffe66e46fa7c6","head":{"label":"todorex:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f73a35361675d6ba678b0c7558ffe66e46fa7c6","user":{"login":"todorex","id":18597576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk3NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18597576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex","html_url":"https://github.com/todorex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189122065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxMjIwNjU=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"todorex/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"todorex","id":18597576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk3NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18597576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex","html_url":"https://github.com/todorex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/todorex/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-22T01:08:04Z","updated_at":"2019-06-22T01:39:15Z","closed_at":"2019-06-22T01:39:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b12b601bbb328f75ddf7728a4798e05a4b295cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/1f73a35361675d6ba678b0c7558ffe66e46fa7c6","head":{"label":"todorex:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f73a35361675d6ba678b0c7558ffe66e46fa7c6","user":{"login":"todorex","id":18597576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk3NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18597576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex","html_url":"https://github.com/todorex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189122065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODkxMjIwNjU=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"todorex/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"todorex","id":18597576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk3NTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18597576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex","html_url":"https://github.com/todorex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/todorex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/todorex/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-20T01:25:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T11:40:20Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T11:40:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14738fe49bfde823715d583fb388505eda228f5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1276/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1276/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1276/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/578c559ff575e53ffdd3f4e4009342559b541e7d","head":{"label":"finalcola:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"578c559ff575e53ffdd3f4e4009342559b541e7d","user":{"login":"finalcola","id":27013879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDEzODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27013879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola","html_url":"https://github.com/finalcola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":178840246,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzg4NDAyNDY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"finalcola/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finalcola","id":27013879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDEzODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27013879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola","html_url":"https://github.com/finalcola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finalcola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finalcola/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nDelay plant log appender in client logger\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

in my local enviroments.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-15T06:35:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-18T01:36:05Z","closed_at":"2019-06-17T11:02:18Z","merged_at":"2019-06-17T11:02:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"bf2a7e51080044af6e8ec0956f6858b9ea37ea70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"duhenglucky","id":7938968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Mzg5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7938968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky","html_url":"https://github.com/duhenglucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhenglucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/11/labels","id":4400989,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDQwMDk4OQ==","number":11,"title":"4.5.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"ShannonDing","id":16487356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16487356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing","html_url":"https://github.com/ShannonDing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-12T11:59:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T06:50:21Z","due_on":"2019-08-10T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T06:50:21Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/8ec929d888a9cdf2bd4722abae5096cf2628b4a8","head":{"label":"kexianjun:dev-fix-typo","ref":"dev-fix-typo","sha":"8ec929d888a9cdf2bd4722abae5096cf2628b4a8","user":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139403178,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk0MDMxNzg=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"kexianjun/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kexianjun","id":12162539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYyNTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12162539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun","html_url":"https://github.com/kexianjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kexianjun/followers",

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix typo\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-13T13:45:11Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T02:09:30Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T13:55:40Z","merged_at":"2019-06-13T13:55:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"cd473fed3bd48c82167f3190d18666e9f1722a24","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/11","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/11","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/11/labels","id":4400989,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDQwMDk4OQ==","number":11,"title":"4.5.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"ShannonDing","id":16487356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDg3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16487356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing","html_url":"https://github.com/ShannonDing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShannonDing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":34,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-06-12T11:59:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T06:50:21Z","due_on":"2019-08-10T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T06:50:21Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1256/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1256/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1256/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/a49e425365a91c8e67f799535d0fa74b62b7029f","head":{"label":"zihengCat:ziheng_dev","ref":"ziheng_dev","sha":"a49e425365a91c8e67f799535d0fa74b62b7029f","user":{"login":"zihengCat","id":19472493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDcyNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19472493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat","html_url":"https://github.com/zihengCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189912986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODk5MTI5ODY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"zihengCat/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zihengCat","id":19472493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDcyNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19472493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat","html_url":"https://github.com/zihengCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zihengCat/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

drain out all ack-timeout messages to do resend.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [√] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [√] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [√] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T09:53:25Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T07:14:31Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T02:18:03Z","merged_at":"2019-06-05T02:18:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"53a15b63238b3fcdbbb9495f2ae57f460558f83f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/f0ad359ca15f2f7671a53c35f0550825e7404b0f","head":{"label":"xiangwangcheng:mqtt","ref":"mqtt","sha":"f0ad359ca15f2f7671a53c35f0550825e7404b0f","user":{"login":"xiangwangcheng","id":8049014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDkwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8049014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangwangcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155711251,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTU3MTEyNTE=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"xiangwangcheng/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiangwangcheng","id":8049014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDkwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8049014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/xiangwangcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiangwangcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiangwangcheng/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

changelog\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T02:13:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T13:37:12Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T13:32:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"910739c1ea057e3de45a479f816ec085e9185469","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543182,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1242/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/1242/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/1242/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b567f3533475bda3f4bae74c1f4df4844737e3f3","head":{"label":"zihengCat:ziheng_dev","ref":"ziheng_dev","sha":"b567f3533475bda3f4bae74c1f4df4844737e3f3","user":{"login":"zihengCat","id":19472493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDcyNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19472493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat","html_url":"https://github.com/zihengCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":189912986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODk5MTI5ODY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"zihengCat/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zihengCat","id":19472493,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDcyNDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19472493?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat","html_url":"https://github.com/zihengCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zihengCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zihengCat/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nmqtt feature implementation\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. add the logic of pulling messages(batch) from enode\r\n2. add the logic of pushing offline messages when reconnected\r\n3. add test case(unfinished)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [√] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [√] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [√] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [√] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [√] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
