SUMMARY\r\nWhen creating a new migration, I was confused because the `down_revision` didn't match any of the migration files that existed. Turned out the revision hash didn't match the filename for this migration, so i'm renaming the file to match. This _should_ be a safe change since the revision number is remaining the same, only the file name is changing.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nThe aim of this PR was to create foundations for new native filters' feature: time filters.\r\nUser can choose between one more filter type, which is Time.\r\n\r\nThat's the basics for this feature. What should be added in next PRs:\r\n- UI improvements (if we want to show modal in modal, how to display very long time \"pills\" in Filter Bar etc.)\r\n- Improve Filter Config Modal validation - right now datasource is required, but in case of time filters it should not\r\n- Implement additional filtering: i.e. inverse\r\n- Might also take a look on performance - it take more time to show time filters result than select filters result\r\n- Filter indicator logic needs to be updated\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

\"DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS\": True,`\r\nGo to dashboard and create native filters with filter type \"TIME\"\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\ncc @villebro @simcha90 @junlincc

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFollow up of #12930 .  Fix the table chart E2E test currently failing in master.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently query result formats are checked based on the `dtype` property of the `DataFrame` coming back from the database. This works for some types, but not\r\n- columns that contain nulls (a known limitation in Pandas which causes an otherwise regular `int` column to become  `object`)\r\n- date (=always `object`)\r\n- UTC based timestamps (all timestamps were `datetime64[ns, UTC]` on e.g. BigQuery when the `dtype` was cast to string, causing it to be returned as a non-temporal type)\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the current inference logic with the `infer_dtype` utility offered by Pandas and adds tests for typical column types. This is really just a quick fix to make table chart column types work properly, as we're currently inferring column datatypes in three (!) different places in the codebase. A bigger refactor uniting these into one place needs to be done ASAP, but is left to a later SIP/PR. This also bumps `superset-ui` to the latest version which includes a fix for the default temporal format: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/937\r\n\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nThis

SUMMARY\r\nOn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/12694 we started moving some required checks to the new .asf.yaml config that Apache provides. We started by testing just one job so that we could verify that it worked and we didn't inadvertently block any jobs by using the wrong job name. We have tested that the file is working, but there are some checks with duplicate names. This pr renames the duplicate jobs. In a subsequent PR(s), I will add the rest of the checks with the new job names. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nVerify that master requires the new jobs when this merges. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n- Hide dashboard header with name and edit button dependent on url parameter `standalone `\r\ne.g. http://localhost:8088/superset/dashboard/11/?standalone=true\r\nHere supported options (according proposal of @ktmud ):\r\na. `standalone=true` (for backward compatibility) or  `standalone=1` hide only navbar\r\nb. `standalone=2` hide navbar and title\r\nc. `standalone=false` (for backward compatibility) or  `no param` show all\r\n- Add global constants for url params\r\n\r\nReason for PR: When dashboard is embedded as standalone there is also a use-case to hide the dashboard

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is probably a little controversial, too.\r\n\r\nSometimes chart plugin `buildQuery` generates invalid `null` values for certain props (either because of sloppy code or uncleaned legacy data), making the whole query fails:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/106682085-9ed15f80-6576-11eb-8944-72c4b8334aab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince most of the props are optional anyway, maybe we should just make the backend more error-tolerant by allowing `null` (`None`) everywhere possible.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n- Added a unit test to check a query with `granularity: null` can still load and it has the same cache key as when `granularity` is not set.`\r\n\r\n- Manually tested by sending API request with null values to `/api/v1/chart/data`\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"datasource\": {\r\n\t\t\"id\": 27,\r\n\t\t\"type\": \"table\"\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"force\": false,\r\n\t\"queries\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"time_range\":

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis could be a somewhat controversial feature, but it doesn't seem to make much sense to display the Time section when the datasource has no time columns available. Shall we hide it for these datasources?\r\n\r\nOne downside of this is that the granularity and time range will reset to default when users change to a non-timeseries dataset then change it back to a timeseries dataset. The benefit is cleaner UI and less clutters for non-timeseries datasets.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1101\" alt=\"energy-use-yes-time\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/106671932-14800000-6564-11eb-83da-c0a21b33f150.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1107\" alt=\"energy-use-no-time\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/106671846-f1ede700-6563-11eb-9810-ab15024bc13b.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nManual verification:\r\n\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nLays the foundation for implementing superset's custom DBAPI exceptions from driver exceptions (following a @villebro idea/proposal). \r\n\r\nDBAPI drivers raise custom exceptions or straight unexpected exceptions, this causes several problems e.g.: UI messages with sensitive text, use of broad exceptions, not possible to use more fine grain actions when an error occurs at the DBAPI.\r\n\r\nFixes: #11822\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue: #11822\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently some of the `/api/v1/database/` API responses include the list of functions supported by the DB. This is currently only implemented in Presto and Hive, and both implementations need to query the 3rd party DB in order to get that list. If the DB is down or overloaded, this might time out or take too long to complete, affecting users who are trying to see the list of databases or using SQL Lab.\r\n\r\nIdeally we want to separate API calls that need to talk to 3rd party DBs (like Hive or Presto), from the calls that talk only to the main Superset DB. This PR changes the database response to **not include** the list of function names. This has been moved to a separate endpoint that is called asynchronously wherever needed (AFAIK only for autocomplete in SQL Lab).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI changed `superset.db_engine_specs.base.BaseEngineSpec.get_function_names` to return some fake data. Loaded SQL Lab and verified that they show up in the autocomplete, both when loading an existing tab as well as when creating a new one.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/12821, this PR removes more places where we unnecessarily close a connection cursor, causing exceptions to be logged in BigQuery.\r\n\r\nFor context, closing a connection closes the associated cursors, so explicitly closing the cursor immediately before closing the connection is not necessary. Also, BigQuery has a bug (already fixed but pending release) where it will raise an exception when closing a connection with an already closed cursor, resulting in errors polluting the logs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nTested by running queries in different places (SQL Lab query editor and metadata browser, charts), with both BigQuery and MySQL. Works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen running a statement in SQL Lab, after the query is finished we first close the cursor and then close the connection (using the `closing` context manager). This raises an exception in BigQuery due to a bug (https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/issues/497), and even though the exception is captured and the code works it pollutes the logs, creating an error entry **for every statement executed**.\r\n\r\nI created a PR fixing the bug upstream (https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/pull/498), but in the meantime we can prevent this from happening by simply not closing the cursor explicitly. This is possible because closing a connection will close all its cursors (the exception in BigQuery happens because it tries to close the already closed cursor).\r\n\r\nThis means we can replace this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith closing(engine.raw_connection()) as conn:\r\n    with closing(conn.cursor()) as cursor:\r\n        cursor.execute(sql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith closing(engine.raw_connection()) as conn:\r\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\r\n    cursor.execute(sql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, BigQuery will no longer try to close the closed cursor, keeping the logs clean.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nRan a simple query in BigQuery, and verified that the error message no longer shows up in the logs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThe aim of this PR was to standarize clicking magnifier action between dashboard filters and native filters. The implementation was created based on how it works for dashboard filers, so using `directPathToChild`.\r\n\r\nWhen users click filter indicator, the list of native filters and dashboard filters are presented. When users click magnifier next to a given dashboard filter, the component gets blue outline. The same should happen with native filters - when magnifier next to native filter is clicked, the given native filter input is focused.\r\n\r\nThis implementation fully supports 'Select inputs', as for now in Filter Bar there is `viz_type: 'filter_select' `. I have added a small support for range filters (by giving `inputRef` prop), but focusing that type of inputs should be investigated once again when they are widely used.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nConverting big integers to strings was previously done manually by looping over every single value in the

inserting the big integer conversion within that single loop over the full dataset.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up the overall record collection by a factor of ~2 (primarily because we're only looping through

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen we fetch samples for a given viz we need to ensure the `is_timeseries` attribute is false, otherwise Superset will add a group by on the temporal column, resuilting in an invalid column:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT ts AS ts,\r\n       name AS name,\r\n       text AS text,\r\n       DATE(ts) AS __timestamp  -- HERE\r\nFROM\r\n  (SELECT m.ts,\r\n          c.name,\r\n          m.text\r\n   FROM messages m\r\n   JOIN channels c ON m.channel_id = c.id) AS expr_qry\r\nWHERE ts >= STR_TO_DATE('2020-10-27 00:00:00.000000', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s.%f')\r\n  AND ts < STR_TO_DATE('2021-01-27 00:00:00.000000', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s.%f')\r\n  AND name != 'github-notifications'\r\nGROUP BY DATE(ts)  -- HERE\r\nLIMIT 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query above is invalid because the `GROUP BY` should contain all non-aggregation expressions from the `SELECT`.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, some charts fail to load their samples.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2021-01-27 Messages per

SUMMARY\r\nThe prop `partitionColumn` was not being passed  to `AdhocFilterPopoverTrigger` in `addNewFilterPopoverTrigger` of `AdhocFilterControl`, causing the latest partition operator to be missing for datasources that support it. The override of `valueRender` seemed to be a leftover from some old time, so it was removed and `partitionColumn` added to the original `valueRenderer` that's created in the constructor. In addition, the operator dropdown showed irrelevant operators, causing the operator count to be inflated. Also fixed a typo (\"operators(s)\" to \"operator(s)\") along with relevant translations.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: Partition operator is missing from dropdown. Also notice how the dropdown shows 13 operators, despite only 11 being visible:\r\n![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/105968706-15aabc00-6090-11eb-9323-6ee1cb8d1d6c.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter\r\nPartition operator pops up if column supports it. The placeholder is also updated to reflect the new operator count after the column has been selected:\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/105968841-41c63d00-6090-11eb-8497-2e0930e8a905.gif)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the

in prod\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nA misconfigured instance of the useEffect hook was causing the form validation to not run in prod builds. \r\n\r\nI'm guessing `useEffect` has some performance optimizations to minimize updates in prod. Since this is first run with an empty array, react likely disregards subsequent updates after the component is mounted. Usually an error is thrown when react detects changes in the dependency array length. I think the initial empty array is an exception as that has slightly different semantics.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nAfter:\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\nThe new tab shortcut for Windows is now `ctrl + q`.\r\n\r\nI created a `detectOS()` function in `superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor.jsx` that detects the user's OS through the browser and returns the OS as a string. I used this to create a ternary in the `getHotkeyConfig()` function to change the functionality of the new tab shortcut depending on the user's OS.\r\n\r\nI imported the `detectOS()` function into `superset-frontend/dist/src/SqlLab/components/TabbedSqlEditors.jsx` and `superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/TabbedSqlEditors.jsx` so that I could apply this functionality everywhere that the new tab shortcut occurs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nScreenshot of the tooltip while the user is not on Windows:\r\n<img width=\"569\" alt=\"notWindows\"
